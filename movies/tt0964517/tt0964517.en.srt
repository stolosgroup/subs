2
00:00:44,223 --> 00:00:46,454
Are you gonna...
You bringing Micky in?

3
00:00:46,465 --> 00:00:47,393
Yeah, he's here.

4
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,471
He should come.
He should be here as well.

5
00:00:49,495 --> 00:00:51,620
We thought that Micky is
coming to answer the questions.

6
00:00:51,643 --> 00:00:53,842
No, they said it was
going to be both of us.

7
00:00:54,883 --> 00:00:58,734
- Am I looking right into the camera here?
- Just look at me right now.

8
00:00:58,746 --> 00:01:00,239
All right.

9
00:01:00,262 --> 00:01:03,418
You're not going to look
at the camera with the interviews?

10
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:09,267
I started boxing when I was
twelve years old

11
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:11,885
and I lied and said I was eighteen
or whatever it was.

12
00:01:11,896 --> 00:01:13,810
I had a different name and everything.

13
00:01:13,822 --> 00:01:16,073
I mean, I don't have any fights,
I've done a hundred more than that

14
00:01:16,096 --> 00:01:18,636
before I turned professional.

15
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:20,490
This morning you said that...

16
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:22,169
- Why are we doing this?
- One more time.

17
00:01:22,193 --> 00:01:24,142
You want to go over it all?
You want to start again?

18
00:01:24,153 --> 00:01:27,617
He's my younger brother.
I taught him everything he knows.

19
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:29,840
I'm still his trainer.
I know we've got different styles,

20
00:01:29,863 --> 00:01:33,997
I'm fucking squirelly as fuck.
You know, like, I'm not even there.

21
00:01:34,003 --> 00:01:38,625
That's what Sugar Ray said. I was the
most tricky fighter he'd ever come across.

22
00:01:39,426 --> 00:01:44,040
'78, before Sugar Ray Leonard...
I told him he couldn't get to me.

23
00:01:44,064 --> 00:01:45,766
He couldn't get to me.

24
00:01:45,785 --> 00:01:48,709
They called me "The Pride of Lowell."

25
00:01:48,726 --> 00:01:51,509
Everybody still talks about it,
you know, especially my brother.

26
00:01:51,523 --> 00:01:53,907
His whole life he wanted to do
what I did, you know?

27
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,255
But we're very different fighters.

28
00:01:56,261 --> 00:02:02,026
Micky's a heavy hitter.
He's thunderous, I'm telling you.

29
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:03,856
Thunderous left punch.

30
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:07,366
Micky, he takes a punishment.
I don't know why he does it.

31
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:09,565
I'd say "You all right?"
He likes getting on the inside.

32
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:11,092
I stay on the outside.

33
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:41,619
Come on!

34
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:44,353
Dicky...

35
00:02:49,473 --> 00:02:51,228
Would you come on?

36
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:54,129
Stop.
You've got to help me finish this.

37
00:02:57,503 --> 00:02:58,619
Come on!

38
00:02:58,622 --> 00:03:00,829
Unpredictable as ever!

39
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:03,808
You don't have to be Columbo
to see where this fight is headed!

40
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:06,360
Yeah, bam!

41
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:09,247
All right, he punched Micky Ward down!

42
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:13,417
HBO's making a movie on me and
my comeback and my brother

43
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,078
is going to beat Saoul Mamby
in Atlanta next week!

44
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:21,931
The Pride of Lowell is back!

45
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:24,132
Quacker!

46
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,734
Who wants some?
Who wants some?

48
00:03:49,465 --> 00:03:51,021
I want a cut.

49
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:55,194
Doing good?

50
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:57,261
You guys having a good day?

51
00:03:57,673 --> 00:03:59,065
How are you?

52
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:04,819
Come on. Come on. What you got?
What you got going on?

53
00:04:05,338 --> 00:04:07,941
Lou! Hey, Lou DiBella!

54
00:04:07,945 --> 00:04:10,775
How are you guys, huh?

55
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,882
I'm making my comeback.

56
00:04:17,731 --> 00:04:20,121
Hey, Marty, Marty.
Come out here, huh?

57
00:04:36,487 --> 00:04:38,002
Hey!

58
00:04:38,008 --> 00:04:41,237
HBO is making a movie on me!

59
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:42,945
Hey, beautiful.

60
00:04:49,443 --> 00:04:51,054
You got that?

61
00:04:51,062 --> 00:04:54,557
Can't remember who she is.
I can't remember shit!

62
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:57,195
Hey!
Hey, Garcia!

63
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,089
How are you, nice?

64
00:05:00,788 --> 00:05:03,168
How'd you get here?
Drive around?

65
00:05:03,184 --> 00:05:06,264
Hey, Ray. Hey.
I love you, Ray.

66
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:08,504
This is what it's all about.

67
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:35,156
He make mistake?

68
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,359
No, he'll be here.
Like I said,

69
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:39,989
sometimes he goes on his own schedule,
but when he gets here we work hard.

70
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:41,927
Nobody pushes me harder than him.

71
00:05:41,938 --> 00:05:44,634
He's supposed to be
training you right now, right?

72
00:05:44,648 --> 00:05:46,466
Why don't you just go talk to them,
my sisters?

73
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:48,685
They'll talk your ear off.
You gotta pay them to shut up.

74
00:05:48,697 --> 00:05:51,183
He can tell you how
Dicky was helping him.

75
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,867
Come on, Micky.

76
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:54,845
Okay.

77
00:05:56,597 --> 00:05:58,150
Hey, we don't know where Dicky is.

78
00:05:58,161 --> 00:05:59,982
You know where he is.

79
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:19,135
What's that dumb cop doing in there?

80
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:20,943
Where's Dicky?
Girls?

81
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,732
- I don't know.
- You see him this morning?

82
00:06:22,743 --> 00:06:24,798
Your brother?
Not this morning.

83
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:27,047
Look at Mom!
All dressed up for the movie, huh?

84
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,712
You are smoking hot!

85
00:06:29,832 --> 00:06:32,843
Get out of the ring, O'Keefe.
My Dicky should be doing that.

86
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:34,759
Dicky ain't here, Alice.

87
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:38,894
Micky's got an important fight
coming up and he's not training.

88
00:06:38,906 --> 00:06:40,714
- Forget about him. Never mind about him.
- He's not doing what he's supposed to do with him.

89
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:43,608
- Start saying to Micky...
- He's not part of this, all right?

90
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:46,015
- Alice, he's not being handled right.
- Did you get me coming in all right?

91
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:48,340
You want me to do it again?
Get out of the ring, O'Keefe.

92
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:50,717
- Dicky's the trainer.
- I'm doing him favor, Alice.

93
00:06:50,723 --> 00:06:52,821
I will show you over here

94
00:06:52,844 --> 00:06:56,179
these scrapbooks I have been
collecting for years.

95
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,001
Micky used to follow
his big brother everywhere.

96
00:06:59,013 --> 00:07:01,080
Taught you everything, didn't he, honey?

97
00:07:01,092 --> 00:07:05,479
In '78 we got the offer
to fight Sugar Ray Leonard.

98
00:07:05,498 --> 00:07:08,164
Oh, my God. Have you seen that video?
Well, you're from HBO,

99
00:07:08,175 --> 00:07:11,427
you've got to see it again!
Come on. Where's the video at?

100
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:21,352
Tonight my son is going to surprise
everybody and beat Sugar Ray Leonard.

101
00:07:21,364 --> 00:07:23,397
Believe me. I know it.

102
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,521
Sugar Ray might have some trouble tonight.

103
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:31,054
That's a good possibility.
He comes in here against a good boxer,

104
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:33,050
a young man who can punch,

105
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:36,980
and I would like to say at this time
that physically they're just about equal.

106
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,976
Leonard is down.
Let's see if that's a knockout.

107
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:02,841
This is unbelievable.

108
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:09,284
Eklund just walked over there.
Nobody seems to know what's happening.

109
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:16,758
Dicky did it.

110
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,395
Dicky did it.

111
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:21,617
Dicky did it!

112
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:23,871
Aren't you supposed to be
training Micky right now?

113
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,416
No, it ain't until 9:00.

114
00:08:25,426 --> 00:08:27,904
Dicky, it's fucking 11:45.

115
00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:30,866
- It's 11:45, Dick.
- What?

116
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:33,096
Where'd you fucking
park the car, Boo Boo?

117
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,251
- I didn't park it. You did.
- Huh?

118
00:08:35,275 --> 00:08:37,973
Check your fucking pockets for the keys.
You've got the keys, huh?

119
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,715
I didn't park it, man.

120
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,149
- Not here. I don't know...
- Check your pockets, all right?

121
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:46,480
Oh, fuck it, I'll run.
I need the fucking road work.

122
00:08:46,504 --> 00:08:49,639
Road work?
Are you crazy?

123
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,192
He's a great runner.

124
00:09:16,818 --> 00:09:17,910
Hey.

125
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:20,112
Hey!

126
00:09:22,014 --> 00:09:24,175
- I'm here!
- Hey, Dicky.

127
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:26,164
Better late than never.

128
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:28,303
Here, look.

129
00:09:28,315 --> 00:09:30,200
Detectives on the scene...

130
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:35,501
Get to the bar with this...

131
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,465
- Figure this one out, huh?
- Why don't you...

132
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,488
Hold it. Hold it.
Let me get this straight.

133
00:09:41,512 --> 00:09:44,749
You guys are working in the same corner
as Micky, together, right?

134
00:09:44,772 --> 00:09:47,217
Yeah.
Yeah, they're both in my corner.

135
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:49,223
- This is what goes on.
- Okay. It must be...

136
00:09:49,246 --> 00:09:51,335
Don't you have a job to
go to or something?

137
00:09:51,346 --> 00:09:54,047
Really, O'Keefe has a job
that he should be at.

138
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,661
Yeah, Sergeant O'Keefe's
working overtime here.

139
00:09:56,669 --> 00:10:01,155
So we go at this old man:
Jewish, black, former world champion.

140
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,951
I think we've got
all the bases covered.

141
00:10:02,974 --> 00:10:07,342
And my kid brother,
he's lost three fights in a row.

142
00:10:07,354 --> 00:10:09,397
He can't get used to losing.
It's a mental thing.

143
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,945
But we're gonna break that
with Mamby, right?

144
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,543
Yeah, I hope.
When we can train.

145
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:16,209
When we train. Right.
Don't be wasting time, Mick, you know?

146
00:10:16,225 --> 00:10:17,881
- Wasting time?
- Half the fucking day's gone.

147
00:10:17,904 --> 00:10:21,514
Yeah, half the day's gone.
I've been waiting for you.

148
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:55,750
Come on, move.
We're going to outbox Mamby, huh?

149
00:10:57,412 --> 00:11:01,005
- Take it out on the head.
- Head, body, head. That's your combo.

150
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:03,613
Head, body, head, body.
My Dicky taught him that.

151
00:11:03,636 --> 00:11:06,053
You know,
Sugar Ray's going to be there

152
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,361
calling the fight for ESPN.

153
00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:12,269
I ain't seen him since
I knocked him down,

154
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:15,329
like, fourteen years ago
or something, right?

155
00:11:16,964 --> 00:11:19,183
Let's get a real sparring going on here.

156
00:11:19,206 --> 00:11:21,144
Don't want to embarrass yourself.

157
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,874
Don't want to embarrass yourself
in front of Sugar Ray, huh?

158
00:11:24,427 --> 00:11:26,149
Come on, head, body, head.

159
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:30,641
Your punch, man!

160
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:35,455
That's your punch. Now that's your little punch.
Use your whole fucking body now.

161
00:11:35,473 --> 00:11:39,621
George's fingers are so fucking big
he can't even dial the phone!

162
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,512
That's not helping, George!

163
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:47,281
- Wait, I'm confused.
- What?

164
00:11:47,304 --> 00:11:49,218
- I'm confused, too.
- We're confused.

165
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,579
- George is whose father?
- You're confused?

166
00:11:51,602 --> 00:11:56,907
Dick Eklund Sr. is Dicky's,
Donna's, Gail's and Phyllis' father.

167
00:11:56,914 --> 00:11:58,616
- Dick Eklund.
- Yeah.

168
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,974
And even though Alice is an Eklund,
so are Cindy and Cathy.

169
00:12:01,998 --> 00:12:03,970
George is really...

170
00:12:03,992 --> 00:12:06,152
- And Micky...
- No.

171
00:12:06,174 --> 00:12:08,005
Micky and I are Wards.

172
00:12:08,851 --> 00:12:12,981
It's always sounded like Dick Eklund
and I were separated, right?

173
00:12:13,004 --> 00:12:15,329
- And then there was George.
- Just George.

174
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:17,783
- George is my man.
- George is our papa.

175
00:12:17,806 --> 00:12:20,497
After Dick, it was just George.

176
00:12:31,012 --> 00:12:32,709
Come on.
Come over here...

177
00:12:50,943 --> 00:12:54,377
Why don't you just go talk to her?
She's a nice girl.

178
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:56,135
I told her all about you.

179
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,740
I don't want to ask her.
She's going to say no.

180
00:13:01,112 --> 00:13:03,175
Can't beat that ass, can you?

181
00:13:03,813 --> 00:13:06,078
Get at it. Go.
Come on.

182
00:13:14,486 --> 00:13:16,929
Are you just going to stand there
and stare at my ass?

183
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,959
Your father stares at my ass
but he talks to me.

184
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,598
He thinks you're the greatest.

185
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:25,369
- He didn't tell me you were new.
- Keep the change, doll.

186
00:13:25,393 --> 00:13:27,071
He told me you came for you sister.

187
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:28,866
- This is a tip?
- Yeah, that's my tip!

188
00:13:28,888 --> 00:13:30,799
You know what the bell says
about this one?

189
00:13:30,818 --> 00:13:33,507
Cheap bastard.
Cheap fucker.

190
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,280
Comes in every day,
gives me shitty tips.

191
00:13:36,303 --> 00:13:37,979
Yeah, fuck you, too.

192
00:13:39,609 --> 00:13:41,605
You pave streets, right?

193
00:13:41,628 --> 00:13:43,425
Yeah, I do. And I'm a fighter.

194
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:45,503
Oh, yeah. I heard you're a stepping stone.

195
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:47,922
- I'm no stepping stone.
- Mm.

196
00:13:47,938 --> 00:13:50,110
You're the guy they use

197
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:53,410
against the other fighters
to move the other fighters up.

198
00:13:53,425 --> 00:13:55,656
I've had a few tough fights,
but that's not who I am.

199
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,090
The next fight's going to show who I am.

200
00:13:58,114 --> 00:14:00,348
Yeah, and he's going to
lose that one, too.

201
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:03,178
Scotch and soda, Charlene.
And one for yourself.

202
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:05,679
Now move that sugar ass...

203
00:14:07,537 --> 00:14:09,956
Okay, be respectful.
Don't disrespect her.

204
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:12,850
Hey, don't hurt your hand.
You've got a fight next week.

205
00:14:12,862 --> 00:14:14,787
Besides,
you wipe your ass with that one.

206
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,607
Don't wait up, or I'm going to hit
you in the car, sucker, all right?

207
00:14:17,619 --> 00:14:19,932
He's gonna be so lame.

208
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:22,996
All right?
All right?

209
00:14:24,503 --> 00:14:25,525
That's right.

210
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,484
Take your drink.
He's taking his drink.

211
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,867
This guy's going to be champion.
He's a great guy. He's a great fighter.

212
00:14:31,886 --> 00:14:34,426
Okay? Hold on.
Thanks for the drink.

213
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:36,774
You know those cameras
are making a movie about him?

214
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:38,633
He knocked out Sugar Ray Leonard

215
00:14:38,656 --> 00:14:40,993
on HBO. That's why they're following
him around with the cameras.

216
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:42,919
They're making a movie
about his comeback.

217
00:14:42,931 --> 00:14:45,902
Yeah, everybody's talking about it.
But who are you fighting?

218
00:14:45,925 --> 00:14:48,520
- Saoul Mamby.
- Saoul Mamby?

219
00:14:48,537 --> 00:14:50,906
- What kind of name is that?
- Black and Jewish.

220
00:14:51,998 --> 00:14:53,712
Where did they find a guy like that?

221
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,874
He's no joke.
Former world champion.

222
00:14:55,898 --> 00:14:57,751
- Former champ?
- Yeah.

223
00:14:58,246 --> 00:15:00,283
- I match up good with him, though.
- Yeah?

224
00:15:00,295 --> 00:15:02,358
- Yeah.
- What does that mean?

225
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,430
Well, I got a light end, you know?

226
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:06,590
I've got a reputation for brawling,
but I'm not going to brawl with him.

227
00:15:06,602 --> 00:15:09,303
- I'm going to try to box him.
- There's a difference?

228
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,296
Yeah, in brawling you slug it out.
I hit you. You hit me.

229
00:15:12,307 --> 00:15:13,963
Boxing is a chess game, you know?

230
00:15:13,985 --> 00:15:15,840
Got to pick my punches
to take him down.

231
00:15:15,852 --> 00:15:17,909
I'm going head, body, head, body...

232
00:15:19,063 --> 00:15:20,994
What is head, body, head, body?

233
00:15:21,018 --> 00:15:24,869
Well, I hit him in the head, then his
hands got to go up to protect himself.

234
00:15:24,887 --> 00:15:29,394
Opens up his body, then I hit him in the body,
hand goes back down. I go back up to the head,

235
00:15:29,418 --> 00:15:31,496
hand goes back, and I hit him in the body.

236
00:15:31,508 --> 00:15:34,420
People who don't know fighting think
you do a lot of damage hitting the head,

237
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:36,839
but you actually do more hitting the body.

238
00:15:37,994 --> 00:15:39,799
So what do you think?
Can I take you out?

239
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,768
Are you married?

240
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,702
No, would I ask you out if I was married?
What kind of guy do you think I am?

241
00:15:47,722 --> 00:15:49,312
Happens all the time, trust me.

242
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,705
I'm not like that.

243
00:15:51,944 --> 00:15:54,116
I'm not married. I've got a daughter,
I see her every other weekend.

244
00:15:54,128 --> 00:15:55,924
Her name is Kasie.
But that's it.

245
00:15:56,878 --> 00:15:58,622
Come on, let me take you out.

246
00:16:00,728 --> 00:16:02,050
When?

247
00:16:02,548 --> 00:16:04,393
Saturday night I'll be
back in Atlantic City.

248
00:16:21,738 --> 00:16:23,211
Is this the real number?

249
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:25,080
You'll have to call it and see.

250
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:26,414
I will.

251
00:16:26,426 --> 00:16:28,293
Saturday. Dinner and a movie.

252
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,002
- Hey. What's up?
- Dicky, hey. How's it going?

253
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:55,071
I don't think Laurie's
expecting you right now.

254
00:16:55,094 --> 00:16:58,606
What's he doing here?
This isn't your visitation day, Micky.

255
00:16:59,468 --> 00:17:01,629
I just want to say hi to Kasie.

256
00:17:01,644 --> 00:17:03,311
It's not your day, goodbye.

257
00:17:03,324 --> 00:17:05,260
Yeah, but I'm not around next week.

258
00:17:05,272 --> 00:17:06,998
Now you're ditching
the days you do have?

259
00:17:07,021 --> 00:17:08,830
No, I have a fight.
I told you that.

260
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:14,417
- Jimmy...
- I can't get in the middle.

261
00:17:14,437 --> 00:17:17,630
I can't talk to her, okay?
So I'm asking you, Jimmy.

262
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:20,050
I want to talk to my daughter now.

263
00:17:20,074 --> 00:17:22,528
- Talk to your father.
- God damn it, Jimmy.

264
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:24,640
Hi, Daddy.
Daddy's gonna beat Saoul Mamby.

265
00:17:24,663 --> 00:17:28,597
That's right. And I'm gonna tell you that
after I win, I'm gonna start making big money.

266
00:17:28,609 --> 00:17:30,875
And I'll move into a bigger apartment,
like we talked about,

267
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:33,259
- so you can live with me more days, okay?
- Yeah, a bigger apartment!

268
00:17:33,282 --> 00:17:35,760
- Wish me luck, all right?
- Don't hold your breath, Kasie.

269
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,043
It's cruel to mislead your child, Micky.

270
00:17:38,056 --> 00:17:41,507
- Good luck, Daddy.
- Thanks, Kasie. I love you, honey.

271
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,787
Bye, baby.

272
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:48,693
- Where is he?
- Jesus Christ. Fucking holding us up.

273
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,863
- Quit your worrying, for crying out loud.
- All that shit in my face...

274
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:03,445
I know it's none of my business.
I go to a lot of meetings,

275
00:18:03,468 --> 00:18:06,561
and they have a saying:
"Let go and let God."

276
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,965
- You've got to let him go, Mick.
- He's taught me everything I know.

277
00:18:08,977 --> 00:18:11,830
He's been in my corner.
I can't do it without him.

278
00:18:11,846 --> 00:18:15,014
- You're already doing it without him.
- No I'm not.

279
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:16,783
- Yes you are.
- Look, you know where he is.

280
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:19,196
Why don't you just go get him?

281
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:20,652
Can you get him?

282
00:18:20,663 --> 00:18:22,307
I'm not fucking going to get him.

283
00:18:22,331 --> 00:18:25,461
Well are we all going to go over there
in the limo with Alice? We can't do that.

284
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,108
Dicky.

285
00:18:38,012 --> 00:18:41,490
- Your mother's outside.
- What?

286
00:18:41,505 --> 00:18:45,116
Uh-oh, Dicky, your mother's outside.
She's down there.

287
00:18:49,393 --> 00:18:50,927
I'm not here.

288
00:18:56,646 --> 00:18:58,889
Don't, Dicky.
Dicky!

289
00:19:03,715 --> 00:19:06,169
What the fuck are you doing?
You know we've got to go to the airport now.

290
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,879
We've got a flight to catch.

291
00:19:07,887 --> 00:19:10,102
You know how important this fight is to me.

292
00:19:11,064 --> 00:19:13,753
- Don't tell Mom I'm here, all right?
- She knows.

293
00:19:13,774 --> 00:19:16,521
- Pick me up back at the house, all right?
- Are you fucking...

294
00:19:16,544 --> 00:19:18,082
She's in the driveway right now.

295
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,096
All right, but hurry up.
She's in the fucking driveway.

296
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:24,527
- We've got a flight to catch.
- You do this on the day your brother's traveling?

297
00:19:26,351 --> 00:19:28,347
- What are you doing?
- Just trying to see what I have.

298
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:30,491
- The fuck did you hit him for?
- Why'd you make me do that to you?

299
00:19:30,514 --> 00:19:31,653
- Jesus!
- Oh, my God, Dicky...

300
00:19:31,677 --> 00:19:33,438
I was on my way, Mom.

301
00:19:33,453 --> 00:19:35,355
- What are you doing?
- No, Mom. Mom...

302
00:19:36,846 --> 00:19:40,006
Why can't we just go to the
fucking airport for once, please?

303
00:19:40,898 --> 00:19:43,576
Hey, Alice, what about your husband who's
laying on the fucking ground over here?

304
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,149
You want to help your husband?

305
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:47,989
What are you doing, running in here
like a silverback fucking gorilla?

306
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,617
- We had to get him, didn't we?
- Oh, yeah, you got him, pal.

307
00:20:10,117 --> 00:20:11,808
You see Mamby?

308
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:15,330
See how Mamby's arm comes up?
Leaves his side open,

309
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,659
you just play him up like a pinball machine.

310
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,946
He'll be pissing blood.
No way you'll lose, Mick. No way.

311
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,291
- Hey, Lou.
- Dicky, boy.

312
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:24,146
Hey listen, boy.

313
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,919
ESPN can't get us better rooms than this?

314
00:20:25,927 --> 00:20:28,651
I wouldn't worry about the rooms right now,
Dicky. You've got bigger headaches.

315
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,155
Like what?

316
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:32,832
The doctor won't let Mamby fight.

317
00:20:32,855 --> 00:20:34,117
Why not?

318
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,477
- He's got the flu.
- Mamby got the flu?

319
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,412
Yeah.

320
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,985
Dicky, we can still have a fight.

321
00:20:38,997 --> 00:20:41,890
- With who?
- Mike Mungin.

322
00:20:41,913 --> 00:20:43,381
Mike Mungin, who's that?

323
00:20:43,403 --> 00:20:46,842
- Guy from Philly. Been in prison.
- He's been out a few months.

324
00:20:46,855 --> 00:20:50,530
I've called everybody, checked everywhere.
He's the only guy I could find.

325
00:20:50,554 --> 00:20:53,372
My last three fights were rough, Lou.
I mean this one's supposed to be easier.

326
00:20:53,396 --> 00:20:55,364
We've been fucking preparing for Mamby.

327
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:58,804
Right, but this guy just came off the couch.
He's been sitting on his ass.

328
00:20:58,816 --> 00:21:01,516
Could be an easy win for Mick.

329
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:04,410
Joey Farrell, remember him?
He knocked his ass out.

330
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:08,235
- And you knocked down Joey Farrell...
- Exactly, and Mungin just got off the couch.

331
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:10,185
Can't make weight.
Might be a bit over, though.

332
00:21:10,207 --> 00:21:11,357
How over?

333
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:14,728
- 162, 165...
- 165?

334
00:21:15,444 --> 00:21:17,792
Micky dropped weight.
He's 146.

335
00:21:17,803 --> 00:21:21,437
Lou, we prepared for Mamby, all right?
We prepared for Mamby!

336
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:24,589
This guy just got off the couch.
Micky's in shape.

337
00:21:24,606 --> 00:21:27,882
Road work, everything else.
This other guy hasn't done dick.

338
00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:31,118
Don't forget.
You don't fight, nobody gets paid.

339
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:42,280
Lou, please...

340
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,421
All right. Um,
Joey Farrell knocked him out...

341
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:48,194
Going to be a hell of a fight, huh?

342
00:21:48,205 --> 00:21:50,478
I'm not doing this.
165 is big.

343
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:53,438
- You knocked down Joey Farrell.
- So what? He's a middleweight.

344
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:55,283
He just got off the couch.

345
00:21:55,306 --> 00:21:57,713
He's got twenty pounds on me, Dicky.

346
00:21:57,737 --> 00:22:00,636
Joey Farrell knocked him out.
You knocked down Joey Farrell.

347
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,791
- You just said that.
- Yeah but... You can't be scared.

348
00:22:03,803 --> 00:22:04,789
- Scared?
- Yeah.

349
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,761
- Why don't you go fucking fight him?
- I'll go fucking fight him. He's fat.

350
00:22:06,773 --> 00:22:10,378
Go snap out the teeth. It's your big comeback,
right? That's what Alice wants.

351
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:13,072
You knocked down Joey Farrell.

352
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:16,357
All right, I knocked down Joey Farrell, okay?
But the guy is a middleweight.

353
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,429
I'm a welterweight. What, they don't have
a fucking heavyweight to tow in there with me?

354
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,106
Tell him, Dicky. He can do it, right?
He can do anything.

355
00:22:22,129 --> 00:22:24,667
Yeah, Alice. No problem.

356
00:22:24,688 --> 00:22:27,281
You watch from the outside now.

357
00:22:27,293 --> 00:22:32,530
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mike "Machine Gun" Mungin!

358
00:22:34,226 --> 00:22:35,884
Holy shit!

359
00:22:36,465 --> 00:22:38,996
Hey, look.
There's Sugar Ray Leonard.

360
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,753
Hey, Ray. Sugar Ray.
Over here.

361
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:45,752
Dicky, come on.
Look at the size of that guy.

362
00:22:46,828 --> 00:22:48,977
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, holy shit.

363
00:22:48,989 --> 00:22:51,629
That guy's no welterweight.

364
00:22:51,654 --> 00:22:54,484
All right, Mick. Gonna have to learn
to fuss you around. It's time now.

365
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:58,001
He did not just get off the fucking couch.
If he did, I want to buy a couch like that.

366
00:22:58,013 --> 00:23:01,253
I don't care who that guy is.
I don't care. Look at me.

367
00:23:01,265 --> 00:23:04,862
You're Micky Ward.
You're Micky Ward.

368
00:23:08,202 --> 00:23:11,234
Micky Ward fighting a last-minute
replacement from Philadelphia,

369
00:23:11,246 --> 00:23:13,946
a much bigger man.

370
00:23:13,955 --> 00:23:17,430
Punches smashing Ward.

371
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:22,702
Ward goes down!
Ward goes down!

372
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,239
Micky, what the fuck is wrong?
Get rid of this dude!

373
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:36,741
Mungin didn't even know
he'd be fighting today...

374
00:23:40,885 --> 00:23:42,677
Come on, now, Mick!

375
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,883
Ward, a respected fighter. You hope
this mismatch doesn't hurt his confidence.

376
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:51,231
- You're a loser!
- Loser!

377
00:23:51,232 --> 00:23:53,122
You're a loser!

378
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:25,718
Ray! Hey, Ray! Ray!

379
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:29,896
Hey, Dicky!

380
00:24:29,907 --> 00:24:33,356
- How are you doing, man?
- How are you?

381
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:36,749
165 pounds. ESPN screwed us.

382
00:24:36,761 --> 00:24:39,849
- The guy was huge.
- You know what I'm saying?

383
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,441
You know, I knocked Ray down.

384
00:24:42,465 --> 00:24:44,942
I look like shit, but I knocked Ray down.

385
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:47,326
Let me buy you guys a drink,
all right? You want a cold one?

386
00:24:47,343 --> 00:24:48,743
- No, no, no...
- A cold one!

387
00:24:48,757 --> 00:24:51,650
I've got to leave.
I've got a plane to catch. Next time.

388
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:54,606
Hey, Ray. HBO is making
a movie on me, you know?

389
00:24:55,693 --> 00:24:57,511
Can they call you?

390
00:24:57,535 --> 00:24:59,543
I'm going to get a fight.

391
00:24:59,554 --> 00:25:02,407
I'd like you to be there, for old times' sake.
You can commentate or something.

392
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:04,267
What's the movie about?

393
00:25:04,288 --> 00:25:06,319
My comeback, right?

394
00:25:06,343 --> 00:25:09,333
- Call me.
- I'll call you.

395
00:25:09,348 --> 00:25:11,878
Don't be a stranger.

396
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,217
He's my old pal.

397
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:19,856
- You going to the hospital?
- What is that?

398
00:25:21,273 --> 00:25:23,668
Look, Mick. Nobody's got heart like you.

399
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:26,487
You're a very talented fighter,
but you're not getting the right fights.

400
00:25:26,507 --> 00:25:28,246
It's killing your chances.

401
00:25:28,258 --> 00:25:30,430
- What's he talking to Mike Toma about?
- I don't know what that is.

402
00:25:30,453 --> 00:25:32,284
I want to give you a real shot.

403
00:25:32,308 --> 00:25:35,689
I want you to come with me.
I want to pay you to train with my guys.

404
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:37,563
- Where?
- Las Vegas.

405
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:40,562
Do it right and make one last run
at this thing before it's too late.

406
00:25:40,585 --> 00:25:42,350
What about my brother?

407
00:25:42,361 --> 00:25:44,968
With all due respect,
he's too much trouble.

408
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:48,057
You owe it to yourself to come to Vegas.

409
00:25:48,069 --> 00:25:50,805
Come on, Mick. What has Dicky done for you?

410
00:25:50,828 --> 00:25:53,775
He gets you into fights.
He lets you get beat like you did tonight.

411
00:25:53,787 --> 00:25:57,662
You know you never should have been in that fight.
Eighteen pounds. Think of it that way.

412
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:59,312
You should have given it up.

413
00:26:01,073 --> 00:26:03,727
Get out of the car there. Come on, you!

414
00:26:03,739 --> 00:26:06,490
- Sit the hell down.
- Just a little more scotch for Mom, okay?

415
00:26:06,502 --> 00:26:10,733
Here you go. Nice and easy.
Don't hurt yourself coming back, old broad.

416
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:15,762
Oh, my God, that Sugar Ray...
He's a beautiful man, isn't he? Right?

417
00:26:15,772 --> 00:26:17,334
A beautiful man.

418
00:26:17,357 --> 00:26:19,330
You should have seen the way
he was looking at her.

419
00:26:20,321 --> 00:26:23,109
- He's a pretty man, huh?
- He's a good guy. I like him. I know.

420
00:26:23,128 --> 00:26:26,474
I seen him ringside, and he was
so happy seeing me and Mick together.

421
00:26:26,492 --> 00:26:29,768
You know he's all about family, that guy.
Likes to see a family stick together.

422
00:26:29,786 --> 00:26:33,479
Mick, what'd Mike Toma want
with you last night, huh?

423
00:26:33,499 --> 00:26:36,012
He wants to train me in Vegas.

424
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:38,471
You can't trust that guy, Micky.
He ain't family, you know?

425
00:26:38,495 --> 00:26:39,880
You don't know him.

426
00:26:39,904 --> 00:26:43,126
He say anything about me?
He say I could come?

427
00:26:43,138 --> 00:26:44,934
He didn't mention you.

428
00:26:46,943 --> 00:26:49,796
What are you going to do in Vegas
without your brother, huh?

429
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:52,048
That guy just wants to use you,
like a piece of toilet paper.

430
00:26:52,071 --> 00:26:55,194
What are you going to do in Vegas
without Dicky? Without your family?

431
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,498
- I know. That's what I told him.
- You told him that, right?

432
00:26:57,522 --> 00:27:00,246
Yeah, I told him. I said
I need to be with my family.

433
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:02,880
That's right.
Nothing wrong with that.

434
00:27:02,904 --> 00:27:05,686
Sugar Ray said call him.
We're going to call him, baby.

435
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,176
You guys can spar a little, right?

436
00:27:10,353 --> 00:27:14,932
There's my champ.
Daddy's home. Daddy's home!

437
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:17,927
I love you...

438
00:27:19,653 --> 00:27:21,484
Your face hurting you, sweetheart?

439
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,699
Because it's killing me.

440
00:27:25,423 --> 00:27:27,325
- Come on...
- Uncle Micky win the fight?

441
00:27:27,347 --> 00:27:29,908
No, Uncle Micky didn't win this time.
Not this time.

442
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,841
Hey, Mick. Take care.
I'll call you tomorrow.

443
00:27:33,865 --> 00:27:36,260
Cheer up. We'll get you another fight.

444
00:27:36,269 --> 00:27:38,864
I don't know, Mom.
I don't think I want to do this no more.

445
00:27:38,887 --> 00:27:41,825
- What don't you want to do no more?
- I just don't want to do it anymore.

446
00:27:41,847 --> 00:27:44,691
- What are you talking...
- Hey, Mick.

447
00:27:44,714 --> 00:27:47,567
ESPN screwed us. They owe us.

448
00:27:47,568 --> 00:27:50,781
We'll get another fight.
You heal up.

449
00:27:50,804 --> 00:27:53,176
- It'll be okay.
- Yeah, listen to your brother.

450
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,469
They owe us big-time, sweetheart.

451
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:58,612
Hey, maybe they'll even do Dicky's
comeback fight. What do you think, huh?

452
00:27:59,634 --> 00:28:02,628
Oh, come on. Cheer up.
You take a little soap when you get home.

453
00:28:02,651 --> 00:28:04,859
Have a day or two to think about it.
I'll find you a better fight, sweetheart.

454
00:28:04,882 --> 00:28:06,667
Much better fight.
I'm going to talk to them.

455
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:09,246
- For Christ's sake, Alice.
- What?

456
00:28:09,258 --> 00:28:12,303
- He's been through the ringer. Leave him alone.
- What are you talking about?

457
00:28:12,328 --> 00:28:15,358
- Leave him some time to himself.
- What is your fucking problem?

458
00:28:15,992 --> 00:28:18,240
Where's Micky?
Is Micky not going to come in?

459
00:28:18,252 --> 00:28:22,118
No, he's not coming in.
He needs to get back and get some rest.

460
00:28:22,142 --> 00:28:23,699
Come on. Let's go inside.

461
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:26,032
He's going to go rest.
He's all grumpy.

462
00:28:26,044 --> 00:28:29,085
He's tired. He's beat up.
He's a little embarrassed, I think.

463
00:29:28,194 --> 00:29:29,721
Who is it?

464
00:29:51,355 --> 00:29:53,249
I saw the shade move.

465
00:29:54,343 --> 00:29:56,703
Micky, the shade is still moving.
I saw you come to the window.

466
00:29:56,727 --> 00:29:58,289
I know you're in there.

467
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,002
The least you can do
is open up this door

468
00:30:01,025 --> 00:30:03,561
and tell me to my face
why you didn't call me yesterday.

469
00:30:09,685 --> 00:30:11,211
Why did you stand me up last night?

470
00:30:12,801 --> 00:30:16,019
I started to call.
I was going to call. I just couldn't.

471
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:17,608
Because you lost the fight?

472
00:30:17,629 --> 00:30:20,435
Maybe, yeah.
Because I lost the fight.

473
00:30:20,447 --> 00:30:22,358
How do you know my house anyway?

474
00:30:22,374 --> 00:30:25,203
I asked my brother.

475
00:30:25,204 --> 00:30:29,148
Your thing's coming off.
And your other thing.

476
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:32,957
You got any tape?

477
00:30:40,874 --> 00:30:43,520
Did the black Jewish guy
do this to you?

478
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:46,703
I didn't get to fight the black Jewish guy.

479
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:50,176
You didn't get to go head, body, head?

480
00:30:51,262 --> 00:30:53,563
Saoul Mamby got the flu.

481
00:30:53,587 --> 00:30:56,769
Guy that took his place had twenty pounds
on me. I never should have fought him.

482
00:30:58,383 --> 00:31:00,122
Why did you?

483
00:31:00,145 --> 00:31:02,490
Nobody would have got paid.

484
00:31:03,454 --> 00:31:06,000
Everybody said I could beat him.

485
00:31:06,011 --> 00:31:08,465
Who's everybody?

486
00:31:08,477 --> 00:31:10,128
My mother and my brother.

487
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,971
So are you going to take me
to dinner and a movie, or what?

488
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,277
- Hey.
- Hey.

489
00:31:49,555 --> 00:31:51,562
- You look great.
- Thank you.

490
00:31:51,574 --> 00:31:53,432
You've got a nice house, too.

491
00:31:53,456 --> 00:31:54,876
It's an apartment building.

492
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,527
There's five of them in there.
One of my old roommates lives with me.

493
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,206
Roommate?
What, were you in the army?

494
00:31:59,229 --> 00:32:01,412
- College.
- College? Wow.

495
00:32:01,424 --> 00:32:04,183
Yeah, a lot of good it did me.
I work in a bar.

496
00:32:04,206 --> 00:32:06,848
You seem to enjoy it.
Very popular down there.

497
00:32:06,864 --> 00:32:09,753
Ugh, yeah. Popular.
I've got to get out of there.

498
00:32:09,776 --> 00:32:12,617
If I don't drink while I'm working
I'll fucking kill myself.

499
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:15,740
- What college?
- URI. Full boat.

500
00:32:15,756 --> 00:32:18,020
- A full boat's a scholarship, right?
- Yeah.

501
00:32:18,032 --> 00:32:19,487
For what?

502
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:22,959
- I was a high-jumper.
- High-jumper? You've got to be kidding me.

503
00:32:22,961 --> 00:32:26,355
Fuck you. I was good.
I was New England champ. I cleared 5'8".

504
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:29,267
- Wow.
- Never graduated. I partied too hard.

505
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,629
You?

506
00:32:46,213 --> 00:32:48,104
What are we doing in richie-rich Lexington?

507
00:32:48,127 --> 00:32:49,665
You come to this theater a lot?

508
00:32:49,681 --> 00:32:51,724
Yeah, it's a good theater.
They've got good movies here.

509
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,801
- Yeah? Like what?
- Belly Epi-cue.

510
00:32:54,825 --> 00:32:56,875
I think it's Bell Epic.

511
00:32:56,899 --> 00:32:58,618
It's epic. Bell Epic.

512
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:02,036
Belle Epoque.
The New York Times don't lie.

513
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,978
Well I never heard of it.

514
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,184
Where'd you hear about it?
The New York Times?

515
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:08,180
No, a guy from work.

516
00:33:08,192 --> 00:33:10,529
And the cinematography
is supposed to be gorgeous.

517
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:11,574
Oh. Cool.

518
00:33:39,282 --> 00:33:42,288
That's the movie you wanted to see?

519
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:44,520
There wasn't even any good sex in it.

520
00:33:44,543 --> 00:33:47,729
Had to read the whole fucking movie.
Fucking subtitled.

521
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:52,796
Some guy from a road crew recommended it
to you? A fucking subtitled movie?

522
00:33:54,694 --> 00:33:56,467
What's going on, huh?

523
00:33:56,481 --> 00:33:59,916
What's going on? You got a girlfriend
or something? You hiding me from her?

524
00:33:59,927 --> 00:34:01,533
I don't have a girlfriend, all right?

525
00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:05,343
I like you.

526
00:34:05,367 --> 00:34:08,608
I came here because
I don't want to show my face in Lowell.

527
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:11,050
I told everybody I was going to win
that fight and get back on track.

528
00:34:11,055 --> 00:34:13,779
I told my daughter I was going to get
a bigger apartment so she could move in.

529
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:15,752
You don't think I wanted to call you?

530
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:18,018
I was embarrassed.

531
00:34:18,037 --> 00:34:20,416
I'm sick of being a fucking disappointment.

532
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:28,523
You really think your family
is looking out for you?

533
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,167
Don't say that. I don't like that.

534
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:35,961
What else I can say
after what you told me?

535
00:34:37,807 --> 00:34:39,706
Look at your face.

536
00:34:40,892 --> 00:34:42,805
Look at you.

537
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:08,438
Bullshit, Lou.

538
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:13,066
I'm not going to stop calling until you
make this right and get us a fight that's fair.

539
00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:15,639
My boy could have got killed last time.

540
00:35:17,855 --> 00:35:19,734
Yeah, like what?

541
00:35:20,669 --> 00:35:23,534
Just don't tell me he just got
off the fucking couch.

542
00:35:24,868 --> 00:35:26,007
Mm-hm.

543
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:29,920
Coming off a loss?

544
00:35:30,947 --> 00:35:33,965
That sounds very interesting.
I'll get back to you.

545
00:35:33,977 --> 00:35:36,971
Got a great opportunity here.

546
00:35:36,983 --> 00:35:38,587
We've got to go find Micky.

547
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:40,593
Nobody's seen him for, like, three weeks.

548
00:35:42,384 --> 00:35:43,864
Jesus...

549
00:35:44,846 --> 00:35:47,401
Used to be Dicky we couldn't find.
Now it's both of them?

550
00:35:47,402 --> 00:35:49,621
Mom, I think he's with that girl from the bar.

551
00:35:49,629 --> 00:35:52,797
- What girl?
- It's that fucking girl, Charlene.

552
00:35:52,821 --> 00:35:55,075
That's who he's with. That girl from the bar.

553
00:35:55,087 --> 00:35:58,791
George was all fucking eager
for them to get together.

554
00:35:58,815 --> 00:36:01,351
- I heard she's into three-ways.
- Yeah, with other girls.

555
00:36:01,374 --> 00:36:03,397
Yeah, like one of those MTV girls.

556
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,663
MTV girls? What are you talking about?

557
00:36:05,675 --> 00:36:06,773
Wild.

558
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:09,708
She acts all fucking superior
because she went to college.

559
00:36:11,034 --> 00:36:13,852
You girls just go find your brother Micky.

560
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:17,293
Tell him I've got important business to discuss.

561
00:36:17,317 --> 00:36:19,239
I've got to go find Dicky.

562
00:36:28,435 --> 00:36:30,247
Dicky!

563
00:37:18,656 --> 00:37:21,744
Hey, Mom. It's not...
It's just...

564
00:37:22,801 --> 00:37:24,968
It's just a friend's house.

565
00:37:26,943 --> 00:37:28,378
Come on, whatever.

566
00:37:42,654 --> 00:37:46,434
<i>I started a joke,</i>

567
00:37:46,435 --> 00:37:51,546
<i>which started the whole world crying.</i>

568
00:37:51,558 --> 00:37:55,785
<i>Oh, if only I'd seen</i>

569
00:37:55,797 --> 00:37:59,820
<i>that the joke was on me.</i>

570
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:03,718
<i>I started to cry,</i>

571
00:38:03,742 --> 00:38:08,949
<i>which started the whole world laughing.</i>

572
00:38:08,961 --> 00:38:12,871
<i>Oh, if only I'd seen</i>

573
00:38:12,883 --> 00:38:16,348
<i>that the joke was on me.</i>

574
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:20,363
<i>I looked at the skies,</i>

575
00:38:20,378 --> 00:38:26,167
<i>running my hands over my eyes,</i>

576
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:31,851
<i>and I fell out of bed,</i>

577
00:38:31,863 --> 00:38:34,646
<i>hurting my head...</i>

578
00:38:51,036 --> 00:38:54,160
So you're Beaver,
and you're Red Bear.

579
00:38:54,171 --> 00:38:55,710
Red beard.

580
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,269
She's Red Dog, and that's Beaver.

581
00:38:58,275 --> 00:39:00,828
You're Red Dog.
You're Beaver.

582
00:39:00,851 --> 00:39:03,481
- Yeah, don't use those names.
- It's just for family.

583
00:39:03,493 --> 00:39:04,937
Be nice.

584
00:39:05,524 --> 00:39:07,497
Don't use the nicknames.

585
00:39:08,734 --> 00:39:10,970
What the fuck will I call them then?

586
00:39:11,754 --> 00:39:13,410
Speaking of family...

587
00:39:26,169 --> 00:39:27,426
Hello.

588
00:39:28,938 --> 00:39:31,267
- Alice, this is Charlene.
- Hi.

589
00:39:33,435 --> 00:39:35,595
I've heard a lot about you.

590
00:39:35,605 --> 00:39:37,331
Really? I've heard a lot about you, too.

591
00:39:37,354 --> 00:39:39,393
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Same thing you meant.

592
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,371
Can we just sit down and talk about business?

593
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:46,578
I got you another fight, Mick.
Just like I said I would.

594
00:39:47,568 --> 00:39:51,002
- Lou Gold and ESPN made it right.
- Just like I told you.

595
00:39:51,026 --> 00:39:55,253
Joe Mellenk. Six weeks. Foxwoods.

596
00:39:55,254 --> 00:39:59,012
Ten in eight. He's nothing.

597
00:39:59,035 --> 00:40:01,888
- And they're going to pay us twenty grand.
- $17,500, technically.

598
00:40:01,905 --> 00:40:06,296
$17,500, which is still good money, Mick.

599
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,201
Yeah.

600
00:40:10,544 --> 00:40:14,204
That's good, Dick. I'm just trying to
figure out what's best for me.

601
00:40:17,963 --> 00:40:19,906
Like what, huh?

602
00:40:23,827 --> 00:40:26,738
What's best for you, sweetheart?

603
00:40:26,762 --> 00:40:29,569
Come on, Mick. I thought you'd be more excited.
Why aren't you more excited?

604
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:33,491
It's a good fight, good money.
I got something with Lou Gold.

605
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:35,301
He knows us.

606
00:40:36,241 --> 00:40:39,669
I know, Mom. I just don't want things
going the way they've been going.

607
00:40:39,681 --> 00:40:43,718
Mick, that last fight was unfair.
It was unfair.

608
00:40:43,731 --> 00:40:46,608
- And we ain't going to repeat that, right?
- Oh, not on your life.

609
00:40:48,365 --> 00:40:50,866
You know, buddy,
it's just you in the ring.

610
00:40:50,878 --> 00:40:52,463
Yeah, I know it's just me in the ring.

611
00:40:52,475 --> 00:40:54,624
But I don't like the way
things have been going here.

612
00:40:54,646 --> 00:40:55,720
- Where?
- Where?

613
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,726
Here, this, us, Lowell, the whole routine.

614
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:01,566
- George, stay out of it!
- You're doing all the talking.

615
00:41:01,591 --> 00:41:04,561
- Let him talk. Listen.
- I'm asking him.

616
00:41:04,579 --> 00:41:07,631
- You're telling him. Listen.
- Stay out of it.

617
00:41:07,643 --> 00:41:09,827
Hey, don't tell me to stay out of it.

618
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,058
Mick, what's the problem?

619
00:41:13,164 --> 00:41:15,853
- Problems.
- What problems?

620
00:41:15,878 --> 00:41:18,388
- Problems...
- Like what?

621
00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:23,475
Like maybe you
not showing up on time to train.

622
00:41:23,494 --> 00:41:26,805
Like maybe him having to
come find you in a crack house

623
00:41:26,822 --> 00:41:29,982
when you're supposed to be at the airport.

624
00:41:31,987 --> 00:41:36,182
I'm sorry. I don't know who you are.
Why are you talking?

625
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:39,294
I'm Charlene. We just met.

626
00:41:39,317 --> 00:41:42,684
We're together. Do we need to do this again?
Hi, I'm Charlene.

627
00:41:42,707 --> 00:41:45,528
- Hi, Charlene.
- Hi.

628
00:41:45,529 --> 00:41:47,396
- Hi, I'm Charlene.
- Hi, Charlene.

629
00:41:47,408 --> 00:41:48,993
Hey, we're together.

630
00:41:50,279 --> 00:41:51,911
What are you going to do, Mick?

631
00:41:51,935 --> 00:41:54,471
Listen to some MTV girl who works in a bar?

632
00:41:54,486 --> 00:41:56,459
What does she know about boxing?

633
00:41:56,478 --> 00:42:01,702
I know they're going to Vegas
and getting paid to train year-round.

634
00:42:01,714 --> 00:42:04,469
Sounds a hell of a lot better than
what you've got him doing here.

635
00:42:07,798 --> 00:42:10,226
You going to let her talk like that
to your mother?

636
00:42:10,245 --> 00:42:11,595
Come on, Micky.

637
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:14,657
I told you, we're together.
This is my girlfriend. I want her here.

638
00:42:16,179 --> 00:42:20,226
I have done everything.
Everything I could for you, Micky.

639
00:42:21,558 --> 00:42:23,495
This MTV girl comes along...

640
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:26,580
Stop calling me an MTV girl,
whatever the fuck that means.

641
00:42:26,603 --> 00:42:28,467
- Skank.
- Wild.

642
00:42:30,188 --> 00:42:34,767
I've been doing this over fifteen years.
She comes in, disrespects me...

643
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:37,800
She don't mean no disrespect, okay?

644
00:42:37,812 --> 00:42:40,868
I had a chance to get paid to train year-round.

645
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,516
Year-round, okay?
That's all she's talking about.

646
00:42:43,539 --> 00:42:45,594
I would hope that you guys
could appreciate that.

647
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:48,341
I know what you're talking about, all right?
I could have had that.

648
00:42:50,136 --> 00:42:54,927
You know, I had opportunities
like maybe you're going to have.

649
00:42:55,436 --> 00:43:00,641
Now, you want money
so you can train year-round? Yeah?

650
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,336
I'll get you money
so you can train year-round.

651
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:04,506
- You?
- Yeah, I'll do it.

652
00:43:04,517 --> 00:43:05,362
- Trust me.
- How?

653
00:43:05,379 --> 00:43:07,880
Hey, trust me, all right?

654
00:43:07,899 --> 00:43:09,082
Done.

655
00:43:11,162 --> 00:43:14,344
All right? Charlene?
Yeah? Everyone?

656
00:43:20,103 --> 00:43:23,191
So you put in $200...

657
00:43:23,215 --> 00:43:25,258
Then you get ten other people
to put in $200...

658
00:43:27,148 --> 00:43:30,371
And you've got your $2000.

659
00:43:35,235 --> 00:43:38,892
- Everybody give you $200?
- No, not everybody. Just ten of you.

660
00:43:38,903 --> 00:43:40,207
Ten lucky ones.

661
00:43:44,332 --> 00:43:45,917
- You'll rip us off.
- No, no.

662
00:43:45,935 --> 00:43:48,565
- Give me another $200.
- You give me $200!

663
00:43:49,598 --> 00:43:53,331
No, you get that from ten other people
who you offer the opportunity to.

664
00:43:53,332 --> 00:43:55,809
Right? You understand? No?

665
00:44:00,494 --> 00:44:04,266
He thinks you think
Cambodian people are stupid.

666
00:44:04,289 --> 00:44:06,074
I love Cambodian people!

667
00:44:06,086 --> 00:44:09,459
I mean, look. Look at Karen.

668
00:44:09,483 --> 00:44:11,837
She's my girlfriend.
She's beautiful. I love her.

669
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:15,265
And Brian. We work on a road crew together.

670
00:44:15,283 --> 00:44:16,469
Not so much lately.

671
00:44:16,483 --> 00:44:18,584
Brian, we work on a road crew together.

672
00:44:18,608 --> 00:44:21,144
You haven't been showing up,
that's what I'm saying.

673
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,777
This isn't any kind of Cambodian thing.

674
00:44:23,778 --> 00:44:26,033
White people do this to other white people.

675
00:44:26,044 --> 00:44:28,393
- It's what makes the world go around.
- I don't think that's helping.

676
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:32,302
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity...

677
00:44:37,223 --> 00:44:42,014
I mean, they didn't understand.
They're practically on my game...

678
00:44:42,025 --> 00:44:45,454
Usually they listen to what I say,
but they just didn't understand

679
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:49,194
the opportunity. I mean, it was awesome.
What were we talking about?

680
00:44:49,203 --> 00:44:51,293
- Before you fought Sugar Ray.
- Right, right, right.

681
00:44:51,305 --> 00:44:56,260
Sugar Ray was too much, too soon.
I needed to build up slow.

682
00:44:57,845 --> 00:45:02,240
- What's this movie about again?
- I told you, it's about crack addiction.

683
00:45:02,263 --> 00:45:05,105
Showing what it really is
so kids can see it for real.

684
00:45:08,485 --> 00:45:10,352
Fuck.

685
00:45:12,524 --> 00:45:14,755
We've got to get Mick's money.

686
00:45:27,139 --> 00:45:29,299
Yeah!
That was awesome!

687
00:46:14,554 --> 00:46:17,596
- Get out of the car!
- Oh, shit!

688
00:46:19,428 --> 00:46:22,797
Put your hands on the roof!
Put your hands on the roof, that's it!

689
00:46:22,798 --> 00:46:24,489
- Empty your pockets.
- Are you a cop?

690
00:46:24,513 --> 00:46:27,741
Get on the fucking sidewalk, move!
Fucking move! Don't turn around!

691
00:46:27,759 --> 00:46:31,046
Don't turn around!
We'll have to take your vehicle.

692
00:46:31,069 --> 00:46:33,417
- How am I going to get home?
- That's your problem.

693
00:46:34,922 --> 00:46:37,071
How much we got here? Count it.

694
00:46:40,834 --> 00:46:42,565
What the fuck?

695
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:45,196
That's the guy!
He did it to me and he's doing it again!

696
00:46:45,213 --> 00:46:47,302
Get on the ground right now!

697
00:47:24,221 --> 00:47:27,368
Open the door!
I've got to get off the fucking street!

698
00:47:29,301 --> 00:47:31,471
I'm trying to get off the fucking street!

699
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:54,998
It's Dicky. The cops are fucking punching him.
They're beating him. He needs help.

700
00:47:57,299 --> 00:47:59,606
Stay here. Don't get up. Stay here.

701
00:47:59,614 --> 00:48:02,456
Listen to him. Stay right here.

702
00:48:02,467 --> 00:48:05,175
Are you fucking kidding me?

703
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:13,984
Hey what the fuck?
Come on.

704
00:48:14,001 --> 00:48:16,152
Just put him in the car.
You don't need to do that.

705
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,387
Want to get involved?
Now you're involved.

706
00:48:25,804 --> 00:48:27,741
He's a fighter.
Break his fucking hands

707
00:48:43,026 --> 00:48:46,712
Micky your hand...
Your hand...

708
00:48:51,162 --> 00:48:53,351
Separate cars, separate cells.

709
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:55,798
I don't want them making up
some bullshit defense story.

710
00:48:55,823 --> 00:48:58,476
Come on, folks, time to go home.
Let's go.

711
00:49:00,802 --> 00:49:02,751
- Hey, Dicky!
- What the fuck, man?

712
00:49:02,762 --> 00:49:05,193
- Dicky!
- Jesus Christ.

713
00:49:07,479 --> 00:49:09,310
His hands...

714
00:49:36,874 --> 00:49:40,608
Welcome back, Dicky.
That's 27 arrests.

715
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:53,852
Ward: One count of disturbing the peace,
released on your own recognizance.

716
00:49:53,876 --> 00:49:57,757
Eklund: Three counts of assault
and battery on a police officer,

717
00:49:57,777 --> 00:50:01,698
two counts of resisting arrest,
two counts of larceny from a person,

718
00:50:01,722 --> 00:50:04,129
two counts of impersonating
a police officer.

719
00:50:04,146 --> 00:50:07,258
Bail set at $25,000.

720
00:50:07,281 --> 00:50:10,038
Case continued two weeks from today.

721
00:50:11,712 --> 00:50:15,827
I'm wondering about the File 357.

722
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:18,915
I need a copy of the discovery report,
as well.

723
00:50:23,092 --> 00:50:26,026
- You're going to say it was self-defense, right?
- What?

724
00:50:26,027 --> 00:50:28,189
You're going to say it was self-defense, right?

725
00:50:28,211 --> 00:50:30,493
You came outside, you seen them beating on me.
I didn't do nothing.

726
00:50:30,505 --> 00:50:33,427
I was just waiting outside like anybody else.
Mick, I was doing it for you.

727
00:50:33,429 --> 00:50:34,943
- You did it for me?
- Yes.

728
00:50:34,967 --> 00:50:37,973
Do me a favor. Don't do fucking
nothing for me no more, okay?

729
00:50:37,986 --> 00:50:41,684
- I'm fucking done lying for you.
- What are you going to do without me, huh?

730
00:50:41,696 --> 00:50:45,136
Huh?
This ain't how it was going to go down.

731
00:50:45,154 --> 00:50:48,383
They should have just put me in the car, huh?

732
00:50:48,407 --> 00:50:51,131
Mick, come on! Mick!

733
00:51:04,231 --> 00:51:06,767
Dicky, hey! What's up, Dicky?

734
00:51:08,739 --> 00:51:11,076
Hey, that's the man!

735
00:51:11,088 --> 00:51:13,172
- Hey!
- Hey!

736
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:16,635
Hey, you knocked out Sugar Ray!

737
00:51:16,647 --> 00:51:19,570
Dicky! Dicky! Dicky!

738
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:03,014
Who is it?

739
00:52:09,788 --> 00:52:12,180
I don't want to see you, Micky.

740
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:13,601
Charlene...

741
00:52:13,613 --> 00:52:15,548
I can't take it.

742
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,448
I'm not going to let you
or your family drag me down.

743
00:52:18,472 --> 00:52:20,464
I'm quitting, Charlene, okay?

744
00:52:20,487 --> 00:52:23,375
I'm done fighting.
I don't need it anymore.

745
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:26,891
- That's fucking stupid.
- What? Why?

746
00:52:27,594 --> 00:52:31,536
Because it's sad that you let them take it
away from you with their stupid bullshit.

747
00:52:33,381 --> 00:52:35,354
What else I can do, Charlene?

748
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:38,094
There's a lot you can do, Micky.

749
00:52:38,118 --> 00:52:42,222
There's this guy that your dad wants you to meet,
you just don't think you can do it without Dicky.

750
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,218
Charlene...

751
00:52:45,392 --> 00:52:47,741
- Don't call.
- Come on.

752
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:50,925
Don't call me, okay?

753
00:52:59,747 --> 00:53:02,036
Hey, Dicky, you hurt bad?

754
00:53:04,044 --> 00:53:06,228
Poor fucker.

755
00:53:40,338 --> 00:53:42,463
Hey, Micky, bring another bucket, huh?

756
00:53:45,016 --> 00:53:45,909
Good.

757
00:53:56,741 --> 00:53:59,688
And this Friday,
an HBO original documentary.

758
00:53:59,711 --> 00:54:02,869
Right here in Lowell, Mass.,
the story of Dick Eklund,

759
00:54:02,881 --> 00:54:05,593
the once promising boxer who turned criminal.

760
00:54:19,803 --> 00:54:22,114
Oh, look who it is.

761
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:26,190
That's...
That's Dicky's brother.

762
00:54:26,214 --> 00:54:28,292
- Hey, Micky.
- Regular.

763
00:54:30,647 --> 00:54:31,727
Hey.

764
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:35,555
- Hey, what's up, man?
- Look who's here.

765
00:54:38,091 --> 00:54:40,469
- Good to see you, bro.
- How you doing?

766
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:43,252
How you feeling?
How's the hand?

767
00:54:43,276 --> 00:54:46,469
- Uh, it's getting there.
- Looks better.

768
00:54:46,481 --> 00:54:49,671
Why don't you come down to the gym?
We'll work out, if you want.

769
00:54:49,683 --> 00:54:53,642
- You fat fuck, you're getting big.
- Yeah, I know. It's just...

770
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:56,166
Roofing for my father and
spending more time with Kasie.

771
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:58,327
By the way, this movie on HBO, man.

772
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:00,757
What are you boys looking at?

773
00:55:00,768 --> 00:55:03,177
The movie's not about him.
It's about his crazy brother.

774
00:55:03,193 --> 00:55:04,449
I should go.

775
00:55:05,283 --> 00:55:08,143
- Come back to the gym, Mick.
- Bye, Mick.

776
00:55:08,154 --> 00:55:11,064
Don't go watch that crazy shit on TV.
Don't.

777
00:55:23,552 --> 00:55:25,251
Going to Hollywood...

778
00:55:42,125 --> 00:55:45,273
Let's get this started!

779
00:55:57,115 --> 00:56:00,426
Lowell was the birthplace of
the Industrial Revolution in America.

780
00:56:00,449 --> 00:56:05,101
- Oh, that's...
- These people came to find...

781
00:56:05,125 --> 00:56:08,401
I used to live over there.
This town's got good memories, right?

782
00:56:08,413 --> 00:56:10,092
- Check it out.
- Fuck yeah.

783
00:56:10,109 --> 00:56:12,317
This house right up this way,
the white house...

784
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:16,118
- Oh, yeah!
- First time I got my crack over here.

785
00:56:16,142 --> 00:56:18,455
Did you ever know they
smoke crack at the white house?

786
00:56:22,057 --> 00:56:24,629
The first time I did crack or whatever,
I was about twenty-three.

787
00:56:24,646 --> 00:56:28,004
A friend of mine gave me a gram or whatever.
Fuck I wish that never happened.

788
00:56:28,028 --> 00:56:32,050
Before that,
I'd be doing the silver mittens and stuff.

789
00:56:32,061 --> 00:56:35,948
I was the only kid.
I'd be twelve. I'm shit-faced.

790
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,451
I'll tell you how crack was.

791
00:56:39,435 --> 00:56:43,732
It enters your lungs.
When it enters your lungs,

792
00:56:43,756 --> 00:56:46,580
- I want to watch Daddy.
- Oh, my God.

793
00:56:46,604 --> 00:56:50,788
- No, sweetie. You go back upstairs.
- But I want to watch Daddy on TV.

794
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,168
No, you can't.
You can't watch Daddy now, all right?

795
00:56:54,169 --> 00:56:56,576
You go back upstairs and go to bed, okay?

796
00:56:56,593 --> 00:56:59,012
Okay, this is my boy, here. Check it out.

797
00:56:59,024 --> 00:57:01,058
What... What can I sell you today?
A python?

798
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:04,546
Yeah, check it out, man.
They're going to buy me some.

799
00:57:07,445 --> 00:57:11,555
It's been a while.
I'll take anything right now.

800
00:57:11,566 --> 00:57:17,019
Never thought I'd kiss a fucking snake.
I always dreamed about it, but...

801
00:57:17,031 --> 00:57:20,833
You do a lot of shit when you're high, right?

802
00:57:22,265 --> 00:57:25,259
Heck, yeah.
Put it all on the map.

803
00:57:25,271 --> 00:57:28,454
You knocked Sugar Ray Leonard down,
didn't you say?

804
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:32,536
Yeah, he knocked him down,
but I don't think it was a knockout.

805
00:57:32,548 --> 00:57:35,330
- I think he slipped.
- He knocked him down.

806
00:57:35,342 --> 00:57:37,850
- He didn't slip.
- He slipped.

807
00:57:37,862 --> 00:57:40,479
- Oh, Jack...
- Come on.

808
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,995
That's a fucking lie!

809
00:57:42,012 --> 00:57:44,067
They say he's in trouble with drugs...

810
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:46,747
What are you doing?
Are you talking shit about the family?

811
00:57:46,759 --> 00:57:48,790
- No, not at all.
- Yeah. I heard you say.

812
00:57:48,814 --> 00:57:52,195
We're not like that.
This is not what Lowell is all about.

813
00:57:52,207 --> 00:57:55,612
I thought he could make a comeback
and make us proud, but he didn't.

814
00:57:55,623 --> 00:57:58,641
- I don't know what Dicky was thinking.
- Very disappointing.

815
00:57:58,653 --> 00:58:02,639
You brought the city of Lowell
back thirty years. We're not happy.

816
00:58:02,651 --> 00:58:04,365
- Hello?
- Jimmy.

817
00:58:04,389 --> 00:58:07,183
Hey, will you do me a favor?
Make sure Kasie's not watching HBO?

818
00:58:07,195 --> 00:58:08,986
Actually, we were watching it right now, Mick,

819
00:58:08,987 --> 00:58:11,863
but don't worry about it.
I got it...

820
00:58:11,886 --> 00:58:13,601
I want her to see it.

821
00:58:13,612 --> 00:58:15,104
Let her see who her uncle is.

822
00:58:15,127 --> 00:58:16,618
- What?
- Who you are.

823
00:58:16,642 --> 00:58:18,895
Who I am?
What are you talking about?

824
00:58:18,918 --> 00:58:22,229
- Kids need to know the truth, Mick.
- Laurie, turn it off, please.

825
00:58:22,241 --> 00:58:25,704
She does not need to see this.
She doesn't need to see it. She's a kid.

826
00:58:26,772 --> 00:58:29,359
If you're on crack,

827
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,988
you feel so much lighter.

828
00:58:33,012 --> 00:58:36,194
You know, you feel young.
And everything is so funny.

829
00:58:36,206 --> 00:58:42,527
Everything is just...
Everything is...

830
00:58:42,551 --> 00:58:43,850
It wasn't funny.

831
00:58:48,547 --> 00:58:51,554
And then it fades,
then you've got to get high again.

832
00:58:56,604 --> 00:59:00,641
Your part of the movie's going to end
with you going to jail.

833
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:05,890
We know Dicky.
We're going to take care of him, huh?

834
00:59:09,048 --> 00:59:10,610
You guys can't talk to him.

835
00:59:15,204 --> 00:59:17,580
Turn that shit off.
Turn this off, all right?

836
00:59:17,592 --> 00:59:19,798
Turn it off.
Will you turn this off?

837
00:59:19,799 --> 00:59:21,936
I'm turning it fucking off.

838
00:59:26,346 --> 00:59:29,340
Hey, that's my life.
That's my fucking life up there.

839
00:59:29,351 --> 00:59:32,181
- I want to watch this.
- I don't care. I will fuck you up.

840
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:35,617
You fucking want some?
Don't fucking try me.

841
00:59:35,641 --> 00:59:38,811
I still fucking won it, okay?
You fucking want some?

842
00:59:39,674 --> 00:59:42,339
That's my son there.
You're laughing at him?

843
00:59:44,006 --> 00:59:48,941
That's my son, he's crying, he needs me,
and I'm fucking stuck in here?

844
00:59:52,106 --> 00:59:54,736
Micky, are you watching this?

845
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,749
What are they doing to us?

846
00:59:58,614 --> 01:00:01,726
I don't know what to tell you.

847
01:00:01,749 --> 01:00:05,392
You're pretending like you don't know what's going on.
He's been doing this for years.

848
01:00:06,691 --> 01:00:08,985
Yeah, I know it's horrible, Mom.

849
01:00:13,954 --> 01:00:15,480
What do you think?

850
01:00:15,502 --> 01:00:18,790
- You think they set him up?
- Mom, what do you think he was doing?

851
01:00:18,802 --> 01:00:22,277
You know, they gave him money,
gave him drugs for the movie, right?

852
01:00:25,719 --> 01:00:26,917
Micky?

853
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:50,013
- You got a new bag, huh?
- Yup.

854
01:02:50,036 --> 01:02:52,584
- New bracket, too?
- Yup.

855
01:02:52,605 --> 01:02:54,038
- What happened to the peanut?
- Don't know.

856
01:02:55,928 --> 01:02:57,563
Like a beach ball.

857
01:04:23,304 --> 01:04:24,631
Good job.

858
01:04:25,816 --> 01:04:28,957
- Mick, Sal Lanano.
- Hey, Mick. How you doing?

859
01:04:28,959 --> 01:04:32,341
- You own the cab company. Good businessman, right?
- He's very organized.

860
01:04:32,353 --> 01:04:34,748
- How's the hand?
- It's good, you know?

861
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:37,037
It's getting better. Stronger.

862
01:04:37,062 --> 01:04:40,667
You know, I made a few calls already.
I just talked to Buddy Tags.

863
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:45,326
He said he can set up something local.
You know, something to start back with.

864
01:04:45,337 --> 01:04:48,003
- Get your confidence back.
- That's it. You've got to get your confidence back.

865
01:04:48,026 --> 01:04:49,682
That's all.

866
01:04:50,997 --> 01:04:53,576
Your dad wants Sal to manage you,

867
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,549
and he wants me to train you,

868
01:04:55,572 --> 01:04:58,202
but he'll only do it on one condition.

869
01:05:00,269 --> 01:05:04,152
- No crazy time nonsense.
- That's how it's got to be.

870
01:05:04,163 --> 01:05:08,065
- No Dicky, no Alice.
- No Dicky, no Alice.

871
01:05:08,076 --> 01:05:11,740
I get it. I get it. I'm good. I understand.
Look, I appreciate the opportunity.

872
01:05:11,764 --> 01:05:14,690
Can't take the bullshit, Mick.
No offense, George.

873
01:05:14,696 --> 01:05:19,213
None taken. I mean, I'm going to be
the one that gets his balls cut off anyway.

874
01:05:20,427 --> 01:05:22,330
Yeah, you laugh.

875
01:05:22,341 --> 01:05:25,617
- You traitor!
- What are you doing?

876
01:05:26,914 --> 01:05:29,133
What the hell's the matter with you?

877
01:05:31,078 --> 01:05:32,887
Did that hurt? I hope it hurt!

878
01:05:32,909 --> 01:05:35,676
- Sal Lanano is a good man!
- A good man?

879
01:05:35,688 --> 01:05:38,905
- He's a legitimate businessman!
- Legitimate businessman?

880
01:05:38,919 --> 01:05:41,667
- What?
- Oh, my God, you know what that sounds like?

881
01:05:41,678 --> 01:05:44,332
- He's a crook, George!
- He owns a taxicab company!

882
01:05:44,355 --> 01:05:46,668
- He's organized!
- Oh, my God, he's a cab driver.

883
01:05:46,685 --> 01:05:48,998
- He knows everything about boxing, right?
- Yes.

884
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:53,002
I don't think so! I think he's going to
steal your son's money and rob him blind!

885
01:05:53,026 --> 01:05:55,785
Why would you think that?
Why would you even think that?

886
01:05:55,802 --> 01:05:58,392
- Why can't you trust anybody?
- I know people.

887
01:05:58,416 --> 01:06:01,024
I know, George. You think I don't
know anything. But I know people.

888
01:06:01,038 --> 01:06:05,054
- I know you know things...
- And that Sal Lanana banana fucking thing...

889
01:06:05,078 --> 01:06:08,776
- We don't need that in our lives!
- We haven't made one dollar with these kids.

890
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,687
- You betrayed me. You betrayed me.
- Oh, bullshit, I betrayed you.

891
01:06:11,699 --> 01:06:14,012
- You're always have to say...
- He's a fucking crook!

892
01:06:14,028 --> 01:06:16,952
What's Micky supposed to do?
Dicky's in jail.

893
01:06:16,975 --> 01:06:22,897
We're not talking about his trainer, sweetheart.
We're talking about his manager, that's me!

894
01:06:22,919 --> 01:06:25,339
Yeah, but Mom, maybe Micky should
try something different...

895
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:27,487
What are you doing,
opening your mouth in my kitchen?

896
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:29,847
You owe me $200.

897
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:31,521
I said I was going to pay you next week.

898
01:06:31,545 --> 01:06:35,149
I don't want another word out of you.
That was last month you told me two weeks.

899
01:06:35,169 --> 01:06:38,445
Do you take sides against me in my own house?
You owe me money?

900
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:40,351
Mom's been great to Micky, Sherri.

901
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:43,416
Really, who's going to look after Micky
better than his own mother?

902
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:46,790
It's that fucking girl, Charlene.
We've got to get rid of her, Mom.

903
01:06:46,814 --> 01:06:49,444
We've got to get rid of her.
It's that girl, Charlene. She's got to go.

904
01:06:49,467 --> 01:06:53,019
You're going to get Charlene involved in this?
Is that what you're all telling me?

905
01:06:53,032 --> 01:06:54,652
- Huh?
- I know where she lives.

906
01:06:54,664 --> 01:06:56,167
What are you picking on her for?

907
01:06:56,184 --> 01:06:59,166
- She lives in that yellow house on Steven Street.
- Yeah, the puke yellow.

908
01:06:59,178 --> 01:07:01,972
I'm going to talk to Micky.
Sort this out for myself.

909
01:07:01,996 --> 01:07:08,536
Yeah, sure. You go handle it with
your vigilantes. This is wrong, Alice!

910
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:18,525
- I got it.
- Get out of my way!

911
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:24,298
Get in the car.

912
01:07:46,878 --> 01:07:48,377
Micky, are you in there?

913
01:07:48,381 --> 01:07:50,192
Up in there on the second floor.

914
01:07:50,201 --> 01:07:51,330
Micky!

915
01:07:52,277 --> 01:07:54,332
Where the hell are you, huh?

916
01:07:54,356 --> 01:07:56,316
Are you up there? Come on down.

917
01:07:56,328 --> 01:07:58,301
Where are you?

918
01:07:59,099 --> 01:08:01,797
Holy shit, Micky.
Your mother and your sisters are here.

919
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:05,049
No, no.
Do not go out there, please.

920
01:08:05,054 --> 01:08:08,272
No, I'm not hiding
from your crazy fucking family.

921
01:08:20,342 --> 01:08:21,254
Hi.

922
01:08:21,258 --> 01:08:23,477
Well, well, well. Look at this.

923
01:08:23,489 --> 01:08:24,823
Look at what?

924
01:08:25,729 --> 01:08:28,101
Why are you hiding from us, Micky?

925
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:29,889
- He's not hiding.
- I wasn't talking to you.

926
01:08:29,912 --> 01:08:31,673
I was talking to my son.

927
01:08:31,688 --> 01:08:35,738
- What are you doing next to her?
- I'm right here. I ain't hiding from nobody, Alice.

928
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:39,352
Well you're not helping yourself with
your father's scumbag friend, Lanano.

929
01:08:39,374 --> 01:08:42,239
What are you going to do?
Turn your back on Dicky next, huh?

930
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,518
All we ever wanted for you
was to be world champion.

931
01:08:46,542 --> 01:08:49,348
Micky's a grown man.
He can think for himself.

932
01:08:49,371 --> 01:08:51,767
- Shut your mouth.
- Skank!

933
01:08:51,786 --> 01:08:55,438
Don't call me skank. I'll rip that
nasty hair right out of your fucking head.

934
01:08:55,448 --> 01:08:59,053
- I'm his mother and his manager.
- You're not my manager anymore.

935
01:08:59,065 --> 01:09:02,619
And I'm not waiting for Dicky, okay?
I'm not getting any younger.

936
01:09:02,631 --> 01:09:05,543
- Who's going to look after you, sweetheart?
- How about me?

937
01:09:05,566 --> 01:09:08,082
I know you don't understand it
but I had nine kids,

938
01:09:08,106 --> 01:09:10,066
and I love every one of you the same.

939
01:09:10,082 --> 01:09:12,149
You've got a funny way of showing it,
letting him get beat up,

940
01:09:12,173 --> 01:09:15,307
- letting him get his hand broken.
- You're crazy.

941
01:09:15,695 --> 01:09:18,351
What did I just say to you?

942
01:09:24,559 --> 01:09:25,491
Let go!

943
01:09:33,101 --> 01:09:33,999
Fuck!

944
01:09:35,137 --> 01:09:37,002
Get the fuck out of here! Now!

945
01:09:37,739 --> 01:09:39,291
Fuck you, Charlene!

946
01:09:39,303 --> 01:09:41,366
- Skank!
- I want them the fuck out of here.

947
01:09:41,743 --> 01:09:45,136
- You're fucking dead.
- Fucking bitch!

948
01:09:45,846 --> 01:09:48,980
Gail! Oh, my God.
What did she do to your nose?

949
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:52,377
Let's get the hell out of here.

950
01:09:57,628 --> 01:10:01,045
What's happening to everybody?
I don't understand, sweetheart.

951
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:51,804
Why do you think I spell my name with an "E"?
Because I don't.

952
01:10:51,816 --> 01:10:54,611
- "No E" Micky Ward.
- Hey, somebody push that.

953
01:10:55,952 --> 01:10:58,688
- Where are we going?
- To the ring. The ring's across the street.

954
01:10:58,712 --> 01:11:00,825
- The ring's across the street?
- Yeah.

955
01:11:00,849 --> 01:11:03,415
Smaller venue. They've got
no dressing rooms over there.

956
01:11:03,435 --> 01:11:05,415
It's a starter, Micky.

957
01:11:09,652 --> 01:11:10,650
Hey.

958
01:11:11,883 --> 01:11:13,101
Good luck.

959
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,237
That's it. That's it.

960
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:30,914
Yeah!

961
01:11:35,296 --> 01:11:37,219
Yeah!

962
01:12:58,469 --> 01:13:00,664
Visit for Dick Eklund.

963
01:13:00,688 --> 01:13:02,238
Dicky!

964
01:13:05,633 --> 01:13:08,544
Heard you won a bunch of fights, Mick.
That's good.

965
01:13:10,014 --> 01:13:14,112
I know you know what I'm doing.
I'm sure Alice and everybody else told you.

966
01:13:14,779 --> 01:13:17,576
I just wanted to tell you to your face myself.

967
01:13:17,599 --> 01:13:20,760
I've got a new manager and
Mickey O'Keefe's my trainer now.

968
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:22,396
It's going good.

969
01:13:23,394 --> 01:13:26,704
Yeah. They've got you fighting Alfonso Sanchez.

970
01:13:26,728 --> 01:13:28,830
- On HBO.
- Bet you're proud of that.

971
01:13:28,847 --> 01:13:32,206
- Fucking right.
- HBO is the best at the Mexican fight. Wake up.

972
01:13:32,229 --> 01:13:35,516
I didn't think they were
going to be invested in me.

973
01:13:35,537 --> 01:13:38,132
- I've got a shot. I'm going to take it.
- Wake up.

974
01:13:38,146 --> 01:13:40,389
They don't care if it kills you.

975
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:42,947
Mike Toma did it. He's using you.

976
01:13:42,958 --> 01:13:45,185
Like a stepping stone for Sanchez.

977
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:49,957
- Why don't you see?
- Oh, I see.

978
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:53,812
How could I stand a chance without
the great Dick Eklund in my corner, right?

979
01:13:53,836 --> 01:13:56,428
You didn't give a fuck if I got
killed by Mungin,

980
01:13:56,447 --> 01:13:58,725
now, all of the sudden, you're worried
Sanchez is going to hurt me?

981
01:13:58,740 --> 01:13:59,832
Why?

982
01:13:59,855 --> 01:14:03,014
Come on, Dick. Because you're stuck in here
and can't be the center of attention no more?

983
01:14:03,031 --> 01:14:05,268
- You need it that bad?
- It's a Mexican fight.

984
01:14:05,288 --> 01:14:08,129
He fights you,
hits like a fucking mule, all right?

985
01:14:08,138 --> 01:14:10,344
Fifteen counts undefeated. You crazy?

986
01:14:10,345 --> 01:14:13,174
And that taxicab idiot, Lanano?
He went right for it.

987
01:14:13,191 --> 01:14:15,922
He's a paper gangster.
He's using you to steal money.

988
01:14:15,936 --> 01:14:18,666
Why can't you just shut up
and be happy for me?

989
01:14:19,253 --> 01:14:22,451
I've spent the last ten years of my life
in bad fights set up by you and Alice.

990
01:14:22,472 --> 01:14:26,926
I've finally got a good thing going for me,
and you can't be fucking happy for me? Why?

991
01:14:28,264 --> 01:14:30,366
What's your plan?
How are you going to fight Sanchez?

992
01:14:30,378 --> 01:14:32,315
I ain't going to talk about that.

993
01:14:32,331 --> 01:14:33,961
What's your plan?

994
01:14:34,431 --> 01:14:38,118
- I'm not here to talk about that.
- Bullshit. Yes you are.

995
01:14:39,246 --> 01:14:41,267
You watch the fight and you'll see the plan.

996
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:44,719
I can't watch it. They don't let us.
It's too fucking violent, you know?

997
01:14:44,742 --> 01:14:45,958
Two minutes, Dicky.

998
01:14:45,973 --> 01:14:52,689
They let us watch a stupid documentary about crack,
but I can't watch my own brother fighting.

999
01:14:52,693 --> 01:14:55,945
Hey, Mick. What is it?

1000
01:14:56,744 --> 01:15:01,200
You scared? You embarrassed because you don't
even have a plan? I'm your brother. Just tell me.

1001
01:15:01,211 --> 01:15:04,712
- You're going to shit on it no matter what I say.
- I'm not going to shit on it. Just tell me.

1002
01:15:07,957 --> 01:15:12,079
Go toe-to-toe, overhand right in middle rounds.
He's weak against overhand right.

1003
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:17,785
- Who came up with that? Fatty fuck O'Keefe?
- Fuck you, Dicky.

1004
01:15:17,797 --> 01:15:20,662
You've got to run against this guy.
Let him burn himself out.

1005
01:15:20,673 --> 01:15:23,138
Take it to the body, right?
Get inside, switch stances

1006
01:15:23,162 --> 01:15:25,939
like you're going to work his right.
Hit him on the left.

1007
01:15:25,963 --> 01:15:28,288
You ain't me.
Okay, you can't be me.

1008
01:15:28,311 --> 01:15:31,352
You had a hard enough time being you
when you had your fucking chance,

1009
01:15:31,372 --> 01:15:33,297
and that's why you're in here, all right?

1010
01:15:33,321 --> 01:15:34,859
I'll fight Sanchez the way I fight.

1011
01:15:34,868 --> 01:15:37,474
I'm talking about the way you fight,
you moron!

1012
01:15:38,766 --> 01:15:41,584
- You know I'm right. He knows I'm right.
- All right.

1013
01:15:45,068 --> 01:15:46,865
Blow to the right.

1014
01:15:49,788 --> 01:15:54,508
Ward just in.
29 wins, 7 losses so far.

1015
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:59,342
Twenty KOs. He's been a little better
since he refocused himself on the sport,

1016
01:15:59,350 --> 01:16:00,900
as J.B. pointed out.

1017
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:09,066
Now here's Ward's opponent, Alfonso Sanchez,

1018
01:16:09,089 --> 01:16:14,241
out of Tijuana, Mexico.
See the record, 16 wins, 15 KOs,

1019
01:16:14,252 --> 01:16:16,089
8 first-round KOs.

1020
01:16:16,101 --> 01:16:20,187
There's Mike Toma, the promoter of the fight,
who has a lot invested in Sanchez.

1021
01:16:20,202 --> 01:16:24,045
He says that Sanchez is one of the most
talented young prospects

1022
01:16:24,057 --> 01:16:25,841
in the sport of boxing.

1023
01:16:34,997 --> 01:16:40,915
This is really one of the saddest
kinds of fights in boxing.

1024
01:16:40,938 --> 01:16:45,120
Micky Ward is 31 years old.
He's here because he needs the money.

1025
01:16:45,132 --> 01:16:47,420
- He's taking a beating.
- My point is that

1026
01:16:47,432 --> 01:16:49,710
he doesn't really have to sit here
and take this beating.

1027
01:16:49,722 --> 01:16:52,247
- He can do something about it.
- Which is what?

1028
01:16:52,271 --> 01:16:54,854
- Have his corner throw in the towel?
- Or fight back.

1029
01:16:58,057 --> 01:17:01,145
You can see his power.
Every time he hits Ward, he backs him up.

1030
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:08,340
- Unless the referee thinks he can't...
- The referee should just stop this fight.

1031
01:17:08,352 --> 01:17:10,477
We know that Micky doesn't want to be here.

1032
01:17:10,494 --> 01:17:13,288
- I wouldn't make the crowd...
- No, he's fighting scared, Dick.

1033
01:17:14,438 --> 01:17:16,493
Running away, not hitting back.

1034
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:20,006
Oh, Jesus. He's going to get hurt.

1035
01:17:20,017 --> 01:17:24,762
Doing the same old shit.
Never seen such an embarrassing performance.

1036
01:17:24,784 --> 01:17:26,839
He's doing what I told him, Mom.
He's doing what I told him.

1037
01:17:26,851 --> 01:17:28,694
Don't worry about it.
He's doing what I told him.

1038
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:31,576
Micky Ward showing nothing but respect.

1039
01:17:31,594 --> 01:17:33,508
What are you running around for?
Stop running around.

1040
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,733
Shut the fuck up, Sal.
Shut the fuck up!

1041
01:17:36,743 --> 01:17:39,596
I don't know what you're doing, Micky.
You want to fucking tell me?

1042
01:17:39,608 --> 01:17:41,991
Because I don't know what you're doing.
We'd have lost all five rounds.

1043
01:17:42,008 --> 01:17:43,946
Is that what you want?

1044
01:17:43,963 --> 01:17:46,042
This is dreadful, dreadful stuff.

1045
01:17:46,065 --> 01:17:48,419
You've got to show me something soon,
Mick, or I'm going to stop the fight.

1046
01:17:48,436 --> 01:17:49,927
They're going to stop the fight, Micky.

1047
01:17:49,936 --> 01:17:51,838
He's got to go inside, Mom.

1048
01:17:51,851 --> 01:17:54,864
He's got to take it to the body.
He's got it.

1049
01:17:54,865 --> 01:17:57,824
- Don't stop the fight.
- They're going to stop this fight.

1050
01:17:57,835 --> 01:18:00,418
You've got to do something, baby.
You've got to do something.

1051
01:18:00,433 --> 01:18:03,944
Try what we talked about, Micky.
We had a plan, and you're not doing it.

1052
01:18:03,961 --> 01:18:05,947
- Let's go.
- All right, Micky.

1053
01:18:05,959 --> 01:18:10,491
You've lost the first five rounds,
what's the next strategy going to be?

1054
01:18:10,515 --> 01:18:13,876
Double right hand by Sanchez,
then a triple left hook.

1055
01:18:13,877 --> 01:18:18,089
Couple of the left hooks landed flush
on the cheek of Micky Ward.

1056
01:18:18,101 --> 01:18:20,283
Ward tying Sanchez up.

1057
01:18:20,296 --> 01:18:23,396
Very curious performance by Micky Ward.

1058
01:18:23,419 --> 01:18:28,859
Ward seems to be trying to land one big shot
to either change Sanchez's mind...

1059
01:18:28,879 --> 01:18:33,388
And he's beginning to open up, taking
advantage of opportunities to get close to Ward

1060
01:18:33,411 --> 01:18:39,164
and throw against a fighter who is
not defending himself by punching.

1061
01:18:39,184 --> 01:18:42,012
Sanchez is going to try to end this fight.

1062
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:49,818
What are you doing? Come on.

1063
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:52,587
Come on!

1064
01:18:53,532 --> 01:18:56,033
He's down on an uppercut.

1065
01:18:58,961 --> 01:19:01,759
Nicely thrown left uppercut inside.

1066
01:19:01,769 --> 01:19:05,961
Very good. And right after Ward
threw a pretty good right hand.

1067
01:19:05,979 --> 01:19:07,223
Mick, you all right?

1068
01:19:09,272 --> 01:19:12,255
This is a fight that should be stopped.

1069
01:19:12,266 --> 01:19:15,254
- Come on, head, body, head.
- Ugh.

1070
01:19:16,801 --> 01:19:21,192
- This is not professional.
- That's exactly what I'm saying.

1071
01:19:21,203 --> 01:19:23,305
I sure wish they paid me to watch this.

1072
01:19:24,425 --> 01:19:27,177
Come on, Mick!
Head, body, head.

1073
01:19:28,443 --> 01:19:31,273
That was a good body shot by Ward.

1074
01:19:31,287 --> 01:19:34,910
- Maybe he'll turn it around.
- I'm talking about his body shot.

1075
01:19:36,186 --> 01:19:38,838
Sanchez dropped by that shot!
Oh, my God!

1076
01:19:38,851 --> 01:19:40,454
What a punch!

1077
01:19:40,466 --> 01:19:43,216
The most unlikely knockout
you have ever seen!

1078
01:19:43,228 --> 01:19:45,082
That is a kidney shot,

1079
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:48,769
The kind of kidney shot that's not as severe...

1080
01:19:48,783 --> 01:19:50,232
Yeah!

1081
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:53,920
I still don't believe what I just saw!

1082
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:58,002
Micky! Micky! Micky!

1083
01:19:58,014 --> 01:19:59,587
Micky won!

1084
01:20:01,483 --> 01:20:06,508
Now did Micky Ward just make idiots of us all
with a spectacular piece of strategy?

1085
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:08,987
- Take another look.
- Amazing.

1086
01:20:08,998 --> 01:20:11,288
A big win in the career of Micky Ward
of Lowell, Mass.

1087
01:20:11,305 --> 01:20:14,851
Unbelievable defeat at the hands of Micky Ward,

1088
01:20:14,868 --> 01:20:19,295
who had all but given away the first
half dozen rounds in the bout.

1089
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:23,302
I think what Micky did was he recognized
that he'd hurt the guy with the body shot.

1090
01:20:23,325 --> 01:20:26,472
Micky's a better fighter than that
to not be running from that guy like that.

1091
01:20:26,495 --> 01:20:28,679
Theater of the unexpected.

1092
01:20:28,702 --> 01:20:31,427
Hey, you never know
what can happen, right?

1093
01:20:31,450 --> 01:20:33,558
Never give up in this game, right?
Never give up.

1094
01:20:33,583 --> 01:20:35,239
You can't make it up, folks.

1095
01:20:35,256 --> 01:20:38,731
You know what Micky just said?
He said you can't give up in this game.

1096
01:20:38,732 --> 01:20:42,090
Well maybe Micky Ward heard me say
he should stop this fight,

1097
01:20:42,102 --> 01:20:45,319
- and he went out and stopped it.
- Yeah.

1098
01:20:45,649 --> 01:20:46,976
I can't believe it.

1099
01:20:46,988 --> 01:20:50,129
I'm looking over and I'm thinking
to myself like they were thinking:

1100
01:20:50,135 --> 01:20:51,368
This thing is over.

1101
01:20:51,392 --> 01:20:53,482
But I tell you what.
Even look at the commentators.

1102
01:20:53,493 --> 01:20:56,898
They started to take their headsets off
before he was even counted out.

1103
01:20:56,922 --> 01:20:59,235
- They just wanted to get out of there.
- Mick. Mick...

1104
01:20:59,241 --> 01:21:02,399
I just spoke to Mike Toma again and
he just told me something very interesting.

1105
01:21:02,411 --> 01:21:07,374
He just told me, had Sanchez won tonight,
he would have gotten the title shot.

1106
01:21:07,375 --> 01:21:10,493
- Holy Christ, that's beautiful.
- Why? Why is that beautiful?

1107
01:21:10,516 --> 01:21:15,284
- A title shot.
- Micky gets the shot.

1108
01:21:15,309 --> 01:21:17,939
- Are you sure about that?
- You've got to be very clear about this,

1109
01:21:17,951 --> 01:21:20,206
- because this is my kid's future.
- I just spoke to the guy.

1110
01:21:20,217 --> 01:21:23,681
- Mike, come here. Look, tell these guys.
- Hey. Congratulations.

1111
01:21:23,687 --> 01:21:25,589
- Thank you.
- Not a stepping stone anymore.

1112
01:21:25,602 --> 01:21:28,209
I always knew you had the talent.
That was a hell of a strategy,

1113
01:21:28,232 --> 01:21:30,781
wearing him down like that
and taking it to the body.

1114
01:21:30,804 --> 01:21:33,453
Thirty years in the business,
I've never seen a knockout like that.

1115
01:21:33,457 --> 01:21:36,933
Larry Merchant was writing your obituary
and Sanchez drops like he was shot with a gun.

1116
01:21:36,938 --> 01:21:38,460
Where did you get that?

1117
01:21:38,472 --> 01:21:41,666
That's the first thing my brother taught me.
Tap them to the head, dig into the body.

1118
01:21:41,681 --> 01:21:43,689
- That's a hell of a body shot.
- Thank you.

1119
01:21:43,696 --> 01:21:45,082
You ready for a title shot?

1120
01:21:45,107 --> 01:21:47,890
- Yes!
- Yes!

1121
01:21:47,908 --> 01:21:51,536
- That's what I was talking about.
- He's ready. You're ready, aren't you?

1122
01:21:51,542 --> 01:21:55,181
Shea Neary in London for the title!

1123
01:21:55,205 --> 01:21:57,506
Are you kidding me?
We've got some celebrating to do.

1124
01:21:57,517 --> 01:21:59,455
- Yeah, I think so.
- Thank you so much.

1125
01:21:59,478 --> 01:22:01,963
You're going to have
a great champion, my boy.

1126
01:22:04,011 --> 01:22:06,359
It's what your brother
would have always wanted.

1127
01:22:06,383 --> 01:22:07,991
He's not even going to be there.

1128
01:22:34,129 --> 01:22:37,358
- Hey!
- Daddy!

1129
01:22:37,372 --> 01:22:39,580
- Hey there, buddy.
- Daddy, Daddy!

1130
01:22:40,688 --> 01:22:43,988
Good to see you! Oh!

1131
01:22:44,006 --> 01:22:48,198
That's a good hug!
That's a good hug! Oh yeah!

1132
01:22:48,204 --> 01:22:50,529
- Sweetheart!
- Hi, Mom.

1133
01:22:50,552 --> 01:22:53,112
Oh, you look so good.

1134
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:54,673
Oh, my God.

1135
01:23:03,406 --> 01:23:06,399
- You have clean teeth.
- I do! Look at my teeth!

1136
01:23:06,411 --> 01:23:08,630
I got new teeth. Everything.

1137
01:23:08,647 --> 01:23:10,115
How do you think I look?

1138
01:23:10,127 --> 01:23:11,489
- Good.
- Yeah?

1139
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:25,308
- Are you going to carry me?
- No.

1140
01:23:25,331 --> 01:23:28,208
And more cake. Ice cream...

1141
01:23:28,232 --> 01:23:32,294
- Ice cream with cake.
- Ice cream with cake and cake and cake.

1142
01:23:32,635 --> 01:23:35,987
Ice cream, cake and cake.
Ice cream, cake and cake.

1143
01:23:36,002 --> 01:23:37,129
Quacker!

1144
01:23:42,878 --> 01:23:43,852
Mom.

1145
01:23:57,302 --> 01:23:59,885
- They gave you some new teeth, huh?
- Yeah.

1146
01:24:04,779 --> 01:24:08,114
- Hey, George. They let you out of the house now?
- Ha, yeah.

1147
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:11,941
- Run him out of the house, Mom?
- Hey, look. I want you to meet Sal Lanano.

1148
01:24:18,535 --> 01:24:20,313
How you doing, Dicky?

1149
01:24:22,664 --> 01:24:24,449
Let's spar, huh?

1150
01:24:32,364 --> 01:24:33,479
Hi, Charlene.

1151
01:24:59,626 --> 01:25:02,843
- Welcome back!
- Shh! It's supposed to be a surprise!

1152
01:25:02,866 --> 01:25:04,816
I'm running late.

1153
01:25:04,827 --> 01:25:07,093
- Hey.
- Hey.

1154
01:25:07,108 --> 01:25:10,725
Mick, I can't even tell you.
Being back in this smelly-ass locker room...

1155
01:25:10,736 --> 01:25:13,496
Getting back with you is what got me through.

1156
01:25:13,503 --> 01:25:15,323
You look good. Your eyes are clear.

1157
01:25:15,346 --> 01:25:17,871
- Yeah?
- You know...

1158
01:25:18,994 --> 01:25:21,772
Alice says prison might have been
the best thing for me.

1159
01:25:21,788 --> 01:25:25,111
It got me clean. Got me clear up here.

1160
01:25:26,567 --> 01:25:28,353
It's a beautiful thing, Dick.

1161
01:25:29,923 --> 01:25:31,925
I've got to talk to you about something.

1162
01:25:32,776 --> 01:25:33,563
Yeah.

1163
01:25:36,344 --> 01:25:38,387
The old locker, huh?

1164
01:25:41,406 --> 01:25:44,165
I made a promise to them
I wouldn't work with you again.

1165
01:25:52,954 --> 01:25:53,940
Huh?

1166
01:25:54,738 --> 01:25:58,012
I had to, after everything that happened.
I'm sorry.

1167
01:26:03,334 --> 01:26:05,156
You sticking to that?

1168
01:26:07,294 --> 01:26:09,067
I'm glad you're back.

1169
01:26:09,595 --> 01:26:10,887
You look good.

1170
01:26:12,038 --> 01:26:14,093
I don't know what else to say.

1171
01:26:21,872 --> 01:26:24,877
- Mick, you fucking kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

1172
01:26:29,753 --> 01:26:32,207
- Hey, Micky.
- Micky, come on in.

1173
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:35,487
You're too loud.
You've got to do this at home, please.

1174
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:39,355
- What are you talking about?
- Mom, please.

1175
01:26:40,596 --> 01:26:43,156
All right, girls. Let's pack it up.

1176
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:10,705
- Why?
- Let's get it put away.

1177
01:27:10,717 --> 01:27:14,533
If that's what Micky wants,
we're going to put it away.

1178
01:27:14,551 --> 01:27:17,353
- There's your brother.
- Dicky!

1179
01:27:18,421 --> 01:27:20,828
Hey there. Hey there.

1180
01:27:24,483 --> 01:27:26,970
It's nice. It's nice.

1181
01:27:27,465 --> 01:27:30,154
- Been working on it for two weeks.
- Hey, Sherri, come on. Stop.

1182
01:27:30,177 --> 01:27:34,134
All right, girls, come on. Let's go home.
It's not the time to do this, obviously.

1183
01:27:39,399 --> 01:27:43,047
- What's going on?
- We ain't going to work together.

1184
01:27:43,071 --> 01:27:45,032
They don't want me to work with him.

1185
01:27:45,055 --> 01:27:47,030
What are you talking about?

1186
01:27:47,477 --> 01:27:49,355
That's not right.

1187
01:27:49,796 --> 01:27:52,684
Micky never would have
won Sanchez without Dicky.

1188
01:27:52,707 --> 01:27:56,394
- That's fucking bullshit! Take it back!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1189
01:27:56,406 --> 01:28:00,093
- Don't you fucking talk to my mother like that.
- Fuck you!

1190
01:28:02,613 --> 01:28:04,567
Why don't you ask Micky?

1191
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:07,509
We're going to train. They've got to go.

1192
01:28:07,522 --> 01:28:09,495
They've got to go, Mick.
Come on.

1193
01:28:09,510 --> 01:28:11,388
- You all right?
- Ask him, George.

1194
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:14,343
Ask him if he would have won Sanchez
without his brother.

1195
01:28:18,047 --> 01:28:20,826
No, I wouldn't have won Sanchez
if it wasn't for Dicky.

1196
01:28:21,596 --> 01:28:24,592
- How can you say that to O'Keefe?
- Because it's true.

1197
01:28:25,268 --> 01:28:29,180
I went in with our game plan and it wasn't working
so I went back to what I learned with Dicky.

1198
01:28:29,194 --> 01:28:31,894
And I wouldn't have won without you,
either, O'Keefe, okay?

1199
01:28:32,834 --> 01:28:36,003
I mean, you know that.
We worked hard. You got me ready.

1200
01:28:36,014 --> 01:28:38,711
You got your confidence
and your focus from O'Keefe,

1201
01:28:38,723 --> 01:28:41,576
and from Sal,
and from your father, and from me.

1202
01:28:44,014 --> 01:28:45,787
- Dicky is a junk bag.
- Hey!

1203
01:28:45,810 --> 01:28:47,137
He's a junk bag!

1204
01:28:47,149 --> 01:28:48,732
- Fuck you, Charlene.
- Oh, fuck you!

1205
01:28:48,756 --> 01:28:49,818
I'm sober.

1206
01:28:49,821 --> 01:28:52,569
Oh, yeah. And I'm sure you're going to need
something for something now that you're out.

1207
01:28:52,593 --> 01:28:54,342
- "Oh, my back! Oh, my back!"
- Fuck you!

1208
01:28:54,359 --> 01:28:56,649
- What are you always picking on me for, huh?
- No, fuck you!

1209
01:28:56,661 --> 01:28:59,024
And what about O'Keefe?
We're in the same boat.

1210
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,801
One day at a fucking time, right, O'Keefe?
You and me.

1211
01:29:01,811 --> 01:29:04,558
It's all right for him to be here?
Why am I the fucking problem?

1212
01:29:04,569 --> 01:29:06,718
- I'm his blood! I'm his family!
- You're the problem!

1213
01:29:06,738 --> 01:29:10,296
I'm the one fighting, okay?
Not you, not you, and not you.

1214
01:29:11,649 --> 01:29:13,583
- I know what I need.
- And you need Dicky?

1215
01:29:13,606 --> 01:29:15,027
I want Dicky back.

1216
01:29:16,522 --> 01:29:18,800
And I want you, Charlene,
and I want O'Keefe.

1217
01:29:18,812 --> 01:29:21,055
I want my family.
What's wrong with that?

1218
01:29:23,173 --> 01:29:26,167
- Not the deal we made, baby.
- She's right, Micky.

1219
01:29:26,191 --> 01:29:28,873
- That's not the deal.
- It wasn't the deal.

1220
01:29:28,896 --> 01:29:30,782
Come on, you can't do this to us.

1221
01:29:30,805 --> 01:29:32,062
You sound like them now.

1222
01:29:32,073 --> 01:29:33,858
- I sound like them now?
- Yeah, you sound like them.

1223
01:29:33,881 --> 01:29:37,415
- We sound like them?
- You can't do this to us. You can't do this to us.

1224
01:29:37,425 --> 01:29:38,776
You sound like them.

1225
01:29:40,146 --> 01:29:41,954
You should fucking listen to yourself.

1226
01:29:41,967 --> 01:29:44,620
You sound like them, just like them.
Maybe this is where you belong.

1227
01:29:44,632 --> 01:29:47,011
- That's the way you love him?
- Charlene!

1228
01:29:47,034 --> 01:29:50,415
- Come on!
- You want your brother? Good luck.

1229
01:29:50,439 --> 01:29:53,124
- O'Keefe, come on...
- Micky.

1230
01:29:53,136 --> 01:29:54,181
Micky...

1231
01:29:57,263 --> 01:29:59,691
Come on,
everything happens for a reason.

1232
01:30:00,696 --> 01:30:02,540
You know, maybe it's for the best.

1233
01:30:04,054 --> 01:30:05,651
God has a plan.

1234
01:30:08,230 --> 01:30:10,303
Want to spar with your brother?

1235
01:30:16,805 --> 01:30:18,695
Dick Eklund, Pride of Lowell.

1236
01:30:19,999 --> 01:30:22,030
Watching that for years, huh?

1237
01:30:25,676 --> 01:30:28,917
Whoa, hey, what the hell are you doing?

1238
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:32,440
- Micky, for crying out loud!
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

1239
01:30:32,445 --> 01:30:36,290
Take that baby out of here.
I told you take him away ten minutes ago!

1240
01:30:36,296 --> 01:30:39,079
Sweetheart, are you all right?
You okay? Your back?

1241
01:30:40,458 --> 01:30:43,504
What are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

1242
01:30:43,516 --> 01:30:45,630
Will it be my fight, Alice? Huh?

1243
01:30:45,641 --> 01:30:49,757
Just once? Maybe just
this one time, not for Dicky?

1244
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:51,130
Huh?

1245
01:30:51,148 --> 01:30:53,273
I know you think he's coming back,

1246
01:30:53,296 --> 01:30:56,889
but he's forty years old and he doesn't have
a tooth in his head that's his fucking own.

1247
01:30:56,906 --> 01:31:00,276
Let your brother talk
for a minute here, all right?

1248
01:31:00,294 --> 01:31:04,876
- What are you saying, sweetheart?
- Shut up before I bust your fucking head open, Dicky.

1249
01:31:04,888 --> 01:31:07,923
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What are you going to do?

1250
01:31:07,935 --> 01:31:10,995
- You want me to bust your fucking head open?
- Come on! Come on! George!

1251
01:31:11,018 --> 01:31:12,924
- Please! Please!
- Dicky!

1252
01:31:12,946 --> 01:31:15,494
What are you saying, sweetheart?
Tell me what you're saying.

1253
01:31:15,518 --> 01:31:17,432
This is supposed to be my fight.

1254
01:31:17,456 --> 01:31:18,900
- This is my shot at a title.
- It is your fight.

1255
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:20,180
I won't get another one after this.

1256
01:31:20,204 --> 01:31:22,705
Am I being selfish?
Am I saying "Micky! Micky! Micky!"?

1257
01:31:22,728 --> 01:31:24,694
Because you know what?
If I am, I'm sorry.

1258
01:31:24,708 --> 01:31:28,683
I thought I was fighting for the championship.
And I thought you were my mother, too.

1259
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,662
I am your mother.

1260
01:31:36,492 --> 01:31:40,844
Mick, I'm sorry. I had no idea
you felt like that, all right?

1261
01:31:40,868 --> 01:31:43,966
If I made mistakes,
I'm going to be better.

1262
01:31:43,977 --> 01:31:47,793
I don't want to hurt you.
I am so sorry.

1263
01:31:47,817 --> 01:31:49,754
I'm sorry.

1264
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:57,136
Dicky!
Stay with him.

1265
01:31:58,064 --> 01:31:59,590
Dicky!

1266
01:32:01,116 --> 01:32:02,490
Dicky!

1267
01:32:07,386 --> 01:32:09,535
- Dicky!
- Got to do something.

1268
01:32:09,547 --> 01:32:11,449
Dicky, wait. Come on.

1269
01:32:12,388 --> 01:32:14,760
Micky wants you. I want you.

1270
01:32:15,147 --> 01:32:18,765
- I've got to do something.
- I know what that means. Don't do this!

1271
01:32:47,015 --> 01:32:48,894
Hey, Jim.

1272
01:32:53,637 --> 01:32:55,058
- Smart.
- Hey, Dicky.

1273
01:32:57,986 --> 01:33:00,405
- Hey, Dicky's back!
- Yay!

1274
01:33:00,428 --> 01:33:02,095
- Hey!
- Dicky!

1275
01:33:03,308 --> 01:33:05,809
- Look at you!
- Look at my boy, huh?

1276
01:33:05,821 --> 01:33:06,960
Come over here.

1277
01:33:06,980 --> 01:33:08,641
You look good. Welcome back.

1278
01:33:08,655 --> 01:33:11,109
- Yeah, you're looking good.
- You look great.

1279
01:33:11,133 --> 01:33:13,141
Good to see you.

1280
01:33:13,159 --> 01:33:15,894
- Welcome home.
- Hi, honey.

1281
01:33:17,555 --> 01:33:19,422
What's up, man? You're looking good.

1282
01:33:19,425 --> 01:33:21,703
So, want to head up there?

1283
01:33:21,726 --> 01:33:23,123
Dicky's back!

1284
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:31,362
Go upstairs, take a while, huh?

1285
01:33:39,167 --> 01:33:42,032
- Throw a little party for you, babe.
- Hey, come back!

1286
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:46,550
- The fuck was that all about?
- What the hell was that?

1287
01:34:01,867 --> 01:34:04,099
Charlene, it's Dicky.

1288
01:34:06,003 --> 01:34:08,600
Get off my porch, you piece of shit.

1289
01:34:10,731 --> 01:34:12,442
How fucking dare you come?

1290
01:34:13,977 --> 01:34:15,960
Cock sucker!

1291
01:34:15,961 --> 01:34:17,147
Fucking boy!

1292
01:34:17,153 --> 01:34:18,139
Fucking ass!

1293
01:34:18,151 --> 01:34:18,961
Fucking sick!

1294
01:34:20,264 --> 01:34:23,292
You're a fucking asshole, Dicky.
I want you off my fucking porch.

1295
01:34:23,315 --> 01:34:27,213
Huh? Why don't you just fucking
come down here and talk to me, huh?

1296
01:34:27,237 --> 01:34:29,159
You're such an asshole,
coming to my fucking house.

1297
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:31,354
- You piece of shit, standing on my porch!
- Sorry, sorry.

1298
01:34:31,379 --> 01:34:34,960
It's not fucking ladylike to be shouting
in the street like this, all right?

1299
01:34:34,972 --> 01:34:37,672
- You're such a fucking cock sucker, coming over here.
- Please!

1300
01:34:37,684 --> 01:34:39,633
- Oh yeah? You think I fucking care?
- Come on. Just fucking...

1301
01:34:39,645 --> 01:34:41,933
Get off my fucking porch, Dicky.

1302
01:34:55,629 --> 01:34:57,985
What kind of dog is that?
Is that a cocker spaniel?

1303
01:35:04,317 --> 01:35:05,937
All right,
I know you can't fucking stand me.

1304
01:35:05,949 --> 01:35:09,296
- Really, what makes you say that?
- I got news for you, all right?

1305
01:35:09,319 --> 01:35:11,046
My brother loves you,

1306
01:35:11,071 --> 01:35:13,478
and you can't just run away because of me.

1307
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:18,404
You don't deserve that, all right?
So I will quit if you want me to quit.

1308
01:35:18,416 --> 01:35:20,806
- You're full of shit.
- I swear to God.

1309
01:35:20,818 --> 01:35:23,024
I will quit if it means
you'll come back, all right?

1310
01:35:23,048 --> 01:35:24,833
But I want you to
think about something.

1311
01:35:24,848 --> 01:35:27,937
Micky has a chance to do
something that I never did,

1312
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,191
that in my time, I never had.

1313
01:35:30,215 --> 01:35:33,376
Oh... "Yeah, my big chance was with
Sugar Ray Leonard. I'm so great."

1314
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:36,699
"I'm the Pride of fucking Lowell.
Oh yeah, I fought Sugar Ray Leonard."

1315
01:35:36,723 --> 01:35:38,378
- I've heard it.
- I came to make things right with you.

1316
01:35:38,390 --> 01:35:41,347
Okay, let's make things right.
Number one:

1317
01:35:41,359 --> 01:35:43,625
You didn't knock down
Sugar Ray Leonard. He tripped.

1318
01:35:46,071 --> 01:35:50,662
I was in the ring. Don't you think I know
what really fucking happened that day?

1319
01:35:50,677 --> 01:35:53,166
- What have you ever done with your life?
- I like my life.

1320
01:35:53,190 --> 01:35:55,020
- Yeah? What have you ever done with it?
- I like my life now, Dicky.

1321
01:35:55,032 --> 01:35:57,181
What have you ever done with your life?

1322
01:35:57,194 --> 01:36:00,975
You're a college dropout, Charlene.
You're just a little bar girl. Your life sucks.

1323
01:36:03,023 --> 01:36:04,085
All right.

1324
01:36:05,277 --> 01:36:08,424
I drink too much.
I worked in a lot of bars.

1325
01:36:08,443 --> 01:36:11,695
And I ruined a lot of opportunities,
but I'm trying to do better here.

1326
01:36:11,719 --> 01:36:13,726
- So is Micky.
- So am I.

1327
01:36:15,756 --> 01:36:20,124
And he needs me, you heard him.
And I know he needs you.

1328
01:36:23,719 --> 01:36:25,691
What is that blue shit on your arm?

1329
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:28,408
It's icing.

1330
01:36:31,891 --> 01:36:33,554
Okay.

1331
01:36:33,566 --> 01:36:36,231
I'll see you in Micky's corner.
Otherwise, go fuck yourself.

1332
01:36:36,255 --> 01:36:38,355
- It's a deal.
- All right, it's a deal.

1333
01:36:50,721 --> 01:36:52,966
We worked it out for you. Ask her.

1334
01:36:54,702 --> 01:36:57,837
Good. Go get O'Keefe back, too.

1335
01:36:59,425 --> 01:37:00,644
I will.

1336
01:37:06,436 --> 01:37:07,581
Hey, Mick.

1337
01:37:09,872 --> 01:37:12,056
Do you think I knocked down
Sugar Ray Leonard?

1338
01:37:13,531 --> 01:37:16,443
You went ten rounds. One of the best
to do anything to hurt him.

1339
01:37:17,418 --> 01:37:18,651
You're my hero.

1340
01:37:19,878 --> 01:37:21,289
I was.

1341
01:37:23,244 --> 01:37:24,606
I was...

1342
01:37:30,049 --> 01:37:33,231
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah?

1343
01:38:51,798 --> 01:38:54,275
There's a press conference downstairs.

1344
01:38:54,276 --> 01:38:56,706
- Come on. Let's go.
- Guys...

1345
01:38:58,181 --> 01:39:02,220
Neary: Ten stone, six pounds.

1346
01:39:08,617 --> 01:39:13,018
Ward: Ten stone, six pounds.

1347
01:39:14,348 --> 01:39:17,213
Hey, Micky. Micky Ward!
We have a question over here.

1348
01:39:19,009 --> 01:39:20,511
How have you been training?

1349
01:39:20,535 --> 01:39:24,010
- I train. I train hard.
- Shea's 22 in 0. Never been knocked down.

1350
01:39:24,033 --> 01:39:25,924
Well that's going to change tomorrow.

1351
01:39:25,935 --> 01:39:28,124
In fact we expected a much better fighter.

1352
01:39:28,861 --> 01:39:32,465
I'm just grateful to be here and have
the opportunity. Thank you, guys, for the shot.

1353
01:39:32,474 --> 01:39:35,081
Shea, who do you respect as a fighter?

1354
01:39:35,090 --> 01:39:37,826
And who would you like to fight next?

1355
01:39:37,830 --> 01:39:40,472
I plan on moving
right through Micky Ward tomorrow,

1356
01:39:40,484 --> 01:39:43,208
moving on to other big fighters,
like Gatti.

1357
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:45,568
I believe Gatti and I would
make a great match.

1358
01:39:59,652 --> 01:40:02,940
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
twelve rounds of boxing

1359
01:40:02,963 --> 01:40:09,351
for the WBU Welterweight
Championship of the World!

1360
01:40:55,847 --> 01:40:58,183
Don't listen to them, Mick.

1361
01:41:11,204 --> 01:41:14,668
And there is Micky Ward
of Lowell, Massachusetts entering the ring.

1362
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:17,639
It's his first fight outside the United States.

1363
01:41:17,653 --> 01:41:20,483
Micky Ward, 30 wins, 7 losses...

1364
01:41:20,506 --> 01:41:23,794
He's back and better, recently.
Twenty KOs.

1365
01:41:23,806 --> 01:41:28,378
And now Ward awaits his opponent,
Shea Neary.

1366
01:41:28,393 --> 01:41:33,176
Neary regards himself as
the European Arturo Gatti,

1367
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:36,464
meaning that he is a head-on
high-contact fighter

1368
01:41:36,476 --> 01:41:40,174
who throws seventy punches per round.

1369
01:41:40,192 --> 01:41:44,254
Neary is from Liverpool and should
have a huge following her tonight.

1370
01:41:46,157 --> 01:41:50,463
Accompanied by "Paint the Town Red"
by the Mahones.

1371
01:41:50,482 --> 01:41:53,904
Neary is the current
Welterweight Champion of the World.

1372
01:41:53,928 --> 01:41:59,888
He is a very tough young man.
Beyond dedicated. Lives a spartan existence.

1373
01:41:59,889 --> 01:42:05,195
And according to his promoters,
there's nothing but eat, drink, think,

1374
01:42:05,206 --> 01:42:09,069
fantasize and dream of fighting.

1375
01:42:09,093 --> 01:42:12,694
Shea Neary has had 22 professional fights
and won them all.

1376
01:42:12,695 --> 01:42:15,256
Seventeen KOs.

1377
01:42:24,989 --> 01:42:28,434
Start when you hear the bell.
Shake hands.

1378
01:42:29,052 --> 01:42:32,023
Both of you. Shake hands.

1379
01:42:33,211 --> 01:42:38,963
As close as we just saw them in the middle
of the ring, forehead to forehead.

1380
01:42:38,964 --> 01:42:45,451
That's how close we expect them to be
for as long as this fight goes on.

1381
01:42:45,472 --> 01:42:49,499
Ward is a long ways from home.
Don't coast in a foreign country.

1382
01:42:49,522 --> 01:42:54,453
Well the big challenge for Ward is to get off
to a faster start than is customary for him.

1383
01:42:54,454 --> 01:42:58,003
Micky Ward a notoriously slow starter
in big fights.

1384
01:42:58,013 --> 01:43:00,502
Shea Neary an ultra-fast starter.

1385
01:43:00,517 --> 01:43:04,941
And that's the question that hovers
over round one. Get ready for the fight.

1386
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:07,954
Already Shea Neary starts
taking it to him on the ropes.

1387
01:43:07,978 --> 01:43:11,501
And Neary going to the body,
which is Ward's specialty.

1388
01:43:12,041 --> 01:43:14,988
- Whoa!
- Neary bangs Ward to the body.

1389
01:43:15,012 --> 01:43:19,133
- And a big uppercut by Neary.
- Neary leads off with a good left jab.

1390
01:43:19,139 --> 01:43:22,767
Keeps opponents off balance,
jabbing here and there.

1391
01:43:25,098 --> 01:43:28,779
That was a good left hook by Neary
as he stepped in on Ward.

1392
01:43:28,790 --> 01:43:33,639
Ward not able to deal with him very well
when Neary stands at range like this.

1393
01:43:33,650 --> 01:43:36,327
- Come on!
- That's it! Get him!

1394
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:39,790
My, is it tough for Micky Ward.

1395
01:43:39,808 --> 01:43:45,142
Neary digging his own right hand to the body.
They trade shots at close range.

1396
01:43:45,166 --> 01:43:48,009
Ward is trying to match Neary blow-for-blow,

1397
01:43:48,033 --> 01:43:53,033
and now Neary starts to come on
and take the last thirty seconds to the round.

1398
01:43:53,046 --> 01:43:55,476
- How about that!
- Break!

1399
01:43:56,884 --> 01:44:01,545
Tremendous barrage in the first minute.
Just look at this. Unbelievable.

1400
01:44:01,557 --> 01:44:04,050
What a great round one!

1401
01:44:04,074 --> 01:44:08,150
Ward is going to have to
pick up the tempo

1402
01:44:08,162 --> 01:44:10,052
and beat him with volumes of punching.

1403
01:44:10,058 --> 01:44:12,406
No doubt Neary is a better boxer.

1404
01:44:15,521 --> 01:44:20,629
Four hard right hands
Neary has belted in the last minute.

1405
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:25,617
Quicker than Ward, more assertive than Ward.
Surer of what he wants to do.

1406
01:44:25,628 --> 01:44:28,794
They're standing and trading shots
at the center of the ring.

1407
01:44:28,806 --> 01:44:31,872
Ward's going to have to step it up
a little bit more than he is right now.

1408
01:44:31,889 --> 01:44:35,435
Micky Ward's corner taking
a really deep look at what's going on now,

1409
01:44:35,458 --> 01:44:38,664
and his family at ringside
well aware he's stepping up in class.

1410
01:44:38,681 --> 01:44:42,464
Ward has to got to be more aggressive.

1411
01:44:42,474 --> 01:44:45,173
He can't just try to wait until
everything is perfect.

1412
01:44:45,185 --> 01:44:47,815
Despondence over Micky Ward
is increasing as the fight goes on

1413
01:44:47,829 --> 01:44:51,949
because his plan was the right one
and he's executing it.

1414
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:59,236
Punches like these make it seem
that it's now Neary's fight.

1415
01:45:00,686 --> 01:45:05,982
Ward hasn't been in this kind of war
with as strong a fighter as Neary.

1416
01:45:07,467 --> 01:45:11,032
They are trying to hurt each other
with only punches.

1417
01:45:11,039 --> 01:45:15,807
They've tested each other's will,
now they're testing each other's skill.

1418
01:45:15,818 --> 01:45:19,258
And Ward fumbled there
by a right cross from Neary.

1419
01:45:19,269 --> 01:45:25,651
- Ward hurting now, his legs are gone.
- Neary goes to the body as he tries to finish Micky.

1420
01:45:26,466 --> 01:45:32,301
- Vicious body shots from Neary.
- And Ward doesn't even try to move off the ropes.

1421
01:45:32,313 --> 01:45:37,280
I don't know if he can, Jeff.
He's waiting for Neary to punch himself out.

1422
01:45:37,281 --> 01:45:41,562
Down goes Micky Ward, and he may be out.

1423
01:45:43,268 --> 01:45:44,929
Come on, that's it!

1424
01:45:45,792 --> 01:45:47,530
That's my boy!

1425
01:45:47,535 --> 01:45:50,459
Forward! Forward!
Come on!

1426
01:45:51,978 --> 01:45:56,735
- Ward is out on his feet!
- Loser! Go back to America!

1427
01:45:56,746 --> 01:45:58,879
This could be it for Micky Ward.

1428
01:45:58,902 --> 01:46:01,555
Dicky, get him a fucking stool
Where's the stool?

1429
01:46:01,567 --> 01:46:04,223
Charlene, will you get the fuck
out of here with your high heels?

1430
01:46:05,142 --> 01:46:09,770
His brother's got Ward jumping
to wake up his legs.

1431
01:46:09,782 --> 01:46:13,256
I think this could be Ward's last chance
to turn this fight around.

1432
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:18,100
It's Micky Ward against the aggressiveness
and clean punching of Shea Neary.

1433
01:46:19,037 --> 01:46:22,430
If you don't have your defense up
you can really get hurt.

1434
01:46:22,454 --> 01:46:25,160
He's making it very difficult for Micky Ward.

1435
01:46:25,172 --> 01:46:27,966
I don't think he's going to give it to him,
at this rate.

1436
01:46:27,990 --> 01:46:30,009
This is a survival move.

1437
01:46:30,031 --> 01:46:33,753
Are you like me? Huh?
Just good enough to fight Sugar Ray?

1438
01:46:33,777 --> 01:46:37,293
I never had to win, did I?
You've got to do more than that.

1439
01:46:37,316 --> 01:46:42,447
You've got to win a title.
For you, for me, for Lowell.

1440
01:46:42,470 --> 01:46:44,948
This is your time, all right?
You take it.

1441
01:46:44,972 --> 01:46:47,865
I had my time, and I blew it.
You don't have to, all right?

1442
01:46:47,934 --> 01:46:51,649
Now fucking get out there.
Bring that fucking anger.

1443
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:54,290
All the shit you've been through
over the fucking years,

1444
01:46:54,307 --> 01:46:56,935
put it in the ring right now.
This is yours. This is fucking yours.

1445
01:46:57,010 --> 01:46:59,860
- Okay.
- Fucking head, body, head, body.

1446
01:46:59,884 --> 01:47:03,371
- Say it back to me.
- Head, body, head, body.

1447
01:47:03,389 --> 01:47:07,278
You can do it.
Stay off the fucking ropes.

1448
01:47:11,972 --> 01:47:14,238
If I'm in Micky Ward's corner tonight,

1449
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:17,807
I'm thinking if he doesn't pick things up
this round and get going,

1450
01:47:17,824 --> 01:47:22,005
he'll just get totally wiped out.

1451
01:47:22,010 --> 01:47:24,487
Get off the ropes!
Get off the ropes, Mick!

1452
01:47:25,075 --> 01:47:28,797
Once again, Ward against the ropes
as Neary is free to attack.

1453
01:47:28,820 --> 01:47:31,200
What are you doing?
Come on, Mick...

1454
01:47:31,818 --> 01:47:35,538
Sometimes if you want to win,
you've got to be something that you're not.

1455
01:47:37,550 --> 01:47:39,211
Off the fucking rope, man!
That ain't it!

1456
01:47:39,655 --> 01:47:42,254
Neary continues to pound away.

1457
01:47:44,566 --> 01:47:48,592
Don't take no abuse!
This is your time, Micky!

1458
01:47:48,594 --> 01:47:50,586
It's all for you!

1459
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:52,857
- Two big misses by Neary.
- That's it! That's it!

1460
01:47:52,867 --> 01:47:56,718
Ward seemingly getting his legs back.

1461
01:47:56,742 --> 01:48:00,957
Now he backs Neary up.
Ward trades his way back.

1462
01:48:00,974 --> 01:48:04,020
Ward nods as if to say "Come on!".

1463
01:48:04,021 --> 01:48:06,592
"Come on, let's fight!"

1464
01:48:06,613 --> 01:48:09,986
Closer and closer to Neary's ribcage.

1465
01:48:10,009 --> 01:48:12,604
This is becoming Micky Ward's fight.

1466
01:48:12,616 --> 01:48:15,246
And a left hook to the body,
and an uppercut lands,

1467
01:48:15,257 --> 01:48:17,970
and now he backs Neary up.

1468
01:48:17,990 --> 01:48:20,973
Ward hits Neary with a body shot.

1469
01:48:20,984 --> 01:48:23,731
Four left hooks in the body.

1470
01:48:25,835 --> 01:48:29,710
Neary on his butt,
first time in 23 professional fights

1471
01:48:29,721 --> 01:48:33,343
that Shea Neary has gone down.

1472
01:48:33,351 --> 01:48:35,782
This is it! This is it, Micky!

1473
01:48:35,794 --> 01:48:41,012
23 seconds remain in this round
as Micky now wipes off Neary's gloves.

1474
01:48:43,530 --> 01:48:49,634
Ward lands a huge left hook
as Micky Ward works away.

1475
01:48:49,635 --> 01:48:53,463
Blows to the body with the left hook.
There's the uppercut again!

1476
01:48:55,528 --> 01:48:57,788
Gonna stop it right there.

1477
01:48:57,811 --> 01:49:02,825
"Irish" Micky Ward with a big
eighth-round TKO!

1478
01:49:02,833 --> 01:49:06,806
He's done it again.
He's done it again.

1479
01:49:06,817 --> 01:49:11,943
They grinding gutting Micky Ward
pulls out another big victory.

1480
01:49:24,691 --> 01:49:28,938
You're the champion of the world, Mick!
You're the fucking champion of the world!

1481
01:49:28,956 --> 01:49:31,434
You fucking did it!

1482
01:49:44,196 --> 01:49:47,214
My boy's the champion of the world!

1483
01:49:47,215 --> 01:49:49,280
I love you!

1484
01:50:19,454 --> 01:50:23,035
This town always said
you're a fucking boxer, right?

1485
01:50:23,059 --> 01:50:25,424
You thought it's a piece of shit.

- He put Lowell back on the map, you know.
- We did.

1487
01:50:27,772 --> 01:50:30,802
- I tell you. No, hold on.
- We.

1488
01:50:30,818 --> 01:50:33,954
Who used to be the Pride of Lowell?
Right here.

1489
01:50:33,956 --> 01:50:36,562
Who's the Pride of Lowell now?
Right there.

1490
01:50:36,563 --> 01:50:38,641
That's how it's meant to be, you know?

Oh, Boo Boo. Quacker!

1497
01:51:19,928 --> 01:51:22,687
- Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack!
- Boo Boo...

1498
01:51:22,705 --> 01:51:24,783
Boo, where's your teeth?
