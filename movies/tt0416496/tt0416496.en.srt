2
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:48,295
Please, take notes.

3
00:01:48,755 --> 00:01:52,216
There are no wounds
to indicate foul play from a weapon.

4
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:56,845
The contents ofthe safe are intact,
ruling out robbery as a motive.

5
00:01:57,013 --> 00:02:02,059
We found only the victim's fingerprints,
on the doorknob and door frame.

6
00:02:02,227 --> 00:02:07,189
Indicating no one entered or left the room.
The window is locked from the inside.

7
00:02:07,357 --> 00:02:11,569
No one entered that way,
ruling out homicide as a cause of death.

8
00:02:11,778 --> 00:02:15,573
There's no whisky in the glass
or on the deceased's breath.

9
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,785
There are no fibers on her shoes,
so she never stood on the carpet.

10
00:02:19,953 --> 00:02:22,997
There's a scuff on her right shoe tip.

11
00:02:23,164 --> 00:02:26,584
There's traces of polish
on this upturned bit of carpet.

12
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:31,463
There are traces of
flower pollen on the edges ofthe nostril.

13
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:36,010
I therefore conclude
from the evidence gathered...

14
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,430
The deceased entered with some flowers.

15
00:02:39,848 --> 00:02:45,562
She placed them in a vase by the door.
She took the vase and the whisky tumbler,

16
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,108
and went across the room.
The flowers got too close to her nose,

17
00:02:50,276 --> 00:02:53,111
and she sneezed!
Her foot slipped forward.

18
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:55,405
Caught her shoe on the carpet.

19
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:58,783
Tripped, hit her head.
Died from shock to the brain.

20
00:02:58,951 --> 00:03:02,287
It was not foul play
that killed this poor woman,

21
00:03:02,455 --> 00:03:06,166
but an accident caused by a simple sneeze.

22
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,461
And in fact it is not a woman at all.

23
00:03:09,795 --> 00:03:13,798
But a man,
wearing a horse-haired wig.

24
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:25,852
Bravo!

25
00:03:33,653 --> 00:03:37,155
Oh, Quentin, I'm so proud!
- You know what this means?

26
00:03:37,323 --> 00:03:41,034
That we can marry!
- Science has a place in police work.

27
00:03:42,244 --> 00:03:43,370
I proved it.

28
00:03:43,537 --> 00:03:49,167
I convinced all of them.
- Now there's only 1 person left to convince.

29
00:03:49,335 --> 00:03:52,379
I'm convinced.
But you must remember Mr. Jackson,

30
00:03:52,546 --> 00:03:55,173
ifwe don't own the land within 90 days,

31
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:59,511
the railroad will go
to other banks to finance their expansion.

32
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:01,513
No worries, Mr. Ashe.

33
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:05,433
In 90 days we'll be
laying track right through Mexico City.

34
00:04:18,197 --> 00:04:19,572
Go!

35
00:04:20,491 --> 00:04:22,534
That's a good one.

36
00:04:25,538 --> 00:04:26,913
You do better.

37
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:31,960
How could you sell my farm to the gringos?
- Pedro, we have no choice.

38
00:04:32,128 --> 00:04:36,506
The American banks control the cash flow,
and so, they control us.

39
00:04:36,632 --> 00:04:40,593
Don Diego is doing all he can.
- I'm sure Don Diego is.

40
00:04:40,761 --> 00:04:45,391
But I've worked my whole life
to leave something to my poor daughter.

41
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:49,937
All she knows is the farm life.
What will become of her?

42
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,578
You cheated!
I wasn't concentrating.

43
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,958
Best of 3.

44
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:22,762
Let me talk to Bernado.
- He just follows orders.

45
00:05:23,722 --> 00:05:27,308
So we're going to stand by
and let them steal our land?

46
00:05:27,476 --> 00:05:31,312
Unless some higher authority intercedes...

47
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:35,691
Maria, where are you going?
- To the higher authority.

48
00:06:07,057 --> 00:06:10,601
Up! Up!

49
00:06:26,034 --> 00:06:29,119
Her mother's spitting image,
God rest her soul.

50
00:06:29,246 --> 00:06:32,957
My condolences, Don Diego.
- 20 years she's gone, now.

51
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:39,673
She left you a beautiful daughter.
- She's been at school 10 years in Europe.

52
00:06:39,841 --> 00:06:43,260
Left a girl, came home a woman.
- Indeed.

53
00:06:44,512 --> 00:06:47,389
My problem now is convincing her to stay.

54
00:06:47,557 --> 00:06:51,476
She's been home for a week
and already, she wants to go back.

55
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,982
Where's Don Diego?

56
00:06:57,149 --> 00:07:00,402
He can't be disturbed.
- Neither can I, but I am.

57
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:02,779
He's with an important person.

58
00:07:02,947 --> 00:07:08,869
He's always said every client is important.
- This is not a client, Maria.

59
00:07:09,036 --> 00:07:11,788
This is a man from the Bank of New York.

60
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:14,791
I knew it.

61
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:21,131
Gotta pay the toll.

62
00:07:33,477 --> 00:07:38,565
Mi corazon, may I present Mr. Jackson
from the Capitol Bank and Trust of New York.

63
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:42,986
How do you do, Mr. Jackson?
- Infinitely better in your presence.

64
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,407
Gracias.
- Afternoon tea. How civilized.

65
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:51,411
Are you surprised that we're civilized?
- No.

66
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:55,624
Not at all. I find it charming.
- Charming?

67
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:01,880
If you use this word, I presume you've never
experienced the pleasure of an afternoon tea.

68
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:07,427
Mr. Jackson's bank will provide us with
the capital to continue what we're doing.

69
00:08:08,262 --> 00:08:11,431
We were just going over the papers.

70
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:16,645
A big New York bank
interested in our small Mexican bank.

71
00:08:16,854 --> 00:08:18,855
Why is that Mr. Jackson?

72
00:08:19,023 --> 00:08:22,817
If you can't help friends in need,
who can you help?

73
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:27,948
In Europe we have another perspective
on the American definition offriendship.

74
00:08:28,115 --> 00:08:32,994
Forgive my ignorance, Señorita.
I'm uninformed on the European perspective.

75
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:35,665
But I'm always willing to learn.

76
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:40,086
I'd be delighted if you'd enlighten me,
perhaps over dinner?

77
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,589
Perhaps some other time.
I have a long ride tomorrow.

78
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:46,008
Checkmate!

79
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:50,930
Hasta mañana, Papa.
- Hasta mañana.

80
00:08:51,556 --> 00:08:53,057
Goodbye, Mr. Jackson.

81
00:08:53,642 --> 00:08:59,271
Men! They only have one thing on their minds!
And by the way, that includes you.

82
00:08:59,398 --> 00:09:03,025
I see how you look at that
little filly of Señor Gomez.

83
00:09:03,193 --> 00:09:06,445
A little more. A little more.

84
00:09:22,713 --> 00:09:24,630
Stay here!

85
00:09:26,383 --> 00:09:28,551
Don't talk to anybody.

86
00:09:55,787 --> 00:09:58,122
Excuse me? Excuse me?

87
00:09:59,374 --> 00:10:02,710
What was that hmm? Is there a problem?
- For me, no.

88
00:10:02,878 --> 00:10:07,506
For the horse you poke with metal,
every time you want it to do something?

89
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:12,970
For him, I'm sure it's a problem.
But he's too polite to say anything.

90
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,473
Certainly more polite than you.

91
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,976
Thank you for your opinion,
misinformed as it is.

92
00:10:19,227 --> 00:10:22,813
What are you doing in my house?
- So, you're the daughter.

93
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:26,067
Yes, I am. And you are?
- Maria Alvarez.

94
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:29,612
Do you work for us?
- No, I do not work for you.

95
00:10:29,946 --> 00:10:33,575
Why are you here?
- I have business with your father.

96
00:10:35,411 --> 00:10:38,455
What sort of business?
- Private business.

97
00:10:38,998 --> 00:10:40,040
Hey!

98
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:42,584
Hey, stop!

99
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:47,589
Maria!

100
00:10:49,217 --> 00:10:51,343
Stop her!

101
00:10:59,852 --> 00:11:03,355
I knew it!
You helped the Gringos steal our land!

102
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:06,733
You betray your people!
- How dare you accuse me!

103
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:12,072
Get her out of here! Have her arrested!
- Traitor! Thief! You'll pay for this!

104
00:11:12,865 --> 00:11:13,907
I'm sorry.

105
00:11:14,117 --> 00:11:16,451
They're stealing our land!

106
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:21,540
Don Diego is a traitor!

107
00:11:26,003 --> 00:11:28,505
The future.
- To the future.

108
00:11:40,518 --> 00:11:44,062
Buenos dias amigos.
Are you lost?

109
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,151
Mister Alvarez, Pedro?
You're delinquent on your loan payments.

110
00:11:49,318 --> 00:11:52,654
How can I pay
when the interest is more than I earn?

111
00:11:52,822 --> 00:11:55,323
Says here that if you're in arrears,

112
00:11:55,783 --> 00:12:00,120
we have the right to foreclose,
and buy this property for 1 peso.

113
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:06,126
Que cabrones.
Over my dead body.

114
00:12:06,502 --> 00:12:07,544
No problem.

115
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:18,138
There's your receipt, Mister Alvarez, Pedro.

116
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:20,307
Burn it!

117
00:12:32,362 --> 00:12:35,239
You should have locked them up,
not me.

118
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:38,743
They didn't break into a house.
- They're doing worse.

119
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:42,288
You want my advice?
Stop trying to change the world.

120
00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:47,251
You want my advice, Gustavo?
You should start trying to change the world.

121
00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:50,963
Eat!

122
00:12:57,387 --> 00:13:00,056
The poultice to help your horse's hoof.

123
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:04,185
Thank you.

124
00:13:04,645 --> 00:13:08,439
Now who's gonna be outside?

125
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:11,692
Keep an eye on her.

126
00:13:15,489 --> 00:13:18,616
What are you doing here?
- Read this, old man.

127
00:13:18,992 --> 00:13:21,077
What's this?
- It's for you.

128
00:13:21,245 --> 00:13:25,456
You haven't made your payments
so we're foreclosing on this property.

129
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:29,961
I've given you everything
you're getting from me. Get out!

130
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:10,601
Papa!

131
00:14:17,426 --> 00:14:18,467
Maria.

132
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:39,781
Papa! Papa!

133
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:44,202
Somebody please, go get a doctor.

134
00:14:44,412 --> 00:14:47,080
What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

135
00:14:47,332 --> 00:14:51,084
We were finishing the arrangements...
- You killed him.

136
00:14:51,252 --> 00:14:54,921
You killed my father!
- He's evidently had a heart attack.

137
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:57,924
No! He was health...

138
00:14:58,092 --> 00:14:59,968
He was healthy!

139
00:15:00,178 --> 00:15:02,971
You did something to him!
I know you did!

140
00:15:03,264 --> 00:15:08,393
I know this is a terrible shock for you,
but you need to try and remain calm.

141
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,562
In fact, you need to sit down.

142
00:15:11,898 --> 00:15:16,568
Grief is intense, I understand.
But if you can, let's review this calmly.

143
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:20,280
Your father's dead.
Everything he had, is mine.

144
00:15:20,448 --> 00:15:24,159
In your belief that I caused his death,
you attacked me.

145
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,996
You're trying to kill me.
I react in self-defense.

146
00:15:28,164 --> 00:15:33,418
Before we can stop this, I shoot you dead.
But it doesn't have to end that way.

147
00:15:36,506 --> 00:15:39,091
Look at that, darling.

148
00:15:39,258 --> 00:15:40,842
It's choosing time.

149
00:15:50,436 --> 00:15:51,853
That's it.

150
00:15:56,692 --> 00:15:58,693
I guess we've got a deal.

151
00:15:59,946 --> 00:16:03,198
If you don't mind, I need to go to my room.

152
00:16:03,741 --> 00:16:05,492
I must lie down.

153
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,454
This is all too much for me, at once.
You understand?

154
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:15,419
Yes, absolutely.

155
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:16,628
I understand.

156
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:21,675
Take all the time you need.

157
00:16:25,973 --> 00:16:28,391
Don't worry about a thing.

158
00:16:29,476 --> 00:16:32,353
I'll make all the arrangements.

159
00:16:42,156 --> 00:16:43,489
Oh, darling?

160
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:49,662
You like your
afternoon tea sent up to your room?

161
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:56,752
That would be very nice.
Thank you.

162
00:17:16,773 --> 00:17:20,359
Hey, get back here!
Come back here, you bitch!

163
00:17:21,403 --> 00:17:23,821
Come back!

164
00:17:29,745 --> 00:17:31,037
I got you now!

165
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:36,417
Hey!

166
00:18:07,074 --> 00:18:09,075
God dammit!

167
00:18:31,516 --> 00:18:33,559
Padre!
- Maria!

168
00:18:36,145 --> 00:18:40,524
They shot him.
- I know, my child. I know.

169
00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:06,800
What do you want from me?
I have nothing to give you! Nothing!

170
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,637
You should have eaten
when you had the chance.

171
00:19:53,473 --> 00:19:55,807
Get out of here! Shoo!

172
00:20:21,126 --> 00:20:24,587
Hands up! No one...

173
00:20:25,214 --> 00:20:28,049
move!

174
00:20:35,057 --> 00:20:39,143
What are you doing?
- What do you think?

175
00:20:39,395 --> 00:20:42,480
I'm taking this bank.
- With an unloaded gun?

176
00:20:42,648 --> 00:20:45,650
How do you know?
- There's no bullets.

177
00:20:45,818 --> 00:20:48,861
You're not robbing this bank.
Find another one.

178
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:51,989
It's the only bank in town,
and it's my father's.

179
00:20:52,157 --> 00:20:56,494
Take that off. It doesn't match your shirt.
Everyone knows It's you.

180
00:20:56,662 --> 00:20:59,914
Who wouldn't recognize that voice?
"My father's bank!"

181
00:21:00,124 --> 00:21:03,418
It is my father's bank.
Now I need to finish my job.

182
00:21:03,585 --> 00:21:07,046
Señoritas.
- Stealing from the people is hardly a job.

183
00:21:07,506 --> 00:21:09,590
Señoritas!

184
00:21:09,758 --> 00:21:14,679
I am not stealing. I'm taking it back
from the bastards who murdered my father.

185
00:21:14,847 --> 00:21:16,681
They killed him?
- Señoritas!

186
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:18,307
What?

187
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,312
We're going to secure,
and then remove all deposits from this bank.

188
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,982
Then instill some new confidence in it.

189
00:21:26,191 --> 00:21:29,110
I want the stars and stripes flying up there.

190
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:32,989
So it starts looking
a little more American, down here.

191
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,201
Señor Manager?

192
00:21:37,911 --> 00:21:43,082
This establishment is now a subsidiary
ofthe Capitol Bank and Trust of New York.

193
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,091
Let's open up a vault.

194
00:21:46,092 --> 00:21:49,531
See what kind of cash is on hand,
in the liquid assets department.

195
00:21:51,008 --> 00:21:55,803
Excuse me, where is the vault?
- In Don Diego's office.

196
00:21:55,971 --> 00:22:01,934
Well. I guess that would be
Señor Jackson's office now, wouldn't it?

197
00:22:11,403 --> 00:22:16,492
Ha ha ha! We did it!
We did it! We did it! We did it!

198
00:22:20,663 --> 00:22:23,207
We did it.
- What do you think you did?

199
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,542
We'll help lots of people.

200
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:30,714
To help, you'd have to reverse the
massive theft of property that's taken place.

201
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:34,676
Listen.
How many kilos of rice can we buy with this?

202
00:22:34,969 --> 00:22:38,305
We can feed 500 people!

203
00:22:40,975 --> 00:22:44,144
Why were you robbing the bank?
- Revenge.

204
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:47,940
So you weren't doing it to help the people?
- No!

205
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,656
What?

206
00:22:56,533 --> 00:22:59,785
Stop looking at me that way.
My life is not here.

207
00:23:01,496 --> 00:23:04,331
What are you doing?
- I'm taking the money.

208
00:23:04,499 --> 00:23:08,293
I'm going back to Europe.
- You're joking?

209
00:23:08,461 --> 00:23:12,756
Alright, you can take half.
You can even keep the dog as a bonus.

210
00:23:15,718 --> 00:23:19,346
If you want to go, go.
But the money stays. All of it.

211
00:23:19,514 --> 00:23:21,431
No, it doesn't.
- Yes.

212
00:23:21,724 --> 00:23:23,517
No. it doesn't.

213
00:24:35,925 --> 00:24:41,804
We were debating the basic
economic theories ofwealth distribution.

214
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:46,434
Yes. Yes, we were.
- That's good.

215
00:24:46,602 --> 00:24:49,520
But before you reach any hasty conclusions,

216
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,481
let me show you something.

217
00:25:44,368 --> 00:25:48,413
What?
Rice and beans are not good enough for you?

218
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,958
I can't eat when I see
what's been done to the people.

219
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:54,877
At least tonight they can eat.

220
00:25:56,338 --> 00:26:00,675
We have to get their land back.
We must come up with a plan.

221
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:06,556
Something that would benefit the people,
and destroy these murderers.

222
00:26:08,351 --> 00:26:11,437
I think we should rob more banks.
Yeah.

223
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,947
Let's go!
- Let's go where?

224
00:26:22,115 --> 00:26:24,199
Let's go rob more banks.

225
00:26:24,451 --> 00:26:28,370
We can't just go, right now, and rob a bank.

226
00:26:28,538 --> 00:26:32,624
Fine. Finish brushing.
- That's not it. We're not ready.

227
00:26:33,251 --> 00:26:37,546
Yes, we are. We just did it.
- We were lucky. We can't rely on luck.

228
00:26:37,714 --> 00:26:43,260
We need to think first. We need to
consider the implications, the consequences.

229
00:26:43,428 --> 00:26:46,346
You're so complicated!
- You're so unrealistic!

230
00:26:46,514 --> 00:26:51,602
This is a noble cause
you seek to undertake, Señoritas.

231
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:57,775
But if you keep fighting like cats and dogs,
you won't make it to sunrise.

232
00:26:57,942 --> 00:27:01,612
My daughters, you know...

233
00:27:01,738 --> 00:27:05,991
When Columbus proposed
his journey to discover the New World,

234
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,870
everybody said it was unrealistic.

235
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:11,580
But he succeeded.

236
00:27:11,748 --> 00:27:14,833
He had
the King and Queen of Spain to help him.

237
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:17,711
Who do we have to help us?

238
00:27:17,879 --> 00:27:22,132
I think I might know
someone who can help you.

239
00:27:27,138 --> 00:27:30,099
Can I help you?
- We're looking for these two.

240
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:33,977
Why would Señoritas like that
be way out here?

241
00:27:34,145 --> 00:27:37,439
Found this on a cactus
a half mile down the road.

242
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:41,610
You find any more ofthat,
you can make a nice little hankie.

243
00:27:41,778 --> 00:27:45,364
Would you get your foot out of my door?
- And if I don't?

244
00:27:45,657 --> 00:27:49,034
I'll kill you.
Now, get your sorry ass off this porch.

245
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:53,664
You too.
Fuera! Fuera! Fuera!

246
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:56,667
Come on.

247
00:28:11,851 --> 00:28:14,602
Shut up!
- Hey, does this belong to you?

248
00:28:14,728 --> 00:28:17,313
Thank you.
- Excuse me...

249
00:28:21,527 --> 00:28:23,653
Where are you going?
- Far away.

250
00:28:23,821 --> 00:28:26,656
Guys like that come back with reinforcements.

251
00:28:26,824 --> 00:28:29,617
You said you would help us.
- I just did!

252
00:28:29,785 --> 00:28:32,620
The Padre said you'd teach us to rob banks.

253
00:28:32,788 --> 00:28:35,915
Where did he get that idea?
- You used to do it.

254
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:39,002
You robbed 37 banks and never got caught.

255
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:42,130
37, huh? Last time I go to confession.

256
00:28:42,298 --> 00:28:46,926
Listen, high-minded ideals is one thing,
robbing banks is another.

257
00:28:47,052 --> 00:28:49,888
And neither of you pass the muster.

258
00:28:50,055 --> 00:28:55,185
We're well aware of that.
- That's why we came to you, to learn.

259
00:28:55,352 --> 00:28:57,353
To learn, you need resources.

260
00:28:57,479 --> 00:29:01,900
All you've shown me
is a talent for bringing trouble to my door.

261
00:29:02,276 --> 00:29:04,444
Buena suerte, ladies!

262
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,489
Mr. Buck!

263
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:14,913
You're not going anywhere
until you tell us what we need to know.

264
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,500
If you pull the trigger
the way you're pointing it, it might rain.

265
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,711
You ever fired a pistol?

266
00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:23,922
I have.
- You didn't kill anybody.

267
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:27,258
There's always a first time.
- This ain't it.

268
00:29:32,097 --> 00:29:33,514
Hey!

269
00:29:36,393 --> 00:29:38,102
What are you doing?

270
00:29:42,483 --> 00:29:46,277
Come on! Come on!

271
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:57,330
Get up!

272
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:02,211
Goddamn! Come on!

273
00:30:03,421 --> 00:30:04,505
Come on!

274
00:30:07,342 --> 00:30:08,467
Get up!

275
00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:15,015
What did you do to this horse?
- They killed my father.

276
00:30:15,183 --> 00:30:17,643
And they almost killed mine.

277
00:30:22,065 --> 00:30:24,024
You're breaking my heart.

278
00:30:24,234 --> 00:30:28,195
Alright, no whining,
complaining, or fighting or I'm adios.

279
00:30:28,571 --> 00:30:30,030
I never whine.

280
00:30:30,198 --> 00:30:33,325
Oh, please!
- Oh, please. Well I don't.

281
00:30:33,493 --> 00:30:35,911
Don't.
- Don't hit...

282
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:39,331
Don't you hit me.
- Ladies. Hey!

283
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:41,417
What's it going to be?

284
00:30:45,297 --> 00:30:46,213
Deal!

285
00:30:50,927 --> 00:30:52,845
Alright, you first.

286
00:30:59,853 --> 00:31:02,146
That's pretty good.

287
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:05,316
How many you got left?
- I don't know.

288
00:31:08,236 --> 00:31:09,486
You need to know.

289
00:31:09,738 --> 00:31:13,282
Many a man's died,
for want of an extra bullet.

290
00:31:13,742 --> 00:31:16,577
She's not good with numbers.
- Your turn.

291
00:31:27,422 --> 00:31:29,340
I can't do this.

292
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:33,218
When I'm nervous, I hiccup.
- Guns make you nervous?

293
00:31:33,386 --> 00:31:38,140
What are you going to use to rob banks?
- My education.

294
00:31:38,308 --> 00:31:40,559
My education!
- What's so funny?

295
00:31:40,727 --> 00:31:43,854
To rob a bank!
To rob a bank!

296
00:31:44,022 --> 00:31:46,774
You wish you had one,
you ignorant show-off!

297
00:31:46,941 --> 00:31:51,111
Fort Granger, Oklahoma. US Cavalry.
That's my education.

298
00:31:53,698 --> 00:31:56,909
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

299
00:31:57,285 --> 00:32:01,956
No one moves!
- Get on the floor!

300
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:06,336
How are they going to get on the floor?
I said don't move!

301
00:32:06,504 --> 00:32:10,632
Right. So get on the floor and no one moves!

302
00:32:15,137 --> 00:32:18,139
Sara, I have to tell you something.
- Hold on.

303
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:21,393
This has nothing to do with robbing banks.

304
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,313
Robbing banks is easy.
Getting away is the hard part.

305
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:27,899
Sara!
- How long do we have to do this?

306
00:32:29,235 --> 00:32:30,902
As long as it takes.

307
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:34,697
What?
- I don't think I can hold any longer.

308
00:32:34,865 --> 00:32:37,200
So drop off and swim to the shore.

309
00:32:37,368 --> 00:32:40,161
I can't swim!

310
00:32:49,964 --> 00:32:51,564
Sara!

311
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:13,445
Maria! Hold on to the rock!

312
00:33:42,266 --> 00:33:43,308
Thank you.

313
00:33:43,476 --> 00:33:46,186
For what?
- For saving my life.

314
00:33:46,312 --> 00:33:49,063
You noticed this time.

315
00:33:49,231 --> 00:33:50,273
Good.

316
00:33:54,153 --> 00:33:55,696
Sara?
- What?

317
00:33:55,906 --> 00:33:59,408
I guess...
I guess this makes us friends now.

318
00:34:00,869 --> 00:34:03,078
I don't know about friends.

319
00:34:03,914 --> 00:34:07,541
But partners?

320
00:34:09,503 --> 00:34:11,879
Definitely partners.

321
00:34:21,473 --> 00:34:23,849
Single file.

322
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:26,310
You got to aim the gun.

323
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:27,603
Aim it.

324
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,855
No, higher, higher, higher.

325
00:34:31,441 --> 00:34:32,900
Stinky, I'm sorry!

326
00:34:34,903 --> 00:34:37,571
Come on, go! Faster, faster!

327
00:34:55,715 --> 00:34:58,801
Before you kill your dog,
let's try something.

328
00:34:58,969 --> 00:35:02,221
Take that.
See what you can do with those.

329
00:35:12,691 --> 00:35:14,316
I knew she had talent.

330
00:35:16,403 --> 00:35:20,823
244, 245, 246,

331
00:35:20,991 --> 00:35:24,243
247, 248, 24...

332
00:36:24,472 --> 00:36:28,099
That's the expert?

333
00:36:32,438 --> 00:36:34,105
Mr. Cooke.

334
00:36:34,565 --> 00:36:36,733
Welcome to Mexico.

335
00:36:37,485 --> 00:36:39,694
Clearly, they're amateurs.

336
00:36:39,862 --> 00:36:45,909
Robbing a bank in less than a minute
with no casualties, is pretty professional.

337
00:36:48,245 --> 00:36:51,915
That's odd.
These land transfers they left behind.

338
00:36:52,124 --> 00:36:54,209
Who sells a farm for 1 peso?

339
00:36:54,377 --> 00:36:58,463
The claim is that you're
an expert in criminal science, correct?

340
00:36:58,631 --> 00:37:02,467
Yes.
- Down here I'm the expert in land finance.

341
00:37:02,635 --> 00:37:07,555
Why don't we both just focus
on our respective areas of expertise?

342
00:37:07,765 --> 00:37:10,183
Time's slipping away here.

343
00:37:12,228 --> 00:37:14,854
What's the 1st rule of robbing a bank?

344
00:37:15,189 --> 00:37:17,190
No one gets killed.
- 2nd?

345
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:20,402
Take no more than you can carry in 1 hand.
- 3rd?

346
00:37:20,611 --> 00:37:23,405
Getting away is the 1st rule.
- Perfect.

347
00:37:24,573 --> 00:37:25,865
So, are we ready?

348
00:37:26,534 --> 00:37:30,995
You only needed to know 1 thing all along.
You learned that in the river.

349
00:37:31,163 --> 00:37:33,832
Trust your partner with your life.

350
00:37:35,334 --> 00:37:39,212
Why did you make us do
everything else ifwe were ready?

351
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,757
Well, I kind of liked having you two around.

352
00:37:46,721 --> 00:37:49,222
Now go rob you some banks.

353
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,882
Everybody, hands up!

354
00:38:54,956 --> 00:38:58,292
The room has been
left undisturbed since the death?

355
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,710
Yes.

356
00:39:00,295 --> 00:39:03,130
You've worked here long?
- Almost 20 years.

357
00:39:06,259 --> 00:39:09,303
Did he take medication
for his heart condition?

358
00:39:09,471 --> 00:39:12,681
Don Diego was healthy as a horse.

359
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:14,934
Never sick a day in his life.

360
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,437
Thank you.

361
00:39:18,605 --> 00:39:20,397
If you'll excuse me.

362
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,012
This'll cover the
farms north ofthe river.

363
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,391
I was thinking,
we already have a lot of money.

364
00:39:54,559 --> 00:40:00,021
Maybe we should stop before the regulat...
- They took 10 banks. We take 10 banks.

365
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,357
Right. We still have 5 to go.

366
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:05,402
4.
- That's what I said. 4.

367
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:10,699
But one of my parishioners told me
about a specialist they brought in.

368
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:14,077
A specialist? For us.

369
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,079
I'm afraid, yes.

370
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:20,166
A detective from New York.
- Let him come.

371
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:34,806
Hola. Are you Padre Pablo?
- Yes.

372
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,268
May I come in?
- No.

373
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:43,231
I thought the house of God
was open at all times.

374
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:50,822
It is but God is not at home right now.
He's down the road at the orphanage.

375
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:55,035
Where I was just going.

376
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,370
I'm Quentin Cooke.

377
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,832
I know who you are.

378
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,545
Oh, you do?
- It's my job to know what concerns my flock.

379
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,049
Okay, then maybe you can help me.

380
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:13,720
This girl. Do you think you could tell me...
- No.

381
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:19,184
I didn't finish.
- You want to know if I've seen her.

382
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,354
I'm sure you haven't seen her.

383
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:26,441
Could you tell me
if she had any problems with her father.

384
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:29,736
I loved my father.
Why does he ask this?

385
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:34,574
She loved her father.
Why do you ask such a question?

386
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:38,745
Just the way he died.
Anyway...

387
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:44,794
I'm at the hotel in Santa Rita,
if you have any information.

388
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:56,472
What did he mean about my father's death?
- You heard what I heard.

389
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:02,019
If you want to
know any more, you will have to ask him.

390
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:10,569
Come on. Come...

391
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,671
We can take him right here.

392
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:32,425
What?
- Wonderful. How do we get the information?

393
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:36,220
We ask him.
- Our picture's all over the town.

394
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:44,186
So what? We wear bandanas.
- I have a better plan.

395
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:48,315
Hello, mister, do you want company?

396
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,390
What are you doing?
- Saving time.

397
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:27,688
Yes?

398
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:32,943
Hola!

399
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:40,577
Wrong... room!
- No. We're compliments ofthe management.

400
00:43:41,954 --> 00:43:46,666
She's new.
- I'm sorry, ladies but I have a fiancée.

401
00:43:46,834 --> 00:43:49,461
And we have some questions.
- Hands up!

402
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:53,590
Down!
- Up!

403
00:43:53,758 --> 00:43:57,135
Down!
- Excuse us for a minute.

404
00:43:57,303 --> 00:44:00,639
You've never seen one?
- Yes, but in the dark.

405
00:44:00,807 --> 00:44:02,682
Up!
- My wallet's over there.

406
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:08,230
This is not a robbery.
- Oh my God! You're them!

407
00:44:08,397 --> 00:44:13,610
Yes, it's us.
- You're not getting any answers out of me.

408
00:44:13,778 --> 00:44:16,238
I will not dishonor my profession.

409
00:44:24,038 --> 00:44:26,873
What are you doing?
- We ask the questions.

410
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:31,169
Is this the fiancée? Not bad.

411
00:44:31,337 --> 00:44:35,549
What are you doing?
- Puts me in the mood.

412
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:41,012
Ready?
- Smile!

413
00:44:43,558 --> 00:44:44,933
Mamacita!

414
00:44:48,646 --> 00:44:50,397
Beautiful!

415
00:44:51,566 --> 00:44:54,234
Unless you tell us everything we want,

416
00:44:54,402 --> 00:44:58,446
these pictures will appear
in every paper from here to New York.

417
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,908
With a special set going to your fiancée.

418
00:45:02,535 --> 00:45:06,121
You won't have to worry
about dishonoring your profession.

419
00:45:06,455 --> 00:45:08,874
Because you won't have one.

420
00:45:10,334 --> 00:45:15,130
Now, tell me about my father.
- I'm not telling you anything.

421
00:45:15,298 --> 00:45:19,092
This is a waste oftime.
- Excuse her, she's a bit impetuous.

422
00:45:20,428 --> 00:45:24,222
Mr. Cooke, I'm asking you
as a daughter who lost her father.

423
00:45:30,938 --> 00:45:33,690
Did you father drink wine?
- His passion.

424
00:45:33,941 --> 00:45:36,484
It wasn't a heart attack.
He was poisoned.

425
00:45:38,322 --> 00:45:40,489
How do you know that?
- Science.

426
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:44,577
But you have no right to rob American banks.
- Mexican banks!

427
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:50,374
They're owned by Capitol Bank of New York,
and are protected by American laws.

428
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:56,088
Your country always manages to justify
interfering in other people's affairs.

429
00:45:56,215 --> 00:45:57,506
You break the law.

430
00:45:57,758 --> 00:46:00,092
You're breaking it!
- What?

431
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:03,512
By helping them rob our people.

432
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:05,473
Help! Help!

433
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:15,691
Enough with the hat.
The hat belongs on this head. And that...

434
00:46:16,235 --> 00:46:20,196
That is nothing to be ashamed of.
- Who said I was ashamed?

435
00:46:21,657 --> 00:46:23,783
Have you been with a man?
- Yes.

436
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:26,160
Of course.
- You haven't!

437
00:46:26,328 --> 00:46:29,163
Yes, I have.
- Prove it!

438
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:33,668
Do you want a paper signed by a witness?
- No, kiss him.

439
00:46:34,753 --> 00:46:36,712
What?
- Well...

440
00:46:37,547 --> 00:46:42,176
Kiss a man right, he'll never forget you.
Do it wrong, he won't remember you.

441
00:46:42,344 --> 00:46:44,095
If you've made love,

442
00:46:44,263 --> 00:46:49,100
you know this. If you haven't, you don't.
That's the proof, kiss him.

443
00:46:57,651 --> 00:46:59,944
I have a fianc...

444
00:47:01,655 --> 00:47:02,697
...cée.

445
00:47:05,158 --> 00:47:08,619
Kiss a man like that
and he'll forget you instantly.

446
00:47:08,787 --> 00:47:11,080
Is that what you want?
- No.

447
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:13,124
Watch.

448
00:47:17,045 --> 00:47:19,505
I don't think that...

449
00:47:37,817 --> 00:47:40,944
That's a kiss.
- That's a kiss.

450
00:47:41,112 --> 00:47:43,113
Now you try it.

451
00:47:44,073 --> 00:47:48,952
Come on.
Think ofthe sweetest summer fruit.

452
00:47:54,292 --> 00:47:56,209
Open...

453
00:48:08,806 --> 00:48:11,516
How was that?
- Better.

454
00:48:11,684 --> 00:48:15,395
I thought that was pretty good.
- Yes, technically.

455
00:48:15,563 --> 00:48:18,565
But now...

456
00:48:18,733 --> 00:48:21,943
You have to capture the nuance.

457
00:48:28,826 --> 00:48:30,410
Sara!
- What?

458
00:48:30,787 --> 00:48:32,245
It's 10 to 3.

459
00:48:33,456 --> 00:48:35,040
Sara!
- What?

460
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:37,501
The bank closes at 3.
- Damn.

461
00:48:42,006 --> 00:48:45,300
Where are you taking me?
- You wanted proof.

462
00:48:55,478 --> 00:48:58,897
You already took the money!
- We're not here for that.

463
00:49:00,066 --> 00:49:02,109
Here's your proof.

464
00:49:02,276 --> 00:49:05,153
Who sells a farm for 1 peso?

465
00:49:05,405 --> 00:49:08,532
Who would sell a farm for 1 peso?
- Here.

466
00:49:08,741 --> 00:49:12,077
Check the railroad map.
Look who's the real criminal.

467
00:50:13,348 --> 00:50:16,267
I think there's something you should see.

468
00:50:20,022 --> 00:50:22,356
Tell me you have a plan.
- No.

469
00:50:34,244 --> 00:50:39,540
We have two choices. Run or fight.
- Right, die now or die later?

470
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:42,835
Well, do you have a better idea?
- I do.

471
00:50:45,964 --> 00:50:49,175
Put your guns down or he dies!
- Fine by me.

472
00:50:49,343 --> 00:50:51,511
I said put them down! Now!

473
00:50:51,762 --> 00:50:55,264
He's the boss's son-in-law.

474
00:50:59,228 --> 00:51:01,187
Never mind.

475
00:51:13,283 --> 00:51:16,994
The expert from New York
was kidnapped by the Bandidas.

476
00:51:17,162 --> 00:51:20,122
Excuse me, what?
- Kidnapped by the Bandidas.

477
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,417
How did that happen?

478
00:51:23,585 --> 00:51:26,629
He was in the middle of his investigation,

479
00:51:26,755 --> 00:51:30,842
when two she-monsters
overwhelmed him and took him by force.

480
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:35,264
Oh my god! My poor darling!
Don't tell me they killed him?

481
00:51:40,603 --> 00:51:45,148
Now, I'm out of time here.
And I am completely out of patience.

482
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:50,946
And I would dearly like to see
those two little split-legged bitches dead!

483
00:51:54,659 --> 00:51:55,826
Follow me!

484
00:51:57,245 --> 00:51:58,870
Get in there!

485
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:05,752
We warned you!
Damn, get out of here.

486
00:52:13,928 --> 00:52:15,596
What is this?

487
00:52:16,723 --> 00:52:20,601
It's fingerprint powder.
- What's fingerprint?

488
00:52:23,021 --> 00:52:25,230
See these swirls on your finger?

489
00:52:25,398 --> 00:52:28,900
If you touch something
and I put that powder on it,

490
00:52:29,068 --> 00:52:32,321
I can see your fingerprint,
and I know you were there.

491
00:52:32,572 --> 00:52:36,366
How do you know it's mine?
- No 2 people have the same print.

492
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:43,874
Have you checked everyone in the world?
- No, but it's proven by science.

493
00:52:45,501 --> 00:52:49,046
Doesn't sound very scientific to me.
What's this?

494
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:52,633
That's a microscope.

495
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,179
It helps you see things
that you can't normally see.

496
00:52:59,182 --> 00:53:02,893
Like a thought?
- Yeah. Sort of.

497
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:21,536
I don't see anything.
- Think harder.

498
00:53:23,539 --> 00:53:26,542
Sara, what's wrong?
- What's wrong? Everything.

499
00:53:26,669 --> 00:53:32,048
Jackson's brought in reinforcements.
Real killers. Every bank is guarded now.

500
00:53:32,841 --> 00:53:36,010
They're hunting us.
I'm out of ideas.

501
00:53:36,178 --> 00:53:39,889
I hate to disappoint these people,
but I can't do this.

502
00:53:40,057 --> 00:53:43,768
I think you can.
- Quentin, look at me.

503
00:53:43,936 --> 00:53:47,271
I was raised to be a spoiled lady,
not a renegade.

504
00:53:47,439 --> 00:53:52,735
1 minute I think I have all the answers,
the next I am crying for a manicure.

505
00:53:52,903 --> 00:53:56,864
I am lost out here. Maybe I'm just lost.

506
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:00,535
My mother is gone.
My father is gone.

507
00:54:02,246 --> 00:54:07,792
I have no place in the world.
- Maybe out here is where you belong.

508
00:54:09,169 --> 00:54:13,548
Besides, you're not alone.
- Right.

509
00:54:13,716 --> 00:54:19,721
A gun-happy farm girl, an ugly dog,
a wet-behind-the-ears cop and a spoiled brat.

510
00:54:19,847 --> 00:54:22,056
What a team!

511
00:54:22,224 --> 00:54:25,852
This may seem odd,
having dedicated myselfto the law,

512
00:54:26,019 --> 00:54:31,441
but I think what you are doing here is good.
In fact, I think it's damn noble.

513
00:54:31,608 --> 00:54:35,361
And I'd like to help.

514
00:54:35,487 --> 00:54:37,321
How?

515
00:54:38,866 --> 00:54:40,575
They're after 2 women.

516
00:54:43,495 --> 00:54:48,207
I guess this is what it feels like, huh?
To be married.

517
00:54:49,042 --> 00:54:50,752
Yes.

518
00:54:51,086 --> 00:54:54,797
May I ask you a favor?
- Of course. It's our wedding day.

519
00:54:54,965 --> 00:54:58,134
Can we lose the horse?
It's a little obvious.

520
00:54:58,385 --> 00:55:01,471
Don't disturb him. I need him to concentrate.

521
00:55:03,307 --> 00:55:05,600
You know what you have to do?

522
00:55:09,396 --> 00:55:11,564
Okay. Here we are.

523
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:23,702
It'll never work.

524
00:55:24,204 --> 00:55:26,705
Because she's wearing the wrong shoes.

525
00:55:26,873 --> 00:55:30,542
I'd have done it,
but I'd rather die than wear that dress.

526
00:55:32,712 --> 00:55:35,464
Good day, welcome to our bank!

527
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:40,093
Welcome.
Step in, please.

528
00:55:41,888 --> 00:55:45,766
Your family jewelry will be quite secure.

529
00:55:45,934 --> 00:55:49,394
He takes such good care of me, my Quentin.

530
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:59,947
The slut!
She can't even get the kiss right.

531
00:56:01,115 --> 00:56:03,033
We've got work to do.

532
00:56:06,579 --> 00:56:08,997
She's very excited.

533
00:56:18,383 --> 00:56:23,846
The walls are two feet of poured cement,
reinforced with iron bars.

534
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:30,602
The safe is bolted into the ground,
which is three feet of solid rock.

535
00:56:45,451 --> 00:56:47,619
Did you hear that?
- What?

536
00:56:47,787 --> 00:56:50,414
Sounded like a horse on the roof.

537
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:55,085
I have to ask you a personal question.

538
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:57,838
Do you drink before dinner?
- No.

539
00:56:58,006 --> 00:57:01,842
I was just wondering.
Hearing horses on the roof...

540
00:57:03,928 --> 00:57:08,765
Can we see inside the safe?
- Only if you're ready to make your deposit.

541
00:57:10,476 --> 00:57:11,894
How about for...

542
00:57:12,395 --> 00:57:13,604
withdraws?

543
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:23,907
Great! Just great!
- I didn't know he was going to faint!

544
00:57:24,074 --> 00:57:27,243
These are like megaphones.
Quiet!

545
00:57:29,371 --> 00:57:34,042
Are you sure you can open it with that?
- No, not officially.

546
00:57:34,335 --> 00:57:35,752
Hey!

547
00:57:57,274 --> 00:57:58,816
Can't you go faster?

548
00:57:58,984 --> 00:58:03,071
I'm going as fast
as anyone half deaf can go!

549
00:58:08,911 --> 00:58:11,454
We got you surrounded!

550
00:58:11,872 --> 00:58:14,415
How much longer?

551
00:58:22,549 --> 00:58:25,051
I did it! I did it!

552
00:58:25,636 --> 00:58:26,970
I did it!

553
00:58:34,269 --> 00:58:36,521
Open this damn door!

554
00:58:41,235 --> 00:58:43,152
Fire!

555
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:57,166
You've only got one more chance!
- I know!

556
00:59:14,893 --> 00:59:16,979
They blew the safe.

557
00:59:26,406 --> 00:59:28,741
There it is.

558
00:59:29,534 --> 00:59:31,201
OK, you got it?

559
00:59:31,369 --> 00:59:33,620
Let's go.
- Can I ask you something?

560
00:59:33,788 --> 00:59:36,707
What?
- How was my kiss?

561
00:59:36,833 --> 00:59:38,625
Perfect.

562
01:00:04,152 --> 01:00:07,071
How the hell...

563
01:00:11,659 --> 01:00:13,243
Come on!

564
01:00:32,931 --> 01:00:38,310
Anything wrong, Mr. Jackson?
- Nothing to be concerned about, Governor.

565
01:00:38,478 --> 01:00:40,354
To be honest, Mr. Jackson...

566
01:00:40,522 --> 01:00:45,484
My ministers worry about the safety
of our state's gold deposit in your bank.

567
01:00:45,652 --> 01:00:50,572
They're suggesting we move the gold
to a bank not owned by your company.

568
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:55,160
That gold is as safe
as if it was deposited in my own pocket.

569
01:00:55,328 --> 01:00:58,831
Judging by the success
you had stopping these Bandidas,

570
01:00:59,082 --> 01:01:03,127
you may want to check your pockets.

571
01:01:03,837 --> 01:01:05,879
May I show you something?

572
01:01:09,175 --> 01:01:13,471
This is a prototype of a revolutionary
new system of security devices.

573
01:01:13,639 --> 01:01:16,516
We're installing this in all of our banks.

574
01:01:16,684 --> 01:01:19,602
Including the one that holds your gold. You!

575
01:01:20,729 --> 01:01:21,938
Step on the floor.

576
01:01:24,775 --> 01:01:27,443
Step-o on-o floor-o.

577
01:01:35,494 --> 01:01:37,036
Cut it off!

578
01:01:39,123 --> 01:01:44,043
That floor is fitted with a system
that reacts to the slightest weight change.

579
01:01:44,211 --> 01:01:49,549
Before anyone can reach that safe,
they'll be dead! Dead.

580
01:01:50,551 --> 01:01:54,345
I'm reassured that our gold is in good hands.
- Thank you.

581
01:01:54,471 --> 01:02:00,852
But I'm concerned about people who deposit
money in your bank without the new system.

582
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:06,900
These Bandidas can strike anywhere, anytime.
- May I tell you something in confidence?

583
01:02:07,067 --> 01:02:13,323
Until those new systems are installed,
all the cash will be stored... upstairs.

584
01:02:13,866 --> 01:02:17,118
They'll never get anywhere near it.

585
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:24,250
I'm so sorry.

586
01:02:24,627 --> 01:02:27,420
Her mother was her life.
- I understand.

587
01:02:27,713 --> 01:02:30,173
My daughter is the same way.

588
01:02:30,341 --> 01:02:36,012
She would just die ifthe jewelry her
mother left her, wasn't in the safest place.

589
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:39,682
That's why I brought her here.
- Oh.

590
01:02:39,934 --> 01:02:42,685
Sweetheart, you understand me...

591
01:02:42,853 --> 01:02:46,940
...so well.

592
01:02:56,158 --> 01:02:58,701
She's very upset.

593
01:02:58,869 --> 01:03:01,037
May share a confidence with you?

594
01:03:01,205 --> 01:03:05,208
Today we put in the
most advanced security system ever.

595
01:03:05,376 --> 01:03:09,671
Oh, can we see it?
- Sorry, no one can see it.

596
01:03:28,024 --> 01:03:30,734
We can't do it.
- Yes, we can.

597
01:03:30,902 --> 01:03:34,802
The only place not covered
by the alarm is 1 inch on the seam.

598
01:03:34,876 --> 01:03:37,174
How
would you get across?

599
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:40,077
Her education.

600
01:03:40,453 --> 01:03:42,246
At least I have one.

601
01:03:42,414 --> 01:03:46,667
And what will you use to open the vault?
- The key.

602
01:04:06,855 --> 01:04:08,022
Nice shot.

603
01:04:08,189 --> 01:04:09,815
Thanks.
- What's this?

604
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:14,194
Careful! It's dipped in poison
made from South American tree bark.

605
01:04:14,404 --> 01:04:18,324
The Indians use it to hunt.
It puts the animal to sleep.

606
01:04:18,491 --> 01:04:20,659
Use this if you have a problem.

607
01:04:21,286 --> 01:04:23,078
Okay, go!

608
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:30,669
I got it.
- Okay, okay.

609
01:04:41,473 --> 01:04:43,307
Go!

610
01:04:46,978 --> 01:04:48,562
Come on!
- Okay.

611
01:05:36,487 --> 01:05:38,780
Calm down.

612
01:06:08,644 --> 01:06:10,311
Sorry.

613
01:06:33,544 --> 01:06:34,586
Great.

614
01:06:38,883 --> 01:06:41,384
When were you last on these?
- I was 10.

615
01:06:41,677 --> 01:06:43,887
Great.
- Don't worry, I can do it.

616
01:06:44,221 --> 01:06:46,848
No need to rush.
Don't take any chances.

617
01:06:47,016 --> 01:06:48,808
Stay calm.

618
01:06:49,435 --> 01:06:52,562
Don't be nervous.
- You're making me nervous.

619
01:06:58,652 --> 01:07:01,112
What's wrong?
- I need to be calm.

620
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,908
Yes, you're right. Calm down.

621
01:07:10,916 --> 01:07:13,542
Okay, I'm calm now.
- Me too.

622
01:07:19,966 --> 01:07:22,635
How was my kiss?

623
01:07:22,802 --> 01:07:25,763
Perfect.
- I knew it.

624
01:07:39,444 --> 01:07:42,613
Do you really have to sing?
- Yes!

625
01:07:42,739 --> 01:07:45,032
It puts me in the mood.
- Okay.

626
01:08:08,265 --> 01:08:10,975
Bravo!

627
01:08:15,897 --> 01:08:19,733
Santa Maria!
- Oh my...

628
01:08:20,986 --> 01:08:25,739
I'm gonna go check the vault.
- I'll stick that banjo up your...

629
01:08:25,907 --> 01:08:28,075
I'm tired ofthat banjo.

630
01:08:32,289 --> 01:08:36,333
Hey, what's the matter with you?
You alright?

631
01:08:43,592 --> 01:08:47,303
More fire for the wood.
More wood for the fire.

632
01:08:57,564 --> 01:09:00,691
Tequila must be pretty good, down here.

633
01:09:03,571 --> 01:09:05,196
Sara!

634
01:09:05,364 --> 01:09:08,742
Hurry up!
- I'm doing my best.

635
01:09:14,832 --> 01:09:16,416
Everything calm?
- Yeah.

636
01:09:27,011 --> 01:09:30,680
What are you doing?
- I was taught to finish what I start.

637
01:09:30,848 --> 01:09:34,309
If I'm going to rob a bank
I'm going to do it properly.

638
01:09:35,686 --> 01:09:39,189
You damn idiot,
what are you doin' with my gun?

639
01:09:44,403 --> 01:09:46,237
Okay, slow, slow, slow.

640
01:09:46,739 --> 01:09:51,743
Who are you calling a damn idiot?
I ain't no damn idiot!

641
01:09:54,413 --> 01:09:57,374
Come on. Come on.

642
01:09:58,542 --> 01:10:00,293
Shut up!
- Stop.

643
01:10:00,878 --> 01:10:03,129
Don't move.

644
01:10:16,644 --> 01:10:18,269
Quentin!

645
01:10:21,691 --> 01:10:23,316
Hold it.

646
01:10:30,324 --> 01:10:31,449
Hold it!

647
01:10:32,451 --> 01:10:33,910
Quentin!

648
01:10:34,078 --> 01:10:35,537
Sara!

649
01:10:36,872 --> 01:10:38,331
Come on, let's go!

650
01:10:40,543 --> 01:10:42,085
Go! Go! Go!

651
01:10:58,353 --> 01:11:01,105
Party's over!

652
01:11:03,525 --> 01:11:10,406
Looks like we're about to start the party.
You may want to do some last rights, Padre.

653
01:11:15,996 --> 01:11:20,166
You can't even do
a simple thing like stare at the street!

654
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:23,669
You were supposed to be looking out!
- I was.

655
01:11:23,795 --> 01:11:28,090
If you had, we wouldn't be here.
- Well, if you weren't so greedy...

656
01:11:28,258 --> 01:11:32,845
You are inefficient and unprofessional.
I saw those kisses at the bank.

657
01:11:33,013 --> 01:11:36,098
That's what brides do.
And don't play innocent.

658
01:11:36,266 --> 01:11:38,642
You stuck your tongue down his throat.

659
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:42,396
Brides don't
smell like horses and kiss like chickens.

660
01:11:42,564 --> 01:11:44,774
I was a widow in need of comfort.

661
01:11:44,941 --> 01:11:49,153
Well, he said my kiss was perfect.
- Well, for your information...

662
01:11:49,321 --> 01:11:55,659
I'm sick of both of you fighting over kisses
when the future of your country is at stake!

663
01:11:56,036 --> 01:12:01,499
What am I doing? You're not serious. You're
silly girls playing with thousands of lives.

664
01:12:01,666 --> 01:12:07,087
A spoiled brat and a farm hand.
Do you think you're changing history?

665
01:12:07,255 --> 01:12:13,260
What was I thinking? Throwing away
my life and my career! And for what?

666
01:12:13,428 --> 01:12:19,016
You know what's sad? No one will care,
nothing will have changed because we're dead!

667
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:44,625
Viva!

668
01:12:46,419 --> 01:12:50,881
I might not know who I am,
but I know who I'm not.

669
01:12:51,216 --> 01:12:53,968
I'm not someone who'll
let her country down!

670
01:12:54,511 --> 01:12:57,305
Viva Mexico!

671
01:12:58,099 --> 01:13:03,520
Viva Mexico! Viva la Revolución!

672
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:06,690
Governor, I have good news and bad news.

673
01:13:06,858 --> 01:13:10,110
My people were able
to save a portion ofthe money.

674
01:13:10,778 --> 01:13:14,239
We even had both Bandidas in custody.

675
01:13:14,407 --> 01:13:18,285
The bad news is, your people freed them!

676
01:13:20,788 --> 01:13:27,085
I must apologize to you. I didn't expect
the situation to become so unstable.

677
01:13:27,461 --> 01:13:33,091
Your help has been invaluable.
Now I'm hoping you have a solution.

678
01:13:33,259 --> 01:13:37,679
Rest assured, the Capitol Bank
and Trust of New York has a solution.

679
01:13:37,847 --> 01:13:42,601
They're moving the gold reserve to Texas.
- What does it mean?

680
01:13:42,768 --> 01:13:45,186
It means it's over. He figured it out.

681
01:13:45,771 --> 01:13:48,273
Figured what out?
- How to beat us.

682
01:13:48,608 --> 01:13:53,069
We're beating him!
We're strong enough to take the other banks.

683
01:13:53,613 --> 01:13:58,116
So, let him have the gold.
We'll have all the money!

684
01:13:58,284 --> 01:14:03,163
Maria, the money is just paper.
It represents the value ofthe gold.

685
01:14:03,331 --> 01:14:09,586
It's the basis of the entire monetary system.
Without the gold, the paper has no value.

686
01:14:10,254 --> 01:14:12,547
Then we should rob the gold.

687
01:14:16,052 --> 01:14:17,469
What's wrong?

688
01:14:22,475 --> 01:14:25,226
Shut that and lock it.
- Yeah, right away.

689
01:14:34,028 --> 01:14:38,198
You know, this might be
the last time we get to talk.

690
01:14:38,366 --> 01:14:44,329
Don't say that, it's bad luck.
I'm a suspicious peasant, remember?

691
01:14:44,497 --> 01:14:48,166
No, you're a lot more than that.

692
01:14:48,376 --> 01:14:52,922
You always know what you want
and you always know what you feel.

693
01:14:55,592 --> 01:14:56,884
I admire you.

694
01:15:01,014 --> 01:15:07,561
You admire me? How can you admire me?
All I know about is horses and chickens.

695
01:15:07,729 --> 01:15:11,399
Well, now I also know
how to really give a good kiss.

696
01:15:19,366 --> 01:15:21,909
You've been a good partner.

697
01:15:27,874 --> 01:15:29,625
You've been a good friend.

698
01:15:31,670 --> 01:15:35,047
You've taught me a lot
about caring about people.

699
01:15:44,266 --> 01:15:50,896
And you were... you were a beautiful widow.
- Well, black is always a flattering color.

700
01:15:51,064 --> 01:15:53,482
I'd like to get something off my chest.

701
01:15:55,777 --> 01:16:01,282
This bloody corset.
It's been squeezing my gut my whole life.

702
01:16:16,757 --> 01:16:19,300
Thank you so much for making the effort.

703
01:16:19,468 --> 01:16:22,553
Mr. Governor,
it's not an effort, it's an honor.

704
01:16:22,721 --> 01:16:26,724
You wanted me here
to show our support for your plan. Here I am.

705
01:16:27,517 --> 01:16:32,396
Señorita Clarissa, thank you
for gracing ourjourney with your beauty.

706
01:16:32,564 --> 01:16:36,400
I wish I could be better company.
I'm so nervous about Quentin.

707
01:16:36,568 --> 01:16:38,569
Is there any word?
- Mr. Jackson?

708
01:16:39,404 --> 01:16:43,407
I wouldn't be surprised
if your man was by your side real soon.

709
01:16:43,575 --> 01:16:45,701
Really?
- Really?

710
01:16:45,869 --> 01:16:48,496
If you'll excuse us, miss. Gentlemen.

711
01:16:48,664 --> 01:16:50,916
Did you hear that?
- Every word.

712
01:16:51,375 --> 01:16:56,004
It's sad that my nation's wealth
must be protected by another country.

713
01:16:56,172 --> 01:16:59,841
Sir, you're acting
in your people's best interests.

714
01:17:00,009 --> 01:17:03,720
Governor, I'd like for you
to review our security measures.

715
01:17:03,930 --> 01:17:07,265
Of course. Excuse me.
- Yes, yes, certainly.

716
01:17:07,433 --> 01:17:11,436
Mr. Jackson,
was my trip down here really necessary?

717
01:17:11,604 --> 01:17:13,772
Mr. Ashe.

718
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:18,985
In order to get that gold released,
the governor needed a show of confidence.

719
01:17:19,153 --> 01:17:21,238
In order to catch those 2 women,

720
01:17:21,405 --> 01:17:25,117
I need that gold on board.
- Catch them! What do you mean?

721
01:17:25,284 --> 01:17:29,246
The walls have ears in Mexico.
So I whispered into them.

722
01:17:29,413 --> 01:17:31,164
That gold is my bait.

723
01:17:31,332 --> 01:17:34,918
The fish are on board, I guarantee you that.
- Good God!

724
01:17:35,086 --> 01:17:40,924
Once we get to Texas our law takes effect.
They'll be hanged by sundown.

725
01:17:41,134 --> 01:17:45,053
Hanging someone
without a fair trial is not our law.

726
01:17:45,221 --> 01:17:48,974
Oh it will be. As soon as those two pop up.

727
01:18:00,862 --> 01:18:04,197
There's no security out here, Mr. Jackson.

728
01:18:04,407 --> 01:18:08,827
Oh, but quite to the contrary, Governor.
Indeed there is.

729
01:18:08,995 --> 01:18:11,454
Security for my old age.

730
01:18:11,622 --> 01:18:14,541
Your gold. Or rather should I say, my gold.

731
01:18:14,709 --> 01:18:17,711
I'm not following you.
- No, sir, you're not.

732
01:18:21,048 --> 01:18:23,925
What is that?
- What do you think it is?

733
01:18:24,093 --> 01:18:27,679
You'll shoot one of us.
- Thanks for your confidence.

734
01:18:27,847 --> 01:18:31,683
I'm just being realistic.
- You realistic? That's a first.

735
01:18:31,851 --> 01:18:38,023
You shooting a gun? That's a first.
- Could we just stick to robbing the train?

736
01:18:42,069 --> 01:18:45,865
If they don't smell like soup in here,
my damn nose is broke.

737
01:18:47,993 --> 01:18:50,328
Oh my my my, black beans!

738
01:18:56,752 --> 01:18:57,960
Bandidas! Bandidas!

739
01:19:30,118 --> 01:19:32,828
Where's the governor?
- Stretching his legs.

740
01:19:32,996 --> 01:19:34,080
How do you mean?

741
01:19:34,873 --> 01:19:36,958
He fell off the train.
- Daddy?

742
01:19:37,167 --> 01:19:38,960
What's going on?
- Look,

743
01:19:39,086 --> 01:19:41,671
We had 60 days to lock up the railroads.

744
01:19:41,838 --> 01:19:47,260
When I saw that because of those bitches
we were going to lose that opportunity,

745
01:19:47,427 --> 01:19:52,348
I decided, why not
take advantage ofthe situation, if I could?

746
01:19:52,516 --> 01:19:56,352
You're stealing the gold?
- Yes sir, I am.

747
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:59,605
Stop this train, right now!
- No, sir. I won't.

748
01:19:59,773 --> 01:20:02,984
I am not a thief.
I will have no part of this!

749
01:20:03,151 --> 01:20:05,861
I don't believe I offered you a part.
- No!

750
01:20:07,698 --> 01:20:09,824
No one moves!
- Hands up!

751
01:20:09,992 --> 01:20:12,159
Daddy!
- Don't move!

752
01:20:13,328 --> 01:20:15,162
Turn around!

753
01:20:15,330 --> 01:20:17,290
You Okay?
- Now see here!

754
01:20:17,457 --> 01:20:21,210
I said turn around!
You! Drop the gun!

755
01:20:23,088 --> 01:20:27,842
You're playing a losing hand.
I got men all over this goddamn train.

756
01:20:28,010 --> 01:20:29,677
Guess again!

757
01:20:30,971 --> 01:20:34,432
You won't get away with this.
- You're the one who won't!

758
01:20:34,599 --> 01:20:38,853
Killing and robbing our people is over!
- What does she mean?

759
01:20:39,021 --> 01:20:42,273
He murdered my father!
- You ain't got no proof.

760
01:20:42,441 --> 01:20:46,236
We have fingerprints and litmus paper.
- We have a microscope!

761
01:20:46,404 --> 01:20:49,740
What are you talking about?
- The scientific method!

762
01:20:50,241 --> 01:20:54,828
Quentin!

763
01:20:54,996 --> 01:20:59,374
What are you doing here?

764
01:21:47,298 --> 01:21:48,465
God!

765
01:21:50,551 --> 01:21:52,010
Get out of my way!

766
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:58,475
What are you doing? Come on!
- He shot you!

767
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:30,215
God dammit!

768
01:23:01,915 --> 01:23:05,251
Where are you going?
Are you letting him get away?

769
01:23:17,514 --> 01:23:19,932
Is he dead?
- If he's not he will be.

770
01:23:20,726 --> 01:23:24,228
Should we hold him for the law?
- He killed your father!

771
01:23:24,396 --> 01:23:28,941
I know.
I want to kill him. I dream of killing him.

772
01:23:29,818 --> 01:23:33,529
But if I do,
that makes me no better than him.

773
01:23:34,156 --> 01:23:35,990
Maria.

774
01:23:38,410 --> 01:23:44,040
I don't think I can kill a man.
- Me, neither.

775
01:23:48,295 --> 01:23:51,130
But I'm going to anyway.
- Just wound him.

776
01:23:53,592 --> 01:23:56,886
Will this give me a bad reputation,
shooting people?

777
01:23:57,054 --> 01:24:00,431
No, it would just add to your legend.

778
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:05,561
I have a legend?
- Of course we do.

779
01:24:15,739 --> 01:24:17,990
Always count your bullets.

780
01:24:18,534 --> 01:24:21,619
Adios, Señoritas!

781
01:24:45,603 --> 01:24:50,524
He was enlisted to uncover the real Bandido.
- He helped to fix our country.

782
01:24:50,692 --> 01:24:55,529
So we honor him for bravery
above and beyond the call of duty.

783
01:24:55,697 --> 01:24:58,740
And for his service to the people of Mexico.

784
01:24:58,950 --> 01:25:03,704
And for helping to bring our people together.
- I'm going to miss you.

785
01:25:09,544 --> 01:25:11,587
I'm going to miss you.

786
01:25:22,098 --> 01:25:29,187
I too wish to express my appreciation.
Now, if you please, get on the train.

787
01:25:31,649 --> 01:25:33,442
I...

788
01:25:33,818 --> 01:25:36,612
better go.

789
01:25:47,165 --> 01:25:50,292
I can't believe you made it all work out.

790
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:54,004
I'm so happy.

791
01:26:12,065 --> 01:26:14,399
She's not a very good kisser.

792
01:26:14,567 --> 01:26:19,363
Well, she is,
but you're much better, much better.

793
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:31,333
I can't believe the way he was kissing her.
So insincere. Such a liar!

794
01:26:31,959 --> 01:26:34,692
Telling me my kiss was perfect.
Then you.

795
01:26:34,693 --> 01:26:37,423
I'm sure he's telling
her the same thing.

796
01:26:37,966 --> 01:26:39,509
What do you think?

797
01:26:40,844 --> 01:26:42,512
Sara!
- What?

798
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:46,933
Isn't it obvious he doesn't love her?
- Is that why you woke me up?

799
01:26:48,519 --> 01:26:52,271
I was having such a nice sleep.
- At least you can sleep.

800
01:26:52,439 --> 01:26:56,567
I could sleep before I met you.
Now, I can't stop thinking.

801
01:26:56,735 --> 01:27:00,029
You should be grateful
that now your brain is thinking.

802
01:27:00,823 --> 01:27:06,119
Please be quiet so I can enjoy the sunset.
- You've never seen a sunset before?

803
01:27:06,787 --> 01:27:11,582
This sunset reminds me of
a particularly beautiful one I saw in Cadiz.

804
01:27:13,210 --> 01:27:18,214
Where's that?
- Cadiz? In Europe.

805
01:27:18,382 --> 01:27:21,217
Can I ask you one more thing?
- One more.

806
01:27:23,804 --> 01:27:26,431
How are the banks in Europe?

807
01:27:31,854 --> 01:27:33,730
Bigger.

808
01:27:47,509 --> 01:27:50,509
