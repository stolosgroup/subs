Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

To all those whose brains will
decompose before their hearts

4
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,679
Everything's ready.

5
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,519
Ok.

6
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,839
Some wine?

7
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
Yes.

8
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,239
Stop!

9
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
Thanks.

10
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,599
Cheers.

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,399
Life's a dream, isn't it?

12
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Yes.

13
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,799
A dream within a dream.

14
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
To us.

15
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,559
To us.

<i>We are so very little.</i>

00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,559
<i>My friend the rose</i>

18
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,519
<i>told me so this morning.</i>

19
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,039
<i>I was born at dawn</i>

20
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,679
<i>baptised with dew.</i>

21
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,519
<i>I bloomed</i>

22
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,399
<i>happy and in love,</i>

23
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,239
<i>in the sun's rays.</i>

24
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,959
<i>I closed myself at night</i>

25
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,119
<i>and woke up old.</i>

26
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,279
<i>Yet I was so beautiful,</i>

27
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,239
<i>the most beautiful</i>

28
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,279
<i>flower in your garden.</i>

29
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,879
<i>We are so very little.</i>

30
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,999
<i>My friend the rose</i>

31
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,679
<i>told me so this morning.</i>

32
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,919
<i>The God who made me</i>

33
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,959
<i>bows my head</i>

34
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,439
<i>and I feel I am falling,</i>

35
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,559
<i>falling</i>

36
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,959
<i>My heart is almost bare.</i>

37
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,279
<i>I've one foot in the grave.</i>

38
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,919
<i>I'm already gone.</i>

39
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,999
<i>You admired me yesterday</i>

40
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,439
<i>and I will be dust</i>

41
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,799
<i>tomorrow for good.</i>

42
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,159
<i>We are so very little.</i>

43
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,119
<i>My friend the rose</i>

44
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,039
<i>died this morning.</i>

45
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,879
<i>The moon tonight</i>

46
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,999
<i>watched over my friend.</i>

47
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,039
<i>In my dreams I saw,</i>

48
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,239
<i>dazzling and bare,</i>

49
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,639
<i>her soul dancing</i>

50
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,839
<i>beyond the clouds</i>

51
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,919
<i>and smiling down on me.</i>

52
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,439
<i>Believe he who can believe,</i>

53
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,479
<i>I need to hope</i>

54
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,319
<i>or I am nothing.</i>

55
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,839
<i>Or else I am so very little,</i>

56
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,039
<i>as my friend the rose</i>

57
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,639
<i>told me yesterday.</i>

58
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,839
<i>...we will discuss the grieving process,</i>

59
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,599
<i>the importance of rituals,</i>

60
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,159
<i>the notion of resilience,</i>

61
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,199
<i>post-mourning awareness</i>

62
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,159
<i>and subjective experiences
of contact with the deceased.</i>

63
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,639
<i>Our guests are joined by</i>

64
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,239
<i>Dr Boris Cyrulnik, neuropsychiatrist,</i>

65
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,119
<i>essayist and ethologist.</i>

66
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,439
<i>Dr Chris top he Fauré,</i>

67
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,359
<i>psychiatrist and psychotherapist,</i>

68
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,479
<i>and journalist Stéphane Allix,</i>

69
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,879
<i>author, founder of the Institute
on Extraordinary Experiences.</i>

70
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,399
<i>Chris top he Fauré discusses
the grieving process.</i>

71
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,479
<i>The grieving process
is the natural, intelligent process</i>

72
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,959
<i>intrinsic to our being,</i>

73
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,759
<i>that accompanies the healing
of the violent, brutal wound</i>

74
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,759
<i>caused by death.</i>

75
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,839
<i>It will</i>

76
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,159
<i>heal the wound</i>

77
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,221
<i>and let us go from an
external, objective bond</i>

78
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:06,814
<i>with the person we could hear,</i>

79
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,919
<i>see, talk to and hug,</i>

80
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,519
<i>to a subjective internal bond,</i>

81
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,399
<i>where we never lose them.</i>

82
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,159
<i>The opposite of oblivion.</i>

83
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,159
<i>On the contrary,
it's called introjectlon.</i>

84
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,999
<i>Internalisation of the
loved one's presence, forever.</i>

85
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,578
<i>If you're close to someone
who's lost a loved one.</i>

86
00:09:29,711 --> 00:09:31,589
<i>And you feel helpless or awkward,</i>

87
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,759
<i>Dr Fauré stresses the importance</i>

88
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,119
<i>of opening up a dialogue,</i>

89
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,759
<i>not leaving things unspoken.</i>

90
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,879
<i>Asking about their
bonds with the deceased,</i>

91
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,194
<i>how they died,</i>

92
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,719
<i>evoking memories</i>

93
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,119
<i>or saying their name
helps the griever maintain interaction,</i>

94
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,559
<i>favouring the integration process.</i>

95
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,199
<i>The grieving process is
accompanied by rituals.</i>

96
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
<i>Boris Cyrulnik:</i>

97
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,039
<i>we cannot leave to rot on the ground</i>

98
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,919
<i>the body of someone we still love,</i>

99
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,079
<i>who lives on in our heart, our mind.</i>

100
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,919
<i>We love someone who has gone.</i>

101
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,999
<i>We need to invent a grave.</i>

102
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,119
<i>We've done it since Neanderthal times:</i>

103
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,639
<i>the body is laid in a meaningful position,</i>

104
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,039
<i>flower petals are thrown,</i>

105
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,639
<i>food is deposited for the
journey to the afterlife.</i>

106
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,119
<i>Tears are shed.</i>

107
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,479
<i>Mr and Mrs Neanderthal
knew how to speak,</i>

108
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,639
<i>I imagine they must have
spoken like today.</i>

109
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,839
<i>When we lose someone,
a loved one,</i>

110
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,999
<i>we carve their name in stone.</i>

111
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,479
<i>Carving the name
keeps them alive.</i>

112
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,719
<i>We put their photo on a tombstone,</i>

113
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,599
<i>lay flowers around it,</i>

114
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,439
<i>keeping them alive in our memory,</i>

115
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,919
<i>when we know
they are really dead.</i>

116
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,959
<i>So, the grieving ritual...</i>

117
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,319
<i>Every culture
has a grieving ritual.</i>

118
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,279
<i>It gives the deceased dignity,</i>

119
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,894
<i>and us too,</i>

120
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:45,039
<i>for if we left the loved one's body
to rot on the ground</i>

121
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,759
<i>we would be ashamed.</i>

122
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,119
<i>We have to make a tomb</i>

123
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,679
<i>and we have to perform a social ritual.</i>

124
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,279
<i>We cry, but we are together,</i>

125
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,439
<i>it gives the death meaning.</i>

126
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,599
<i>Our first response was</i>

127
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,399
<i>the tomb as an artwork.</i>

128
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,879
<i>Egyptians made artworks,</i>

129
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,959
<i>we are still unearthing them.</i>

130
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,759
<i>It's interesting for the
universal human condition:</i>

131
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,519
<i>the representation of death.</i>

132
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,599
<i>It differs from the perception
of a dead person.</i>

133
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,599
<i>A dead body is a corpse,
death is a spirituality.</i>

134
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,759
<i>In Western society,
it has been kept at a distance,</i>

135
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,159
<i>as have the rituals,
traditions and social codes</i>

136
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,399
<i>that go with the loss of a loved one.</i>

137
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,319
<i>To what end?</i>

138
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,879
<i>It's linked to technological progress,</i>

139
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,239
<i>which has been beneficial.</i>

140
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,119
<i>But in the 50s and 60s,</i>

141
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,999
<i>accompanying death</i>

142
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,119
<i>moved away from the home.</i>

143
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,239
<i>The ancestral practices</i>

144
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,079
<i>...but which put death
at a distance from society.</i>

145
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,399
<i>It's become medical.</i>

146
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,679
<i>Care lies with technicians, experts,</i>

147
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,719
<i>and we have removed it from society.</i>

148
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,239
<i>It's hidden in hospitals</i>

149
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,919
Don't!

150
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,719
Thanks.

151
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,639
Can I help you?

152
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,319
Toys...?

153
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,959
Down on the right.

154
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,799
<i>...and then,
their brains function again.</i>

155
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,319
<i>If they are not reassured
the brain is side rated,</i>

156
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,359
<i>the brain scan shows
it no longer works.</i>

157
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,879
<i>So, they need to be reassured</i>

158
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,039
<i>and that done,
they need to be encouraged</i>

159
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,479
<i>to make sense of
what has happened.</i>

160
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,039
<i>They need to talk,</i>

161
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,999
<i>speech becomes affective:</i>

162
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,879
<i>emotions are triggered by speaking.</i>

163
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,199
<i>It makes sense:</i>

164
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,679
<i>why has this happened?</i>

165
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,159
<i>How to move forward?</i>

166
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,919
<i>It's biological and psychological.</i>

167
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,279
<i>You differentiate traumatic memory</i>

168
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,560
<i>and healthy memory.</i>

169
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,159
<i>How does that work?</i>

170
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,959
<i>Healthy memory is progressive.</i>

171
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,862
<i>We keep reorganising</i>

172
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,039
<i>the memory of what happened.</i>

173
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,359
<i>It's not the past returning.</i>

174
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,399
<i>It's the representation of the past,</i>

175
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,399
<i>our notion of what happened.</i>

176
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,239
<i>It shifts with time and people.</i>

177
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,399
<i>We don't see things
as we did before.</i>

178
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,359
<i>Inevitably, as we age,</i>

179
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,839
<i>our childhood memories</i>

180
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,759
<i>are not as vivid as when
we were teens.</i>

181
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,359
<i>The representation of our past shifts.</i>

182
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,399
Did you find it?

183
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,119
<i>Memory of past events change.</i>

184
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,119
<i>That is healthy memory,</i>

185
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,599
<i>it evolves.</i>

186
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,679
<i>Traumatic memory is trapped,
it stops moving.</i>

187
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,680
Vuk?

188
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,559
Coming!

189
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
You there?

190
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,920
There you are!

191
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,639
Have you seen my wife?

192
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,519
Not at all.

193
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,959
Was she here?

194
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,359
Was she here?

195
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,559
Not today.

196
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,479
If you see her

197
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,919
tell her I'm looking for her.

198
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,799
Ok.

199
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,999
It's good you came,
I found you a book or two

200
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,679
...for your work.

201
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,799
Hang on.

202
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
What is it?

203
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,479
They're on symbolism and dreams.

204
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,279
It all ties in

205
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,159
with your work.

206
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,399
Yeah, my book.

207
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,239
It's going well?

208
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,759
Yes, but... I have to find my wife.

209
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,959
Shall I keep them?

210
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,479
Yes

211
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,399
I won't be at the meeting,

212
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,199
too much work.

213
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,279
But I'll call you

214
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,393
If I see her,
I'll say you're looking for her.

215
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,119
Thank you.

216
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,479
Take care!

217
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
Thanks.

218
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,039
Have you seen my wife?

219
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,199
Down the back.

220
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,959
Sir! She's here

221
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,719
Where were you?

222
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,839
I looked everywhere.

223
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
All over.

224
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,160
Why?

225
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,599
Let's go home.

226
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
You like it?

227
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,359
How much?

228
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
5 euros.

229
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,239
Here, for you.

230
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,120
Thanks.

231
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,120
Come home.

232
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,399
Bye.

233
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,559
Be careful.

234
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,160
Come

235
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,840
Careful.

236
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
Yes

237
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,640
What did you do?

238
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Nothing!

239
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,559
You went out,

240
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,479
left the door open

241
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,959
and no-one knew where you went

242
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,839
Where have you been?

243
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,691
I was at the pharmacy

244
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,880
No.

245
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,999
That's a lie.

246
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,559
Impossible, I went there.

247
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,319
I talked to everyone...

248
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,199
who works there.

249
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,799
They all know you.

250
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,479
And no-one saw you.

251
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,399
You didn't go there!

252
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,559
Stop scaring me.

253
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,359
You're scaring me!

254
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,240
How?

255
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,199
That you'll get lost,

256
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,439
in the city...

257
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,959
attacked by a thug,

258
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,240
a dealer,

259
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,839
it's a dangerous city.

260
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,559
No

261
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,439
Yes, it is.

262
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,559
And you swan around it

263
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,439
It scares me!

264
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
People are kind.

265
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,040
No!

266
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,999
You think so

267
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,679
but they're not.

268
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,479
They're horrible!

269
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,759
The world is full of madmen

270
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,439
and horrible people.

271
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,879
Full of them!

272
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,079
Understand?

273
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,039
I don't believe it.

274
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,359
It's the truth.

275
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,559
No, it's not.

276
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,759
I've made my point...

277
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,599
So, you'll stop?

278
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,440
You'll kill me.

279
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,519
No.

280
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,079
I don't want to hurt you

281
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,159
I'll be ok

282
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,119
I have to work,

283
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,959
write my book

284
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,599
it's important.

285
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,999
Very.

286
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,119
It's about films

287
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,119
and dreams.

288
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,879
It's an important book.

289
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,879
Please, really

290
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,519
Please...

291
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,799
Really... ok?

292
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,519
Thank you.

293
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,519
Please call me back.

294
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,199
Really

295
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
Thanks.

296
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,679
Claire, answer...

297
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,160
answer me...

298
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,879
Please

299
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,879
I need to talk to you.

300
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,719
I need...

301
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,879
to hear your voice.

302
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
Please.

303
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,560
Claire

304
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,239
Hi, Jean-Baptiste?

305
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,319
It's me, yes.

306
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,640
You ok?

307
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,079
I need you.

308
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,319
You know, I'm writing a book

309
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,760
on film

310
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,880
and dreams.

311
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,359
I've already come up with a title:

312
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,680
"Psyche"

313
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,320
You like it

314
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,400
I'm glad.

315
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,799
And also, I found a line,

316
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,959
a great line by Edgar Allan Poe:

317
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,959
"Is all that we see or seem...

318
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:53,519
Is all that we see
but a dream within a dream?"

319
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,399
It's grandiose.

320
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,279
I wanted to put that line

321
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,959
at the start.

322
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,679
Yes, true.

323
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,399
No doubt

324
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,959
I also think that

325
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,159
cinema,

326
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,719
I mean a movie theatre,

327
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,919
is the greatest,
most appropriate atmosphere

328
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,799
to...

329
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,719
to expose our dreams,

330
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,159
to tell them,

331
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,159
because it's...

332
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,680
it's all dark,

333
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,959
you have no contact with anyone.

334
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,799
It's like being in bed,

335
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,040
sleeping,

336
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,240
dreaming.

337
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,119
Cinema is that.

338
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,719
A big dream.

339
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,279
All cinema.

340
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,359
Not just films about dreams.

341
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,399
All films are dreams.

342
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
Yes.

343
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,399
Yes, the line I wrote

344
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,679
"The dreamer is awake", yes

345
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,999
Sure, I'll ask my publisher
if he likes it.

346
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,519
I think in a movie theatre,
when the spectators dream,

347
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,879
they don't see the dream,

348
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,439
they see some symbols.

349
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,599
Sometimes.

350
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:18,999
But most are in a state of...

351
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,799
continual relaxation

352
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,959
like they were

353
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,240
in a dream.

354
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,519
Caught in a situation,

355
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,719
a wonderful situation,

356
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,480
with things

357
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,639
that are in the sky.

358
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,959
Symbols, as Freud said.

359
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Like the sea...

360
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,999
it's your mother,

361
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,559
but also means

362
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,040
sex.

363
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,799
Big sex...

364
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,399
when you dream of the ocean!

365
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,399
Huge sex!

366
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,399
Huge sensuality.

367
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,839
That's true.

368
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,919
Sometimes

369
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,559
I can't say I've never dreamed

370
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,760
I dream!

371
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,639
But not always the way Fellini did,
or Mizoguchi...

372
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,599
That's true, very true.

373
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,719
It's really...

374
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,959
the core issue.

375
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,240
Bravo.

376
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,440
Ok.

377
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,919
Talk soon.

378
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,720
Ciao.

379
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,159
Stéphane, can you come?

380
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,120
Stéphane?

381
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,079
Mum, have you called Nathalie?

382
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,920
Nathalie?

383
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,319
Yes, Nathalie.

384
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,479
Your assistant, your former assistant.

385
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,479
You didn't call?

386
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,079
No, she didn't.

387
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,065
Did you?

388
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,119
No, I didn't because...

389
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,879
she has to do that.

390
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,639
She left me two messages.

391
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,731
For the brain scan.

392
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,639
Another one.

393
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,119
No.

394
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,240
Yes.

395
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,599
It's important.

396
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,559
Dad's worried and me too.

397
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,039
You're a psychiatrist,
you should be reasonable.

398
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,239
We'll call her later.

399
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,519
Just one appointment,
I'll come with you.

400
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,640
Ok?

401
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,080
Ok.

402
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,240
Go see Kiki.

403
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,959
These are her pills

404
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,399
like a cocktail mix.

405
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,639
Your pills and Mum's?

406
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,759
Yes. My pills are

407
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,279
not many.

408
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,879
Most are hers.

409
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,959
Kiki was playing with them.

410
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:48,879
Put them away.

411
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Look at this.

412
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,079
That's really strong.
Did Mum write the prescription?

413
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,919
No, the psychiatrist did

414
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,439
She saw one?

415
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,520
Really?

416
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,599
He gave her this?

417
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:05,959
Wait...

418
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,600
What?

419
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:08,959
What is it?

420
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,599
What is it, Mum?

421
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,280
What's up?

422
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,760
What?

423
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,639
Take me home...

424
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,159
Take me home...

425
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,119
You are home.

426
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:24,799
No,

427
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,679
I want to go home.

428
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,080
What?

429
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,879
Look at me, what's wrong?

430
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,719
I want to go home.

431
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,919
We are home.

432
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,319
Yes.

433
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,559
No

434
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,440
Look at me.

435
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,119
There's that man

436
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,039
following me everywhere.

437
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,039
Why is he here?

438
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,159
Who, Dad?

439
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,959
That's Dad.

440
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,599
Dad... go see Kiki.

441
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,680
Come with me?

442
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,559
Will you?

443
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,079
Give me your hand.

444
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,439
Don't let go.

445
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,239
Come, don't let go.

446
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,880
What's that?

447
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,920
You ok?

448
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,519
What are you looking at?

449
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,240
What?

450
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,199
I'm scared.

451
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,680
Scared?

452
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,680
Yes?

453
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,279
I don't know.

454
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,840
We're...

455
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,559
We're here.

456
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,520
We're here.

457
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,359
This is the dining room.

458
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,759
I don't

459
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,040
Look at me.

460
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,759
Who am I?

461
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,319
I don't know.

462
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,519
I don't know.

463
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,960
I'm Stéphane.

464
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,560
Who am I?

465
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,880
Stéphane.

466
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,479
Mum!

467
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,559
It's me.

468
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,479
You can't kiss my lips!

469
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,200
Ok Dad?

470
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,719
I've got the DVD you wanted.

471
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Shall we watch?

472
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,040
Mum?

473
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,359
Sit here.

474
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,719
<i>We observe the world</i>

475
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,039
<i>to understand it</i>

476
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,279
<i>and evolve in it.</i>

477
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,599
<i>Intelligence helped us make tools</i>

478
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,479
<i>to understand the infinitely small</i>

479
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,199
<i>and the infinitely large.</i>

480
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,920
Coming, Kiki!

481
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,279
<i>For over a century,</i>

482
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,199
<i>psychologists, biologists,</i>

483
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,639
<i>geneticists and neuroscientists</i>

484
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,279
<i>have dissected, analysed</i>

485
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,919
<i>and measured our world.</i>

486
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,519
<i>We have invented computers</i>

487
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,239
<i>and walked on the moon</i>

488
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,159
<i>but contrary to what we think,</i>

489
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,399
<i>our intelligence is not growing.</i>

490
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,799
<i>Today science explores</i>

491
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,199
<i>the many facets of our intelligence</i>

492
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,319
<i>but do scientists really know</i>

493
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,799
No, let's not add problems.

494
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:06,159
But you know,
there's a big word in life...

495
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,719
"Love".

496
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,519
I loved you

497
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,919
I left you four messages,

498
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,040
with no answer.

499
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,159
You stay here?

500
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,159
I'll go see Dad
and be right back.

501
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,639
True

502
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,279
True

503
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,439
Yes, there was...

504
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,359
someone.

505
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,679
My wife is in bed, asleep.

506
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,119
My son

507
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,359
He's here.

508
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,999
Ok, I hope so.

509
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,199
Thank you, my love.

510
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,039
Yes, right, I...

511
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,839
I'll be strong.

512
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,639
Remember her?

513
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,119
Who's that?

514
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,080
Paulette?

515
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,360
Nearly

516
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,080
Pauline.

517
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,280
Whose mum is she?

518
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,200
I don't know.

519
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,999
Who's Pauline?

520
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,400
Whose mum is she

521
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,159
She's

522
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,399
What's your name?

523
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,520
Kiki.

524
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,040
Kiki.

525
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,399
That's when...

526
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,159
we were in Berlin.

527
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,359
You took the photos.

528
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,559
You take good photos.

529
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,759
Don't you?

530
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,919
You know that?

531
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,679
Does Dad cook?

532
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,359
How do you manage?

533
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:49,960
You cook?

534
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,159
Can you say a sentence?

535
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,760
Just one.

536
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,640
Now and then.

537
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,719
Who shops, is it Dad?

538
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,080
You'll hurt yourself.

539
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,119
Does it hurt?

540
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,320
Your hand.

541
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,480
You hurt your hand!

542
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,720
I saw...

543
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,239
I saw that!

544
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,479
A bit of quiet!

545
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,200
Gently.

546
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,240
Play gently.

547
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,760
You're crying.

548
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,440
Why?

549
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,399
What happened?

550
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,240
She's not well.

551
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,519
Did Kiki...

552
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,519
scare you?

553
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,359
Did Kiki scare you?

554
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,999
Dad, don't say that

555
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,602
Kiki didn't make her cry.

556
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,199
No, but he did a bit.

557
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,479
He does things like that!

558
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,600
He's playing.

559
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,080
He's playing, but in a way...

560
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,119
Yes, but... Don't get angry!

561
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:39,840
Dad, calm down!

562
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,879
He's playing, but in a way...

563
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,519
We're at table, not in the street.

564
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,800
Play quietly.

565
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,559
Grandpa and Grandma are tired.

566
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,639
Play quietly.

567
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,720
My love...

568
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:32,960
My love...

569
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,080
Don't cry.

570
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,959
I can't stand it.

571
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:58,960
No.

572
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:06,760
Feeling ok?

573
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,040
You're ok?

574
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,199
Yes, smile...

575
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,639
Yes, smile...

576
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,200
A little smile...

577
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,199
Good, that's lovely.

578
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,159
It's nice... It's beautiful.

579
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,359
You are so sweet...

580
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:49,920
So beautiful...

581
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:03,599
What can I do?

582
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:06,880
Tell me.

583
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,200
Say it.

584
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,999
What can I do?

585
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,440
Say it.

586
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:21,880
Be...

587
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,719
I'll do it. Tell me.

588
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:37,959
Be here.

589
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:39,680
Be here?

590
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,199
He is.

591
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,639
Dad's here.

592
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,239
All three of us are.

593
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,839
All the family.

594
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,040
With noisy Kiki.

595
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,399
It's lovely.

596
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:55,519
It's the most beautiful thing.

597
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,720
Your son.

598
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,200
Our son.

599
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:04,680
So handsome!

600
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,999
She's very ill.

601
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,160
You've seen

602
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,680
you know.

603
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,919
I didn't know.

604
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,182
When I was here three weeks ago

605
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,639
True.

606
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,559
Every day, she's worse.

607
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,279
It's a disease with no cure.

608
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,117
No drugs, no pills.

609
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,559
There are solutions.

610
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,079
Solutions?

611
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,719
They're like water.

612
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,239
Yes, they are.

613
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,519
Sit up.

614
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:45,919
The psychiatrist said so.

615
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,011
They're like water.

616
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,959
Have you seen one?

617
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,679
Yes, often.

618
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,199
She's declining.

619
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:00,239
Like this, downhill...

620
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,079
Constantly...

621
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,839
You didn't tell me it was getting worse.

622
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,879
Why?

623
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:16,319
Why worry you?

624
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,239
You have your life... your son,

625
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,039
you have lots going on, your work.

626
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,799
But Dad...

627
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,319
You can't handle this alone.

628
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:32,839
Mum is writing her own prescriptions.

629
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:37,559
But the pharmacist knows her.

630
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,519
When she goes in,

631
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:44,519
he doesn't give her what she wants.

632
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:49,239
Drugs that don't work.

633
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:55,119
Or are bad for the brain.

634
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,119
But you're

635
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:02,719
I follow her, but it's not easy.

636
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,799
But I asked, I

637
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,559
You must be strong.

638
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:18,799
I can't!

639
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:19,960
You must be strong.

640
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:23,359
Like I am, sometimes,

641
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,480
sometimes not.

642
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,839
I called 10 days ago to see
if you spoke to Nathalie.

643
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,439
You said you did, but you didn't.

644
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,079
No, I didn't

645
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,200
I know.

646
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,079
You say you're managing but you're not.

647
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,200
No.

648
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,080
Pauline...

649
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,119
How is she?

650
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,839
I told you she was in hospital.

651
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:47,880
Again.

652
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:50,840
Do you see her?

653
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,679
Do you see her?

654
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,959
When we do things for Kiki

655
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,439
or with the social worker.

656
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:06,999
Her last fit two months ago was really

657
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,359
violent.

658
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,719
It was tough on Kiki.

659
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,039
It's my fault.

660
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:18,919
No, it's not.

661
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,679
Illness is not our fault.

662
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,439
Mum's illness isn't my fault.

663
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:27,799
But the drugs, Dad

664
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,439
Your wife's illness isn't your fault.

665
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,279
These things happen.

666
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,519
It's fate.

667
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,240
No.

668
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,559
Yes, it's fate

669
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,799
moving through the city.

670
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,439
It moves

671
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,600
then strikes.

672
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,359
It acts

673
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,719
and illness comes.

674
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,799
And you, how's the money?

675
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,799
There is none. It's gone.

676
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:14,519
Really?

677
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:15,799
I never have any.

678
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,160
You know that.

679
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:21,919
You didn't find a good job?

680
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,279
Sure

681
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:28,039
I do a documentary

682
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,439
or some editing stuff like that.

683
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,279
It's fine.

684
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,519
I get my benefits,

685
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:42,719
I do enough hours.

686
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:44,479
But I spend the money.

687
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,039
It's the same for both of us.

688
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:51,920
We're broke.

689
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:53,280
Yes.

690
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,120
Cheers!

691
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,160
To the future!

692
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,239
Don't push it with Claire

693
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,839
It's extra hassle.

694
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:18,119
I call, but she

695
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:19,919
never answers.

696
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:21,999
It's tricky for her.

697
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,799
Of course.

698
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,839
It's been 20 years

699
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,360
us two.

700
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,919
In love.
We travelled everywhere.

701
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,239
It...

702
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,959
meant a lot to me.

703
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,519
But now

704
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,759
it's almost over.

705
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:53,119
Not yet, but almost.

706
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,359
That's our life,

707
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,519
all messed up.

708
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,879
Still smoking?

709
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:15,560
Yes.

710
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,079
Maybe I'll kill myself.

711
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:28,559
Remember the issues I've had?

712
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,679
Do you take your pills?

713
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,359
Totally.

714
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,999
Totally, every day.

715
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,559
Four pills, always.

716
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,159
Without them...

717
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,039
It's too dangerous.

718
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,240
I'd die.

719
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:49,920
And you?

720
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:55,559
You take the drugs
the doctor prescribed you?

721
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,319
I have substitutes,

722
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:02,879
but I don't like them.

723
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,039
They just

724
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,839
there's no pain, but

725
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,240
it's crap.

726
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,399
Son,

727
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,759
our house is full of drugs.

728
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,759
And druggies.

729
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,319
Indeed.

730
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,279
And Mum?

731
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,479
She's the most

732
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:36,839
The least of us.

733
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,159
Yes.

734
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:47,439
Be careful with what she takes.

735
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:49,279
Don't get mixed up.

736
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,559
She's taking super strong drugs.

737
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,320
I know.

738
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,279
I know the pills

739
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,119
are very strong.

740
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,079
I'm very careful.

741
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:14,640
It's a life

742
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,199
It's a life among drugs.

743
01:08:22,279 --> 01:08:23,439
We're really

744
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:26,760
almost...

745
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,519
slaves to drugs.

746
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:41,799
You know...

747
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,599
he doesn't sleep at night.

748
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,199
He's crazy.

749
01:08:54,279 --> 01:08:55,559
Why?

750
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,239
He leaves papers everywhere!

751
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:06,318
A total mess.

752
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,959
I try to tidy

753
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,599
but I can't.

754
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:22,318
You don't have to tidy.

755
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:24,839
I go crazy.

756
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:33,999
So, what I'm going to do...

757
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:38,398
is prescribe him Neuroplax.

758
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:39,159
No.

759
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,600
Yes!

760
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,199
Don't do that.

761
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,039
I can do it.

762
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:55,519
It's good when you're here.

763
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,719
You'll see with Nathalie

764
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,759
for prescriptions.

765
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,759
You can't do them any more.

766
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:13,920
Yes, I can.

767
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,839
They know me at the pharmacy.

768
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,679
I have my doctor's card.

769
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,999
Can I take this for Kiki?

770
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,239
Take what you want.

771
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,959
If he's hungry later.
And a yoghurt.

772
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:32,559
Take more.

773
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,999
Do you have to go?

774
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,440
Yes.

775
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,599
She's fetching him tomorrow.

776
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,959
Why not sleep here?

777
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,879
Not tonight.

778
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:16,960
I'll get Kiki.

779
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:23,879
Kiki...

780
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,280
Yes, Daddy?

781
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,119
Put your cars away.

782
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:30,240
We're leaving.

783
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:31,280
Now?

784
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,279
Coming?

785
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,480
Ok?

786
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,359
Kiki and I are going.

787
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:51,839
You're off?

788
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,200
Yes.

789
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,159
Can you lend me 200?

790
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,759
My card was eaten.

791
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:02,080
Stupid me.

792
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,919
Thanks.

793
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:21,959
Be careful with the drugs
Mum gives you

794
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,599
Drugs? You think she'll

795
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:29,839
poison me?

796
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:31,239
No!

797
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:32,119
No?

798
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:33,959
She doesn't want to poison you.

799
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:35,840
She...

800
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,119
she thinks she's still a doctor
and can prescribe.

801
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,120
She's mixed up.

802
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:46,279
So, keep your pills separate.

803
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,119
Be careful.

804
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:49,800
Thanks.

805
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:51,999
Love you.

806
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,120
Me too.

807
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:34,760
I smell gas.

808
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:36,880
Gas!

809
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:38,640
What have you done?

810
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:40,440
Gas!

811
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,039
What have you done?

812
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,240
You're mad!

813
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:15,599
It's ok

814
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:17,720
Mad!

815
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:44,999
I've tidied your desk.

816
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:46,879
What?

817
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,239
Tidied your desk...

818
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,159
My papers!

819
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,079
On the desk!

820
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:57,599
You put them in the toilet!

821
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,199
That's

822
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:07,679
It's a disaster!

823
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:12,359
A total disaster!

824
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:14,440
You want to kill me.

825
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:16,680
Always!

826
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:23,799
This house has become...

827
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,519
A real nightmare!

828
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:44,760
You destroyed

829
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,759
my papers, my book.

830
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:57,360
All my papers.

831
01:23:58,560 --> 01:23:59,999
All I wrote

832
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,519
I can't say you are mad.

833
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:10,119
You're worse!

834
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:22,639
Dad, I don't know how to help.

835
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,399
You are getting into a stage...

836
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,559
where Mum is losing it.

837
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:30,639
You had heart problems.

838
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,319
It was bad.

839
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,439
And it's getting worse for both of you.

840
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:42,799
Since I'm worried for Mum,

841
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,919
she told me about a home

842
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,839
where you can have your things.

843
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,759
They're flats,

844
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:56,199
with nurses and carers,

845
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:59,119
psychologists, psychiatrists

846
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:03,399
There's a room for two

847
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:09,439
available in...

848
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,719
a month or two.

849
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,639
It's rare to find a room for two.

850
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,959
But I

851
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:20,520
don't want that.

852
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:24,119
I don't want to leave this house...

853
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:27,279
where we've lived all our life.

854
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,559
It holds

855
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,919
our past, our things

856
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,919
reminders of our lives.

857
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:38,839
Mine, hers

858
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:44,239
Our work, our books.

859
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:48,319
All this is part of our

860
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:51,400
life.

861
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,519
We can't leave this house.

862
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:56,039
You can take things.

863
01:26:56,480 --> 01:27:00,879
Hundreds of books?

864
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:04,119
Journals, magazines

865
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:06,399
Impossible!

866
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:10,319
We'd throw most away.

867
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:14,159
I don't throw away my past.

868
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:17,959
I work

869
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:19,599
You can work there.

870
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:22,439
No, I couldn't.

871
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,519
You're deluded.

872
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:27,599
Impossible.

873
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:31,319
I won't go with

874
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:35,839
my wife to a flat that's a hospital...

875
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:43,159
for people wrong in the head.

876
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:46,559
Mum is wrong in the head.

877
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:52,319
She's bad due to an incurable disease

878
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:55,159
which is well known.

879
01:27:55,520 --> 01:28:02,159
Young psychiatrists specialise in it.

880
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,879
Have you called them?

881
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:06,159
Yes, I have.

882
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:07,560
Yes, I have a list.

883
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,839
Nathalie says not.

884
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:13,359
But I have a list

885
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,239
of young psychiatrists

886
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:18,359
specialised in this disease.

887
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:21,359
We've spoken.

888
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:25,839
There's no cure.

889
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,599
You can't manage alone.

890
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:32,079
Don't say you call them, you don't.

891
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:33,719
I called!

892
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:35,439
To get a list!

893
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,839
A long list in your office.

894
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:40,599
You called, but Mum hasn't seen anyone.

895
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,359
Have you seen a psychiatrist?

896
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:46,039
Mum, have you seen a psychiatrist?

897
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:48,719
I talked to one.

898
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:51,719
I don't care if you called.

899
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:53,080
Stop

900
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:55,879
I met one

901
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:57,959
at the lab.

902
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:00,999
I've talked about it.

903
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,279
Everyone knows this disease.

904
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:07,039
It's well known.

905
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,159
To everyone.

906
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:15,320
Dad

907
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,479
It's be better if I was...

908
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,120
dead.

909
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,639
Don't say that.

910
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,319
Don't.

911
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,279
It's not true.

912
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:33,359
You're with us.

913
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:36,239
Alive, talking

914
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:37,679
moving forwards.

915
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,919
You have a past to share.

916
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:41,880
No.

917
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,199
Sorry

918
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,919
I'm really sorry.

919
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,759
Don't be, Mum.

920
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:52,479
We're looking for solutions,

921
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:53,600
good ones.

922
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:58,422
Dad, I can't help you properly.

923
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,039
I can't.

924
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:05,159
If Mum falls over

925
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:08,159
You never come over

926
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,399
almost never.

927
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,559
Yes, I do, whenever I can.

928
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:16,399
I don't want to be mean

929
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:20,279
but if anyone has to go

930
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:25,079
to a clinic, a hospital...

931
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,679
or a home,

932
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:28,879
it's you!

933
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:34,119
You have problems to solve.

934
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,799
But Dad, I tried!

935
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:38,559
Stop!

936
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:40,799
It's ok.

937
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,719
It's the first time we've talked,

938
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
it's important.

939
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,519
It's the first time we

940
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,799
open our souls.

941
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:54,039
The first time.

942
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:54,999
I'm sorry

943
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:56,160
Don't be.

944
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:58,679
Dad, when I

945
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:00,919
I'm not against you

946
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:02,479
That's not the point!

947
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:04,639
I'm not.

948
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:09,879
You don't want to be mean,

949
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:17,679
but it's silly to say I
should be in a clinic.

950
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:19,559
That's not the point.

951
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:21,439
It's not!

952
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,479
I'm trying

953
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:27,119
I help at the association,

954
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:28,599
I have a social worker.

955
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:33,359
I don't come much because I'm trying

956
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:37,119
to get organised.

957
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:44,599
When I went

958
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:46,360
Mum...

959
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:47,720
Sorry.

960
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:51,800
For what?

961
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:54,360
For what?

962
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:57,119
You're not guilty.

963
01:31:58,560 --> 01:31:59,560
Of anything.

964
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,159
When you

965
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:08,479
put me in the mental hospital.

966
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:13,879
You were doing your best.

967
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:17,559
For you!

968
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:20,039
You didn't say it was a cage or a prison.

969
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:22,559
You meant well.

970
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:24,800
For a while

971
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:26,719
just a time.

972
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:27,959
Listen to me.

973
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:29,279
That's irrelevant.

974
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,079
It was a mental hospital.

975
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:32,959
You meant well and it was good.

976
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,519
From then on

977
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:36,959
even though I didn't

978
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,439
Things happened.

979
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:44,959
I had bearings, support.

980
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:52,159
I could do things healthily.

981
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:54,999
You meant well.

982
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:01,679
I can't take care of you properly.

983
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:04,519
If Mum falls, you can't pick her up.

984
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:06,296
If she's lost, you don't know where to go.

985
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,159
If you fall

986
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:09,879
You had a stroke 3 years ago.

987
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,039
If you fall, what does Mum do?

988
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:16,079
Sometimes she doesn't know who she is,
or you, or even the neighbour!

989
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:19,599
True?

990
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,879
I'm dealing with it.

991
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,399
I've asked my friends,

992
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:30,039
journalists, writers, important people,

993
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,159
for a man,

994
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,959
not a woman, too weak

995
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:37,439
a strong man who can

996
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:41,719
help pick her up if need be,

997
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:45,039
go out with her in the street.

998
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:46,679
You've met them?

999
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,359
No, I have names on a list.

1000
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:51,319
Just names and lists!

1001
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:55,279
A man in particular,

1002
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:58,119
who lived with a family,

1003
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:00,120
everyone knows him,

1004
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:03,039
they say he's a good man.

1005
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:04,679
So what?

1006
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:11,079
And I also found a new psychiatrist.

1007
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,359
I have a list!

1008
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:14,520
Dad, I'm...

1009
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:16,799
I'm not accusing you.

1010
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:22,839
I'm not.

1011
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,079
I know you're trying

1012
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,439
You make lists, you call,

1013
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:29,199
but no-one is here to help you.

1014
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:34,799
You told me I often lied to you.

1015
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:36,319
Right?

1016
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:43,719
I'd lie so you wouldn't worry.

1017
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,239
Now you're lying, Dad.

1018
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:49,839
Don't say you're not.

1019
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:52,879
I know you make lists.

1020
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:58,639
But I can't help you.

1021
01:34:58,760 --> 01:34:59,999
I can't even help myself!

1022
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:05,519
Kiki we have a custody worker

1023
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:07,479
who says you can or can't do this.

1024
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:09,239
I can't help you.

1025
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:12,719
The little I do, you don't follow up.

1026
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:16,839
You say you make lists,
I trust you, I know you do!

1027
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:22,559
I want someone more capable
than me or you two to help.

1028
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:28,399
Let's make her feel...

1029
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:30,479
good.

1030
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:32,919
Good...

1031
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:42,159
Your son and your husband love you.

1032
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:43,880
For sure.

1033
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,599
They'll help you.

1034
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:48,479
Dad,

1035
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:50,359
I don't want

1036
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:53,999
to lecture, ok?

1037
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:56,519
Everyone

1038
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:58,919
I just...

1039
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:02,399
Mum is lucid today,

1040
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,119
she's stable

1041
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:11,719
I want us to talk.

1042
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:12,880
You who like lists,

1043
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:14,399
let's list good ideas.

1044
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:16,359
Just good ones.

1045
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:19,599
Don't reject them all.

1046
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:21,919
Maybe a home is not a good idea.

1047
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:27,239
Maybe there are ideas there,

1048
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:29,759
with carers, we could ask.

1049
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:32,719
If not that home, another one?

1050
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:36,719
I want us to agree on a process.

1051
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:39,399
I want you to

1052
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:42,079
be rid of me.

1053
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:46,239
What do you mean?

1054
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,239
Of course, it's tiring and tense,

1055
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:53,759
but we're talking!

1056
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:55,999
If we don't, it's crap.

1057
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:59,439
You'd have talked to your patients,
wouldn't you?

1058
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:03,639
You'd have talked to your patients.

1059
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:05,759
You'd say: "something's wrong."

1060
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:08,679
"We can do this, change that"

1061
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:10,040
Yes or no?

1062
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:14,200
Yes.

1063
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:17,999
Us too, awkwardly perhaps,

1064
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:20,119
because Dad is Italian and shouts.

1065
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:23,759
And I'm stubborn.

1066
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:27,720
Dad?

1067
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:31,599
We're clumsy, that's all.

1068
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,159
Talking is important.

1069
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:39,640
It would be

1070
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,599
We're a small family

1071
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:43,600
really small...

1072
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:44,599
Not big!

1073
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:45,720
Three people.

1074
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:47,600
And Kiki.

1075
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:50,760
No-one else.

1076
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,319
I'm a bit tired

1077
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:56,679
You're tired?

1078
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:57,960
A bit.

1079
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,759
Do you want a coffee, a tea?

1080
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:01,919
Yes.

1081
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:03,239
Dad, a coffee?

1082
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,719
No, thanks. Water.

1083
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:11,279
Let's...

1084
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:15,559
pretend it's normal.

1085
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:27,479
Do you have a...

1086
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:28,640
cigarette?

1087
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:12,239
Got any kits?

1088
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:14,919
We need 2 or 3 shoot kits.

1089
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:16,040
2 or 3?

1090
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:17,439
Go for 3.

1091
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:19,600
Thanks.

1092
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:21,639
And a crack pipe.

1093
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:26,519
Need a stick?

1094
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:28,879
Sure, why not.

1095
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:31,919
Paper towels, water?

1096
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:33,360
No.

1097
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:35,920
We're cool.

1098
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:38,039
Ok, take care.

1099
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:43,719
Lots of needles today!

1100
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:50,679
Few people now.

1101
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:56,879
How's your Mum?

1102
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:58,919
So-so...

1103
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:03,119
Old age sucks

1104
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:04,519
No kidding.

1105
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:08,399
Ageing or smack, which to choose?

1106
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:11,239
We don't choose.

1107
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:13,679
She takes more drugs...

1108
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:16,839
than us or them.

1109
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:22,759
You holding out?

1110
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:24,119
Not great.

1111
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:33,680
Hang on, dudes...

1112
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:35,720
Hello.

1113
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:36,679
We're closing.

1114
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:38,439
Give me some kit.

1115
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:40,959
Please.

1116
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:42,519
One each.

1117
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:43,840
We're closing

1118
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:44,879
Sticks?

1119
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:45,879
For my friend!

1120
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:47,199
You know the score.

1121
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:49,759
He's coming!

1122
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:53,119
So when?

1123
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:54,680
He'll come alone.

1124
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:56,319
We're here tomorrow.

1125
01:40:57,240 --> 01:40:57,719
Ok.

1126
01:40:58,200 --> 01:40:59,200
Tell him to come.

1127
01:40:59,240 --> 01:40:59,599
Ok.

1128
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:00,800
We're here every day.

1129
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:02,480
Bye.

1130
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:03,680
Take care, guys.

1131
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,519
Closing time.

1132
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:14,039
The Memory of Film.
That's our next issue.

1133
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:16,839
And we could use it
to get some money.

1134
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,759
We are the memory of film!

1135
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:21,599
And you, you're writing a book!

1136
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,799
I'm writing a book.

1137
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:27,039
A book on...

1138
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:29,319
on film and dreams.

1139
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:31,079
Great!

1140
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:33,199
Dreams, memory

1141
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:35,120
What fires dreams?

1142
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:36,200
It's not the same.

1143
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:38,199
No, it's not. It's different.

1144
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:41,399
It's totally linked.

1145
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:42,679
It's completely different.

1146
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:44,879
Coffee?

1147
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:47,200
Me.

1148
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:51,040
Excuse me.

1149
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:53,040
How's your wife?

1150
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:54,880
Not good.

1151
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:56,120
At all.

1152
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:16,200
What is it?

1153
01:42:16,376 --> 01:42:17,815
What is it?

1154
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:19,479
You're avoiding me.

1155
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:21,399
That's what.

1156
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:23,319
We can't discuss it here.

1157
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:34,199
Is something up?

1158
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:34,839
No.

1159
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:36,120
Really?

1160
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:39,319
We need a break.

1161
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:42,119
I still love you.

1162
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:44,039
Always.

1163
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:46,959
I'm still in love with you

1164
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:48,680
Truly

1165
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:50,159
Deeply.

1166
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:51,919
I know, me too.

1167
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:54,399
It breaks my heart.

1168
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:56,399
I miss you.

1169
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:59,319
Your kindness, your love.

1170
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:04,359
Your tenderness.

1171
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:14,679
We must go back.

1172
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:53,880
Steph!

1173
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,199
Can I come to yours?

1174
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:57,399
No.

1175
01:43:57,680 --> 01:43:58,719
Can I smoke at yours?

1176
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:00,599
Please

1177
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:03,199
Let me in, please.

1178
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:05,639
If you want something

1179
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:07,719
Smack? I can get you smack.

1180
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,719
I know a guy, he's got mean shit!

1181
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:15,279
The best to shoot up.

1182
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:18,199
It's clean.

1183
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:21,079
Not far away!

1184
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:22,999
I'll score it for you.

1185
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:24,319
No money.

1186
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:27,839
Well whenever you want.

1187
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:28,960
I'm here.

1188
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:31,439
Let me smoke inside.

1189
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:33,919
If you change your mind

1190
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:36,079
I'm here.

1191
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:37,479
Go on!

1192
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:39,279
Ok, come in.

1193
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:31,719
Oh God.

1194
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,000
What are you doing?

1195
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:07,360
I'm in pain.

1196
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:10,639
My heart

1197
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,080
I'll just

1198
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:22,599
Good.

1199
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,720
That's better.

1200
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:25,320
Yes.

1201
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:36,039
What can I?

1202
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:37,959
Ambulance...

1203
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:40,399
Call an ambulance.

1204
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:08,359
I'm calling.

1205
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:10,279
Stéphane.

1206
01:51:11,960 --> 01:51:13,239
Zero.

1207
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:14,999
Six.

1208
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:17,560
Six.

1209
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:19,039
Five.

1210
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:20,920
Seven.

1211
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:23,199
Four.

1212
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:25,120
Seven.

1213
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:26,959
Six.

1214
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:29,920
Four.

1215
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:31,239
Five.

1216
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:32,360
It's ok.

1217
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:40,679
Stéphane

1218
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:43,639
it's Mum.

1219
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:48,039
Dad had a fall...

1220
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:49,959
in his office.

1221
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:53,319
Call...

1222
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:56,319
for an ambulance.

1223
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,639
Call for an ambulance.

1224
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:01,799
Fast. And come over.

1225
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:06,799
I don't know.

1226
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Come over.

1227
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:15,439
He'll deal with it.

1228
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:17,960
Good.

1229
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:20,959
Are you cold?

1230
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:24,880
Ok?

1231
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:27,119
Breathe

1232
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:52,919
I'm nearby if you need me.

1233
01:55:54,040 --> 01:55:55,079
Thanks.

1234
01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:27,719
I'll leave you with your son.

1235
01:56:55,960 --> 01:56:57,719
I'm here.

1236
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:30,159
Is he alright?

1237
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:40,799
Are you?

1238
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:32,240
Darling?

1239
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:35,680
Darling?

1240
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:27,039
What's the matter?

1241
02:04:30,640 --> 02:04:31,999
Your husband's gone.

1242
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:35,399
He won't be back.

1243
02:04:36,520 --> 02:04:37,559
Go get some sleep.

1244
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:41,999
And call your son tomorrow, ok?

1245
02:08:40,280 --> 02:08:41,280
Of course.

1246
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:42,360
Where is this place?

1247
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:44,960
I know it.

1248
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:48,040
Ok.

1249
02:08:48,080 --> 02:08:48,919
I'll tell her.

1250
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:50,040
Right away.

1251
02:08:51,480 --> 02:08:52,480
Have a nice day.

1252
02:09:00,640 --> 02:09:01,640
Madam?

1253
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:02,960
Ok?

1254
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:06,759
I just spoke to your son.

1255
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:09,079
Stéphane.

1256
02:09:09,800 --> 02:09:11,079
He's very pleased.

1257
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:12,839
He's found you a home.

1258
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:15,200
Great!

1259
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:17,999
Not far.

1260
02:09:20,280 --> 02:09:21,519
At the Porte de Pantin.

1261
02:09:22,600 --> 02:09:25,399
That's good! It's a good place.

1262
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:31,079
We'll get you ready to go.

1263
02:09:32,720 --> 02:09:34,159
Fill your wash bag.

1264
02:09:35,080 --> 02:09:36,559
Choose your clothes.

1265
02:09:39,400 --> 02:09:40,919
He's so glad.

1266
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:44,639
You...

1267
02:09:45,560 --> 02:09:47,239
You are

1268
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:48,800
who?

1269
02:09:50,160 --> 02:09:52,599
I've been coming for a few days

1270
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,879
to help you, give you food, your
pills.

1271
02:09:56,480 --> 02:09:57,719
We talk.

1272
02:09:58,880 --> 02:09:59,880
Together.

1273
02:10:00,120 --> 02:10:02,519
You talk of your childhood, your grandma.

1274
02:10:05,400 --> 02:10:08,479
We know each other, I talk about my life.

1275
02:10:10,440 --> 02:10:11,559
And now

1276
02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:15,999
your son is so glad
because I'm not always here.

1277
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:17,839
It's best for you.

1278
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:21,399
You'll be safe, with people who listen,

1279
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:22,959
who talk,

1280
02:10:24,840 --> 02:10:26,719
who care for you every day.

1281
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:28,040
It'll be great.

1282
02:11:21,640 --> 02:11:23,759
Our Father, Who art in Heaven...

1283
02:12:46,680 --> 02:12:48,679
Lead us not into temptation,

1284
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:50,519
but deliver us from evil.

1285
02:13:50,040 --> 02:13:51,399
Our Father, Who art in Heaven,

1286
02:13:52,600 --> 02:13:54,159
hallowed be Thy name.

1287
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:56,479
Thy kingdom come,

1288
02:13:57,200 --> 02:13:58,839
Thy will be done

1289
02:13:58,960 --> 02:14:00,319
on earth as it is in Heaven.

1290
02:14:02,640 --> 02:14:04,559
Give us this day our daily bread

1291
02:14:06,280 --> 02:14:09,240
and forgive us our trespasses, as we
forgive those who trespass against us.

1292
02:14:11,800 --> 02:14:13,759
Lead us not into temptation,

1293
02:14:14,680 --> 02:14:16,199
but deliver us from evil.

1294
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:18,039
Amen.

1295
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,199
The papers will be ready this afternoon.

1296
02:15:32,440 --> 02:15:34,359
Do you have all the elements?

1297
02:15:36,680 --> 02:15:37,199
I'll take them.

1298
02:15:37,480 --> 02:15:38,480
Thank you.

1299
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:46,840
Thank you.

1300
02:15:48,280 --> 02:15:51,319
For women, most choose white flowers.

1301
02:15:57,760 --> 02:16:00,719
You have a choice of urns,
take your time looking through.

1302
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:04,439
We are here for you, of course.

1303
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:09,880
Mum,

1304
02:16:11,240 --> 02:16:12,599
my beloved mum.

1305
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:17,399
The last months with you and Dad
were intense.

1306
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:20,799
And it was weird for me,

1307
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:24,239
who was always your
prime anxiety,

1308
02:16:24,360 --> 02:16:27,119
to play parent

1309
02:16:29,040 --> 02:16:31,399
and dare to make decisions for you...

1310
02:16:33,080 --> 02:16:34,199
sometimes

1311
02:16:36,680 --> 02:16:38,919
against your freedom of action.

1312
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:44,119
All dreams are short,

1313
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:47,319
dreams within dreams even more so.

1314
02:16:49,400 --> 02:16:51,879
I hope your sleep is finally peaceful.

1315
02:16:53,080 --> 02:16:55,399
We will do as you wished, Mum,

1316
02:16:55,840 --> 02:16:57,839
so no-one disturbs your journey.

1317
02:16:59,960 --> 02:17:02,079
On behalf of Kiki, myself,

1318
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:04,959
your friends and relatives,

1319
02:17:05,520 --> 02:17:07,359
we say thank you, Mum.

1320
02:17:13,240 --> 02:17:14,919
Thank you for sharing, sir.

1321
02:17:18,880 --> 02:17:20,119
Ladies and gentlemen,

1322
02:17:20,360 --> 02:17:22,919
we will now watch a slide show

1323
02:17:23,120 --> 02:17:25,638
to recall happy times
spent with the deceased.

1324
02:19:01,559 --> 02:19:04,359
Grandma and Grandpa have a new home?

1325
02:19:05,440 --> 02:19:06,440
No.

1326
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:09,200
That's not a home.

1327
02:19:12,440 --> 02:19:14,119
Homes are for the living.

1328
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:53,719
THE END

1328
02:21:54,305 --> 02:22:54,351
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
