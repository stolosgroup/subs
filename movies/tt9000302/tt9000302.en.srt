00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:52,408
You got to help me look for a new place.

3
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:54,386
My nosy neighbors are getting worse.

4
00:00:54,427 --> 00:00:56,335
They are saying I come home late
because I'm a hooker.

5
00:00:56,376 --> 00:00:57,626
<i>Does that bother you?</i>

6
00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:59,834
Nope. But I'm not a hooker.

7
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,022
<i>Maybe it's easier being a hooker.</i>

8
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:03,255
You sleep with them then they pay you.

9
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,513
Wouldn't be that easy.
You have to put make-up on every night.

10
00:01:05,554 --> 00:01:07,959
And your client may be rough or too big.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,167
You have to know how to pick them.

12
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,216
<i>And how would you do that?</i>

13
00:01:10,257 --> 00:01:13,083
How would I know if a client
is rough or too big beforehand?

14
00:01:13,124 --> 00:01:15,260
I'd check before
I'd agree to sleep with them.

15
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:17,917
If his dick was limp, how would you know
it would be too big?

16
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:18,966
<i>I would know.</i>

17
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:21,350
You wouldn't
because you're a clueless virgin.

18
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:23,004
Hang on, a car is coming.

19
00:01:26,673 --> 00:01:28,365
You didn't put me on speaker?

20
00:01:28,406 --> 00:01:29,417
If the boss finds out,
you'll be in trouble.

21
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:30,607
Done.

22
00:01:30,884 --> 00:01:32,183
<i>Aren't you using up all your phone data?</i>

23
00:01:32,224 --> 00:01:33,584
I don't care.
Tonight's so quiet, it's creepy.

24
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:34,751
Who's on your shift with you?

25
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:39,322
Mr. Chondro was here. But he left
for the office. I don't know why.

26
00:01:39,723 --> 00:01:42,667
They're closing this toll booth soon.
Not many cars come through this gate.

27
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:45,209
Soon no one will be assigned
to any gate.

28
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,875
It's ridiculous that they are replacing
everybody with machines.

29
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,250
Nobody will have a job.

30
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:52,717
That's why we need to start
our clothing store soon.

31
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:56,417
I won't miss this. I won't have to deal
with so many weird people.

32
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:59,710
Like the guy in the old sedan
that has been stalking me for weeks.

33
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:04,584
I told you. Maybe he's just coming home
from work every day.

34
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,334
Dini, he drove by here twice
or three times in one night.

35
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,331
Isn't that strange?

36
00:02:08,372 --> 00:02:10,751
And he looks at me as if
he's going to eat me alive.

37
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:13,261
What are you, a newbie?
I already told you.

38
00:02:13,302 --> 00:02:15,093
<i>Don't ever look the drivers
in their eyes.</i>

39
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:16,190
<i>Just look at their hands.</i>

40
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:19,831
His hands were gross.
Dirty fingernails and all.

41
00:02:19,872 --> 00:02:20,917
Maybe he's a gravedigger.

42
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,621
You're not helping. It's easy for you,
you're not alone there.

43
00:02:23,662 --> 00:02:24,739
Who is stationed there with you?

44
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:28,341
I got that dude Wahyu.
He's always looking my way.

45
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:31,917
He's been driving me home
these past three days.

46
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,668
Is Wahyu really into second-hand items?

47
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:37,042
<i>Can't you listen to other songs?</i>

48
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,917
It's so last century it sounds creepy.

49
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,884
No. My radio's stuck in AM.
The FM mode is not working.

50
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:45,708
Shit.

51
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:46,834
<i>What's wrong?</i>

52
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,665
That creepy car is here again.

53
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,118
<i>Hello?</i>

54
00:02:56,382 --> 00:02:57,882
<i>Maya?</i>

55
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:03,009
<i>Hello?</i>

56
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:10,417
<i>Maya?</i>

57
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,375
He's still here.

58
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:12,834
<i>Oh, no. What is he doing?</i>

59
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,251
He's staring at me.

60
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:15,470
<i>I'm calling the office.</i>

61
00:03:28,157 --> 00:03:30,574
He's finally gone. Thank you, Sir!

62
00:03:30,615 --> 00:03:32,868
Shit, my heart almost stopped.

63
00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:41,421
Din! It's still here!

64
00:03:41,985 --> 00:03:44,478
He's walking towards my post!
What should I do?

65
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:47,298
Din!

66
00:03:47,671 --> 00:03:50,343
<i>Stay calm. I'm calling the office.</i>

67
00:03:50,384 --> 00:03:53,208
<i>Can someone come
to Bukit Selatan 1 gate now?</i>

68
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:55,665
<i>Someone is harassing an officer.
Now, please!</i>

69
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:56,834
<i>Okay, okay. Just stay calm.</i>

70
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,618
<i>Lock the door! Close the window!</i>

71
00:04:05,884 --> 00:04:07,334
<i>Find something near you!</i>

72
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,710
What do you mean?

73
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:11,584
<i>A metal stick, a rock,
anything you can use as a weapon?</i>

74
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,829
There's nothing here. I'm so dead!

75
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,358
Security guards are coming!

76
00:04:38,031 --> 00:04:39,781
Are you Rahayu?

77
00:04:40,111 --> 00:04:43,025
No, my name's Maya. Can't you read?

78
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,205
- Is that your real name?
- Yes.

79
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:50,079
<i>Hey! Don't mess with her! Go away!</i>

80
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:04,709
Are you from Harjosari Village
in Mandiraja?

81
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,416
What do you want?

82
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:12,472
Is your father's name Ki Donowongso?

83
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:26,525
<i>Maya!</i>

84
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,501
He's going away. He's going.

85
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:35,329
If help doesn't come in a minute,
just get out of there. Leave the booth!

86
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:39,337
<i>Is anyone coming
to the Bukit Selatan 1 booth?</i>

87
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:44,134
Dini, he's coming back with a weapon!

88
00:05:44,392 --> 00:05:45,892
<i>What weapon?</i>

89
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,642
<i>Maya!</i>

90
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,048
<i>Maya!</i>

91
00:05:58,478 --> 00:05:59,673
Maya!

92
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,892
Help!

93
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:41,184
Hey!

94
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,103
Drop your weapon!

95
00:06:45,345 --> 00:06:46,634
We...

96
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:54,282
We just don't want
what your family left behind.

97
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,189
Please take it away.

98
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:55,625
Hey, you wanna check my new collection?

99
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:56,890
Not now.

100
00:08:56,931 --> 00:08:59,167
Pay for the shirt
you bought last week then.

101
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,460
I can't pay you right now.

102
00:09:00,501 --> 00:09:02,970
But you got lots of customers!

103
00:09:03,011 --> 00:09:05,969
Exactly. I'm busy now.

104
00:09:06,482 --> 00:09:09,802
Come on. Just get your purse
and give me my money.

105
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:19,646
You need a new bra?

106
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:35,217
We should've checked first...

107
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:36,464
...whether this market
was good for business.

108
00:09:36,505 --> 00:09:37,251
Relax.

109
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:39,625
We got duped because the rent is cheap.

110
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,370
We'll sell these online.

111
00:09:41,411 --> 00:09:42,870
These crappy fakes?

112
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:46,058
That's why we'll sell them online.

113
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:48,194
Even I wouldn't wear one of these.

114
00:09:48,235 --> 00:09:50,091
I'd rather wear a plastic bag
or a rice sack.

115
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:58,659
Sorry I dragged you into this.
We used up all your money.

116
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,083
It's not like you put a gun to my head.
I wanted to join this business.

117
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,119
I'm going away for a week or so.

118
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,451
Where to?

119
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,052
Where to?

120
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:14,990
Who are they?

121
00:10:15,645 --> 00:10:18,878
After the attack,
I dug into my late aunt's stuff.

122
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,186
I found this photo.

123
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:22,167
I think they're my parents.

124
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:23,583
You "think"?

125
00:10:23,818 --> 00:10:25,959
I never saw photos of them before.

126
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,318
And I was too young
to really remember them.

127
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,146
Rahayu?

128
00:10:33,484 --> 00:10:35,067
So the psycho dude was right?

129
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,464
I do remember my aunt
called me Rahayu when I was young.

130
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:41,166
Then she started calling me Maya.
I don't know why.

131
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,146
So what?

132
00:10:42,187 --> 00:10:43,208
Look at the photo again.
What do you notice?

133
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:48,490
You were really short
for a five-year-old?

134
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:51,464
The house?

135
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:53,570
The big house.

136
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,583
It's the key to solving our problems.
My family's house.

137
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,454
But you don't even know where it is.

138
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:06,302
The psycho mentioned
the name of the village.

139
00:11:06,343 --> 00:11:09,990
Harjosari, Mandiraja. I looked it up.

140
00:11:14,624 --> 00:11:17,521
This could be our chance
to start a new life.

141
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,166
I'm going with you.

142
00:11:20,473 --> 00:11:21,473
No.

143
00:11:22,154 --> 00:11:27,484
You are my best friend.
No way I let you go alone.

144
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:30,987
And if you turn out to be rich,
you can't leave me behind.

145
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:33,221
What about our kiosk?

146
00:11:33,262 --> 00:11:34,888
Nobody comes to buy our stuff anyway.

147
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:37,877
Hey! You can't smoke in there!

148
00:11:37,918 --> 00:11:40,523
You can't be in here, pervert!
This is the ladies room.

149
00:11:40,564 --> 00:11:44,130
Shut up! Get the hell out of here!

150
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,622
What happened?

151
00:12:48,224 --> 00:12:49,699
It's the wound.

152
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,167
How come it still looks fresh?

153
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:53,347
I don't know.
I just need some disinfectant.

154
00:12:53,818 --> 00:12:56,367
Because I know it's not that time
of the month for you.

155
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,450
Stay here.
I'll get you some disinfectant.

156
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:26,793
Dini?

157
00:13:45,497 --> 00:13:46,622
Dini?

158
00:13:56,434 --> 00:13:57,559
Dini?

159
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,249
You haven't gone home?

160
00:14:04,486 --> 00:14:05,944
We will soon.

161
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:11,257
Dini?

162
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:19,544
Dini?

163
00:14:29,814 --> 00:14:30,939
Dini?

164
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,001
People are getting lazier these days.

165
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:42,380
They turn the lights off early
and lock the doors.

166
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,374
The pharmacy is closed.

167
00:14:46,822 --> 00:14:48,200
No medicine for you, then.

168
00:15:04,681 --> 00:15:07,271
HAVE A PLEASANT TRIP

169
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:16,188
What are you reading?

170
00:15:16,229 --> 00:15:17,895
Business planning.

171
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,659
What business?

172
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,513
Any business. So I know my way around
if we're to start another.

173
00:15:22,773 --> 00:15:26,398
Besides, if I don't read,
I'll just go to the toilet all the time.

174
00:15:28,132 --> 00:15:31,340
Turn off your light.
The guy behind us is annoyed.

175
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,583
Goddamn hillbilly.

176
00:15:39,044 --> 00:15:40,976
How long until we get there?

177
00:15:41,017 --> 00:15:43,349
The driver said six hours.

178
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:49,732
See, now I have to pee.

179
00:16:43,286 --> 00:16:44,500
Use this, Love.

180
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,625
You're not going to need it?

181
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,417
It's okay. I'm not cold. Go to sleep.

182
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:52,068
I'll wake you up
when we reach your parents' village.

183
00:17:03,497 --> 00:17:07,166
I wasn't bothered by you or your friend.

184
00:17:07,685 --> 00:17:13,291
I cough sometimes so the spirits
on this bus won't bother the passengers.

185
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,021
Spirits?

186
00:17:15,552 --> 00:17:19,256
There are spirits on this bus.

187
00:17:19,297 --> 00:17:22,888
They don't know where to go.

188
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:29,583
Don't think I'm weird.

189
00:17:30,187 --> 00:17:31,937
I am a university lecturer.

190
00:17:32,348 --> 00:17:34,473
A lecturer? What do you teach?

191
00:17:34,785 --> 00:17:36,654
Russian literature.

192
00:17:41,802 --> 00:17:44,155
I know
it's not much use in this country.

193
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,982
But I love Russian.

194
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,708
Well, I love all languages.

195
00:17:50,872 --> 00:17:53,526
You know Javanese?

196
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:59,650
Why would I study foreign languages
if I don't know my own?

197
00:17:59,888 --> 00:18:06,091
Do you know what this says?

198
00:18:12,564 --> 00:18:15,638
This is very ancient Javanese.

199
00:18:17,427 --> 00:18:22,208
It's a spell so that the carrier
won't be bothered by evil spirits.

200
00:18:22,943 --> 00:18:24,050
So this is like an amulet?

201
00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:28,200
Yes. But this was made
by an evil person.

202
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,646
Where did you get this picture?

203
00:18:31,118 --> 00:18:33,435
From the internet.

204
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,708
What's on your mind?

205
00:18:59,836 --> 00:19:01,622
Nothing.

206
00:19:03,687 --> 00:19:05,353
You're thinking about your parents?

207
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,926
Do you know anything about them at all?

208
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:15,179
No. My aunt raised me.
And she wasn't much of a talker.

209
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,325
If I asked her about my parents,
she wouldn't say much.

210
00:19:20,091 --> 00:19:22,250
Parents are overrated.

211
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,125
I've known my parents all my life.

212
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,366
It didn't do me any good.
Didn't make me happier.

213
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:31,849
But at least you know them.

214
00:19:32,482 --> 00:19:36,810
That's true. Especially if your parents
may have left you with a fortune.

215
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,021
But we really have to be careful.

216
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:43,459
That's why we're going there
just to check things out.

217
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,623
If I do have some sort
of inheritance there,...

218
00:19:44,664 --> 00:19:46,964
...we'll come back with a lawyer.

219
00:19:47,005 --> 00:19:49,036
Lawyer? How fancy.

220
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,128
Thank you for coming with me.

221
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:04,666
Don't mention it.

222
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:08,154
Just pray we won't have to stay
in a place with roaches.

223
00:20:12,232 --> 00:20:14,000
- Holy shit!
- What's wrong?

224
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,314
I swear I saw
those three little girls...

225
00:20:15,355 --> 00:20:16,625
...standing by the side
of the road earlier.

226
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:20,333
It's 1 a.m. All children are sleeping.

227
00:20:20,374 --> 00:20:22,290
I swear to God!

228
00:20:26,031 --> 00:20:27,572
How long did you say
before we get there?

229
00:20:28,442 --> 00:20:29,983
Five hours.

230
00:20:52,771 --> 00:20:55,375
Have you heard of Harjosari?

231
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:59,333
Harjosari? Never heard of it, Miss.

232
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,980
Where did you look the place up? Google?

233
00:21:03,021 --> 00:21:04,417
I tried but couldn't find it.

234
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,792
So I called the Provincial government.
It's there under their territory.

235
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,120
Well nobody ever heard of it.

236
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:11,583
We've only asked one person.

237
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:20,058
Have you heard of Harjosari Village?

238
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:21,167
Yes.

239
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,589
Can you take us there?

240
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,574
No.

241
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,605
Why?

242
00:21:24,646 --> 00:21:25,812
It's too far.

243
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:27,576
How much?

244
00:21:27,617 --> 00:21:29,130
A hundred thousand Rupiah.

245
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:32,622
Okay.

246
00:21:33,435 --> 00:21:35,521
For each of you.

247
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,865
Where are you from?
"Bloodsuckers Village"?

248
00:21:39,273 --> 00:21:40,773
No, I'm from "Handsome
and Rich Village".

249
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,949
Wait until my horse finishes his lunch.

250
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,429
When did you last feed him?
Last month?

251
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,678
Last year.

252
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:54,369
Why do you want to go to Harjosari?

253
00:21:56,301 --> 00:22:00,286
We're university students
and we're doing research.

254
00:22:00,327 --> 00:22:03,849
In Harjosari?
Research on what?

255
00:22:04,396 --> 00:22:05,772
Why are you laughing?

256
00:22:05,813 --> 00:22:08,750
There's nothing in Harjosari.
It's a secluded village.

257
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,708
That's right. We're doing research
on secluded villages.

258
00:22:12,093 --> 00:22:13,310
I see.

259
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:18,792
What do you know about the village?

260
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:20,833
Not much.

261
00:22:20,874 --> 00:22:22,105
I know about the village...

262
00:22:22,146 --> 00:22:24,209
...because I recently took
their village elder home.

263
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,459
The village elder is a puppet master.
He was in my town for a performance.

264
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,709
What's his name?

265
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,458
Ki Saptadi.

266
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,706
He's quite well-known.

267
00:22:32,747 --> 00:22:35,375
Why don't they build
a proper road to the village?

268
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:37,916
I heard they didn't want to.

269
00:22:38,228 --> 00:22:39,229
Why?

270
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,895
I don't know.

271
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,875
Dini, please take off those sunglasses.

272
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,878
But it's so sunny. I'm dizzy.

273
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:50,252
What's your plan?

274
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:52,831
Miss, where do you want me
to drop you off?

275
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,917
Just drop us off at Ki Saptadi's,
the village elder's house.

276
00:22:55,245 --> 00:22:56,959
- Okay.
- Are you sure?

277
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,791
Well, I don't think
we can find a hotel here.

278
00:23:22,654 --> 00:23:24,292
Are we staying the night
in this village?

279
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:25,209
I don't know.

280
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,334
What do you mean you don't know?

281
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,376
Depends on the situation.

282
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:30,667
We don't even know
if my house still exists.

283
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:34,693
I didn't ask you to come with me.
Don't be fussy.

284
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,200
Holy shit, it's huge.

285
00:23:41,661 --> 00:23:43,089
Do you know whose house that is?

286
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,784
I don't know.

287
00:23:44,825 --> 00:23:47,514
I asked Ki Saptadi
when we passed the house,...

288
00:23:47,555 --> 00:23:49,709
...but he didn't say anything.

289
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:54,411
What a waste, right?
A house that big sitting empty.

290
00:24:21,431 --> 00:24:23,014
Do you want me to wait for you?

291
00:24:23,055 --> 00:24:24,747
No, but thanks a lot.

292
00:24:27,482 --> 00:24:31,094
Here's my business card just in case.

293
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:32,630
Thank you.

294
00:24:36,273 --> 00:24:37,700
Thank you.

295
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,857
Let's go, Gorgeous.

296
00:24:48,294 --> 00:24:49,750
We need to come up with a new story.

297
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:51,459
We can't say
that we're university students.

298
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,584
Why not?

299
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:55,358
What should we say
if he starts to ask about our research?

300
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:57,166
I don't know anything about it. Do you?

301
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,500
Just don't say that we're students.

302
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:03,292
What then?

303
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,093
Let me think.

304
00:25:04,134 --> 00:25:05,646
Who are you looking for?

305
00:25:06,884 --> 00:25:09,134
We are university students, Ma'am.
We are hoping to see Ki Saptadi.

306
00:25:11,817 --> 00:25:13,400
What for?

307
00:25:14,732 --> 00:25:17,255
We are writing a book on puppet masters.

308
00:25:17,296 --> 00:25:20,208
We heard Ki Saptadi
is a famous puppet master.

309
00:25:24,638 --> 00:25:27,583
He isn't home.
He'll be back in the evening.

310
00:25:27,624 --> 00:25:30,249
You can come back here tomorrow morning.

311
00:25:30,643 --> 00:25:32,740
Ok, we'll come back tomorrow.

312
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:37,994
Should we call the horse driver
to take us back?

313
00:25:38,035 --> 00:25:42,716
And return here tomorrow?
What a hassle.

314
00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:01,917
There's a pathway.
I think someone must come here often.

315
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:06,771
We'll have to make a huge sign
saying, "Do Not Enter!"

316
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:09,716
It's huge.

317
00:26:09,757 --> 00:26:11,427
Yes, it's really huge.

318
00:26:46,341 --> 00:26:48,380
How long has it been
since the house was abandoned?

319
00:26:48,552 --> 00:26:50,126
Not sure.

320
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:52,958
How old were you
when you moved to the city?

321
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,763
According to my aunt,
when I was five years old.

322
00:26:55,804 --> 00:26:57,720
And you're 25 now?

323
00:26:58,343 --> 00:27:00,482
So this house has been empty
for 20 years.

324
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,396
Who is that?

325
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,036
I don't know. I'm new here.

326
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,570
It seems that this house
was abandoned in a hurry.

327
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,083
What do you mean?

328
00:27:39,254 --> 00:27:41,712
All the furniture is still here.

329
00:28:33,202 --> 00:28:35,435
Yeah. This still works.

330
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:41,471
Where are you going?

331
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:44,943
To check the most important place
in a house.

332
00:29:05,224 --> 00:29:08,193
We'll have to do
lots of pumping tonight.

333
00:30:12,176 --> 00:30:12,998
This is crazy, Maya!

334
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:18,628
This house and the land
may be as big as 900 square meters!

335
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:20,772
Imagine how much money you'd get
if you sell it.

336
00:30:20,813 --> 00:30:22,716
What are you doing?

337
00:30:23,914 --> 00:30:26,302
I found it in the drawer,
still wrapped in a plastic bag.

338
00:30:26,726 --> 00:30:28,892
Does your aunt keep
any of your parents' documents?

339
00:30:29,372 --> 00:30:31,872
Not that I know of.

340
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:36,503
I bet your dad also owned
properties in other places.

341
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,855
We have to reclaim that property too.

342
00:30:38,896 --> 00:30:41,369
My God. You may be stinking rich!

343
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,993
Don't you forget about me, okay?

344
00:30:48,052 --> 00:30:50,380
They made a cute couple.

345
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,271
Are you sad?

346
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:58,957
No, I'm just puzzled.

347
00:30:59,505 --> 00:31:01,041
Puzzled? Why?

348
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,917
I'm not in any of these photos.

349
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:05,404
I'm only in the photo
that I've shown you.

350
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,125
Maybe they didn't get the chance
to take your photo.

351
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:12,279
There are piles of pictures here.
None of me.

352
00:31:13,068 --> 00:31:16,333
Maybe you were an ugly kid?

353
00:31:20,215 --> 00:31:21,935
Don't think about it.

354
00:31:23,185 --> 00:31:26,491
Maybe they just preferred to kiss you
rather than to take photos of you.

355
00:31:26,532 --> 00:31:27,719
Isn't that better?

356
00:31:45,578 --> 00:31:48,138
I think someone just died
and was buried.

357
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:53,917
Are you sure your parents
were buried here?

358
00:31:53,958 --> 00:31:55,541
Where else would they be?

359
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,543
But you said you think
your folks left in a hurry.

360
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,638
You meant they had to leave
the village right?

361
00:32:01,857 --> 00:32:03,695
You might be right.

362
00:32:03,736 --> 00:32:07,000
Let's just finish this row
then we go back to the house.

363
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:08,208
Can we go back to the house now?

364
00:32:08,249 --> 00:32:12,500
Dead people are just dead people.
Why are you afraid of the graveyard?

365
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:15,624
I'm not scared.
I just don't see the point.

366
00:32:16,146 --> 00:32:19,976
Dead people should just be cremated.
So they won't take up space like this.

367
00:32:20,017 --> 00:32:22,271
It's better to turn the land
into housing for the living.

368
00:32:23,677 --> 00:32:25,589
You have to promise me.

369
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:30,457
When I die, please cremate my body.
And spread my ashes in the sea.

370
00:32:31,271 --> 00:32:34,667
I might get reincarnated as a fish.
It's better than being a human.

371
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:36,584
You'll get caught by fishermen
and turned into sushi.

372
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:39,251
I'll be a shark. And eat humans.

373
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:40,583
Sharks don't eat humans.

374
00:32:41,572 --> 00:32:43,405
Unless they're really hungry.

375
00:32:47,528 --> 00:32:49,466
They're here.

376
00:32:56,124 --> 00:32:57,812
Okay, you've seen their graves.
Now let's go.

377
00:32:57,853 --> 00:32:59,394
Hold on.

378
00:33:02,529 --> 00:33:04,690
Do you know the prayer for dead people?

379
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:06,356
You're asking me?

380
00:33:07,755 --> 00:33:12,060
Just say it in Indonesian.
You think God only speaks Arabic?

381
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,200
What did you pray for anyway?

382
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:30,983
So that they rest in peace.

383
00:33:32,086 --> 00:33:34,005
Did you pray
so you can get their fortune?

384
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:37,166
That too.

385
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,035
Good.

386
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:54,419
Maya, why are there
so many children's graves?

387
00:33:56,499 --> 00:34:00,538
Maybe they're not children,
just really tiny graves.

388
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:03,513
Just look at the dates.

389
00:34:05,812 --> 00:34:08,853
They didn't even have names.

390
00:34:10,087 --> 00:34:12,503
What is up with your village, Maya?

391
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,458
HARJOSARI CEMETERY

392
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:35,095
COURTESY OF THE DONOWONGSO

393
00:34:35,564 --> 00:34:38,489
It seems that the villagers
don't really like your family.

394
00:35:17,404 --> 00:35:19,042
Dini!

395
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:19,922
What?

396
00:35:19,963 --> 00:35:21,546
Did you hear something?

397
00:35:23,148 --> 00:35:24,773
Yes.

398
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:26,701
I heard your annoying voice.

399
00:35:26,742 --> 00:35:28,449
I'm serious.

400
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:31,257
I'm so tired.

401
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:34,247
How can you sleep
in a dusty bed like this?

402
00:35:34,486 --> 00:35:35,997
Shut up.

403
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,439
Shit.

404
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:34,318
Dear Almighty.

405
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:41,505
Give me pain that I can bear.

406
00:39:10,513 --> 00:39:11,917
What are you doing?

407
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:14,101
I think someone just died.

408
00:39:14,142 --> 00:39:15,474
Again?

409
00:39:23,621 --> 00:39:25,950
Maya, where are you going?

410
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:46,234
Within two days, two people have died.

411
00:39:46,275 --> 00:39:48,943
No wonder this village seems empty.

412
00:40:01,415 --> 00:40:02,732
Wait!

413
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:05,179
What are we going to say?

414
00:40:05,825 --> 00:40:07,130
Just be cool.

415
00:40:20,689 --> 00:40:23,294
I heard that you came
to my house to see me.

416
00:40:23,335 --> 00:40:24,793
Yes, Sir.

417
00:40:26,765 --> 00:40:28,885
You are writing a book
about Wayang (Javanese shadow puppetry)?

418
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,825
For our university, Sir.
We are university students.

419
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,872
Why do you choose this village?

420
00:40:42,763 --> 00:40:47,445
We've visited other villages
that are still performing Wayang.

421
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:51,277
Then we heard about you.
So we came here.

422
00:40:58,278 --> 00:41:00,490
How old are the both of you?

423
00:41:00,531 --> 00:41:01,982
We're 20 years old, Sir.

424
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:08,076
We are very sorry to come
during an inconvenient time.

425
00:41:08,117 --> 00:41:09,802
Don't worry about it.

426
00:41:11,497 --> 00:41:16,365
Come to my house if you want to talk.

427
00:41:18,305 --> 00:41:20,263
Thank you so much, Sir.

428
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:25,709
We need to leave this village now.

429
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:26,925
What?

430
00:41:26,966 --> 00:41:28,125
This place creeps me out.

431
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:29,772
They look like
they're going to eat us alive,...

432
00:41:29,813 --> 00:41:31,167
...and someone dies here
on a daily basis.

433
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:32,250
Probably just a coincidence.

434
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:33,667
No way.

435
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:35,781
If you're desperate
about your inheritance,...

436
00:41:35,822 --> 00:41:38,334
...we can send someone to come here
and take care of it.

437
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:40,917
You think we can afford that?

438
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:44,292
We're broke.
We can't even pay rent this month.

439
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:46,500
We'll figure something out.
We always do.

440
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:48,992
Look, we're here now.
We just have to stay a little longer.

441
00:41:49,033 --> 00:41:50,625
We may not have to spend another night.

442
00:41:50,666 --> 00:41:53,688
We'll ask Ki Saptadi if the house
actually belongs to my family.

443
00:41:53,729 --> 00:41:55,068
Then, we go.

444
00:41:58,325 --> 00:41:59,792
We have to ask him in a gentle manner.

445
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:01,000
Yes, a very gentle way.

446
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:03,083
I'm not sure of this idea.

447
00:42:03,124 --> 00:42:05,458
Come on, Din. We can do this.

448
00:42:05,865 --> 00:42:08,412
How are you going to ask him
about the house...

449
00:42:08,453 --> 00:42:10,625
...without revealing that you're Rahayu?

450
00:42:10,666 --> 00:42:13,917
It's risky.
Someone tried to kill you, remember?

451
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:16,334
And most likely
it was because of the house.

452
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:19,875
Understood. So let's just play along
as students.

453
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:23,060
Nobody kills students.

454
00:42:27,552 --> 00:42:29,000
I'm gonna go back to the house.

455
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:31,244
I stink like a dead racoon.
I should take a shower.

456
00:42:31,285 --> 00:42:33,146
Fine. I'll find us something to eat.

457
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:59,286
Hi, can I buy some food?

458
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,833
To eat here or to go?

459
00:43:03,874 --> 00:43:05,459
Two to go, please.

460
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:11,255
Rice with egg and vegetables.

461
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:17,500
Do you know anything
about that big abandoned house?

462
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:19,238
Do you know who it belongs to?

463
00:43:19,279 --> 00:43:25,596
A family used to live there
when I was still a child.

464
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:26,720
Who?

465
00:43:27,363 --> 00:43:29,488
(speaking in Javanese)

466
00:43:30,539 --> 00:43:31,955
What did she say?

467
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:36,661
(speaking in Javanese)

468
00:43:37,521 --> 00:43:40,874
My grandma said it's a house of disease.

469
00:43:41,568 --> 00:43:42,604
What does she mean?

470
00:43:42,645 --> 00:43:47,436
She said devils used to live there
and left a horrendous disease.

471
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,240
We heard that you two
spent a night here.

472
00:44:35,028 --> 00:44:36,319
It's not allowed, Miss.

473
00:44:36,916 --> 00:44:40,250
So sorry.
We couldn't find another place.

474
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:45,541
This old house
has been abandoned for a long time.

475
00:44:46,705 --> 00:44:49,663
It's not safe. The roof might fall off.

476
00:44:50,247 --> 00:44:52,583
I know. Thank you for your concern.
We're leaving soon.

477
00:44:52,624 --> 00:44:58,124
I know it's a pity
a house this big is unoccupied.

478
00:44:58,754 --> 00:45:03,435
But it doesn't belong to us.
So we can't use it.

479
00:45:04,718 --> 00:45:06,593
Who does it belong to?

480
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:10,622
The heir of this family. A girl.

481
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:14,416
Ki Saptadi has all of the documents.

482
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:18,699
He has been waiting
for the girl to claim it...

483
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:21,583
...so he can give back
all of the documents.

484
00:45:21,624 --> 00:45:24,999
So this house will no longer
be his responsibility.

485
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:31,091
Is the girl's name Rahayu?

486
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:34,466
Yes. How do you know?

487
00:45:35,867 --> 00:45:37,521
Because...

488
00:45:39,356 --> 00:45:41,013
...I am Rahayu.

489
00:45:47,943 --> 00:45:55,263
Well, Ki Saptadi is about to go
to another village.

490
00:45:55,304 --> 00:46:02,255
If you can meet him now,
he can give you the documents.

491
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:09,113
Where's your friend?

492
00:46:09,154 --> 00:46:11,646
She's getting us something to eat.

493
00:46:11,687 --> 00:46:14,693
She really is a college student.
I'm accompanying her.

494
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,084
Well, it's up to you.

495
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:24,412
If you want to wait until Ki Saptadi
is back from his trip,...

496
00:46:24,453 --> 00:46:29,209
...he'll return in three days.

497
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,042
Three days?

498
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:34,717
But earlier today he told us
to come to his house tonight...

499
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:36,834
...so my friend could ask him
some questions for her thesis.

500
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:39,333
Yes, that was before.

501
00:46:39,669 --> 00:46:42,674
But he got a sudden invitation
to perform in another village.

502
00:46:43,262 --> 00:46:45,161
And it's quite far from here.

503
00:46:47,177 --> 00:46:50,552
Okay, then. I'll go meet him now.

504
00:46:51,332 --> 00:46:52,902
We can take you to him.

505
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:54,832
I know where he lives.

506
00:46:55,162 --> 00:47:01,257
No, he is at a villager's house.
Not far from here.

507
00:47:04,328 --> 00:47:07,161
Come, we'll take you there.

508
00:47:12,015 --> 00:47:13,334
Are we still far?

509
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:15,443
Just a little bit more.

510
00:47:18,416 --> 00:47:20,276
Why are we not talking the main road?

511
00:47:20,317 --> 00:47:23,150
It's closer through here.

512
00:47:38,663 --> 00:47:41,740
I think I'd better get back.
My friend is waiting for me.

513
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:47,121
What the hell?

514
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:00,417
Listen.

515
00:48:00,458 --> 00:48:01,976
You don't have to rape me.

516
00:48:02,017 --> 00:48:05,208
I'm no virgin.
All you have to do is ask.

517
00:48:09,145 --> 00:48:10,779
Don't cut her skin.

518
00:49:15,009 --> 00:49:16,216
Dini?

519
00:49:21,963 --> 00:49:23,338
Dini?

520
00:49:24,102 --> 00:49:26,372
I brought food. Aren't you hungry?

521
00:49:36,115 --> 00:49:40,070
<i>The number you're calling
is not active or out of coverage area.</i>

522
00:49:40,111 --> 00:49:42,166
<i>Please try again in a few minutes.</i>

523
00:50:15,614 --> 00:50:18,052
Please...

524
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:33,661
What do you want?

525
00:50:34,669 --> 00:50:36,791
Please let me go.

526
00:50:37,255 --> 00:50:40,693
What can I do for you
to let me go? Please...

527
00:50:47,035 --> 00:50:51,316
Sir! Please help me, Sir!

528
00:50:51,357 --> 00:50:53,292
I don't know what I did wrong.

529
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:58,302
If I ever wronged you,
please forgive me, Sir. I beg you...

530
00:51:06,812 --> 00:51:08,740
Rahayu...

531
00:51:11,655 --> 00:51:12,990
We're ready, Sir.

532
00:51:24,541 --> 00:51:26,292
Mother…

533
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,607
Please help me, Ma'am!

534
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:35,021
What are you up to?

535
00:51:47,692 --> 00:51:50,192
There are two women
who are headed into labor soon.

536
00:51:50,661 --> 00:51:54,529
If we hurry, we might be able
to save their babies.

537
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:45,536
I assumed you weren't coming.

538
00:52:46,074 --> 00:52:49,157
Are you here for the interview?

539
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:53,123
Actually, I'm looking for my friend.

540
00:52:53,164 --> 00:52:55,039
The one who was with me earlier
when we met.

541
00:52:55,976 --> 00:52:57,638
Why is she not with you?

542
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:00,319
I don't know. I left to buy some food...

543
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,529
...and when I returned
she wasn't at the house.

544
00:53:04,958 --> 00:53:07,791
I will ask someone to look for her.

545
00:53:08,687 --> 00:53:13,349
You can wait for her here if you want.

546
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:20,773
That's okay. Thank you for your help.

547
00:53:20,814 --> 00:53:23,064
But I want to keep looking for her.

548
00:53:24,017 --> 00:53:27,591
Very well.
I hope you're able to find her soon.

549
00:53:29,075 --> 00:53:30,310
Thank you, Sir.

550
00:53:30,351 --> 00:53:31,740
You're welcome.

551
00:57:13,432 --> 00:57:15,807
Our baby is going to be alright.

552
00:57:46,937 --> 00:57:49,245
Excuse me, Miss.

553
00:57:49,286 --> 00:57:51,958
You can watch from the other side, Miss.

554
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:56,675
I want to ask Ki Saptadi
if he has any information...

555
00:57:56,716 --> 00:57:58,677
...on my missing friend.

556
00:57:59,755 --> 00:58:04,667
We've looked for her everywhere,
but we weren't able to find her.

557
00:58:04,708 --> 00:58:06,450
We'll look again
after this show finishes.

558
00:58:08,806 --> 00:58:11,927
All right. Thank you.

559
00:59:00,249 --> 00:59:03,005
<i>The number you are calling
is not active.</i>

560
00:59:18,658 --> 00:59:22,490
Where are you, Dini?

561
00:59:44,062 --> 00:59:47,154
A woman is going into labour.
Come and see.

562
00:59:59,791 --> 01:00:05,155
Push.

563
01:00:05,196 --> 01:00:10,334
A little bit more. Come on.

564
01:00:10,375 --> 01:00:15,000
Push.

565
01:00:15,041 --> 01:00:19,357
Just one more push. You can do it.

566
01:01:10,247 --> 01:01:12,901
You said my baby
was going to be healthy!

567
01:01:12,942 --> 01:01:14,737
You're a liar!

568
01:01:14,778 --> 01:01:16,115
A liar!

569
01:01:23,908 --> 01:01:31,552
I'm doing all I can to help you
and everybody in this village.

570
01:01:34,937 --> 01:01:36,978
Damn you!

571
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:45,919
Will my baby still be cursed?

572
01:02:14,529 --> 01:02:16,125
What are you doing here?

573
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:17,943
I'm just wandering around.

574
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,287
Go home.

575
01:02:19,328 --> 01:02:21,846
I want to see the baby.

576
01:02:21,887 --> 01:02:23,303
Go home!

577
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:37,476
Come with me.

578
01:02:40,258 --> 01:02:42,206
Don't worry.

579
01:02:42,247 --> 01:02:44,583
I'm not like the others.

580
01:02:45,062 --> 01:02:46,404
Come.

581
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:56,694
What's going on in this village?

582
01:02:57,232 --> 01:02:59,417
What's wrong with the babies?

583
01:02:59,458 --> 01:03:04,271
I will tell you. Come.

584
01:03:05,187 --> 01:03:07,562
I have to find my friend.

585
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:11,041
I will help you look for her.

586
01:03:11,463 --> 01:03:13,865
But for now you have to hide.

587
01:03:14,429 --> 01:03:16,552
It's not safe.

588
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:32,846
Come. I live by myself.

589
01:03:32,887 --> 01:03:36,982
Please come in. Don't worry.

590
01:03:45,741 --> 01:03:47,661
My name is Ratih.

591
01:03:49,215 --> 01:03:51,638
I'm not a bad person.

592
01:03:52,618 --> 01:03:55,060
The baby I saw…

593
01:03:56,388 --> 01:03:58,256
It's cursed.

594
01:03:58,297 --> 01:03:59,380
What?

595
01:03:59,791 --> 01:04:03,250
This whole village is cursed.

596
01:04:03,291 --> 01:04:05,957
A cursed village? In this day and age?

597
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:15,130
Didn't you notice
anything peculiar about this village?

598
01:04:16,474 --> 01:04:22,175
Haven't you noticed
there are no children here?

599
01:04:22,216 --> 01:04:23,835
I saw three girls last night.

600
01:04:23,876 --> 01:04:25,334
That's impossible.

601
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:30,763
There hasn't been children
in this village in 20 years.

602
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:32,788
What do you mean?

603
01:04:34,275 --> 01:04:38,281
There was once a very rich man
in this village.

604
01:04:38,322 --> 01:04:40,613
He was our village elder.

605
01:04:41,304 --> 01:04:43,732
He and his family lived
in that big abandoned house.

606
01:04:44,625 --> 01:04:47,250
They had many servants.

607
01:04:47,762 --> 01:04:53,122
One of them was Nyi Misni,
Ki Saptadi's mother.

608
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:56,291
The village elder had a son.

609
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:59,255
His name was Ki Donowongso.

610
01:05:05,218 --> 01:05:11,583
When his father died,
Ki Donowongso inherited all the wealth.

611
01:05:13,513 --> 01:05:19,050
He was not only rich,
but also a brilliant puppet master.

612
01:05:19,091 --> 01:05:22,568
He was so good
at making the puppets, too.

613
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:26,646
He was also famous
among the neighbouring villages.

614
01:05:29,888 --> 01:05:35,583
Then there was Nyai Shinta,
the most beautiful woman in the village.

615
01:05:35,961 --> 01:05:38,961
All the men wished to be her husband.

616
01:05:39,531 --> 01:05:43,031
But Ki Donowongso
succeeded in marrying Nyai Shinta.

617
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:48,419
It was a huge wedding.
The party lasted for seven days.

618
01:05:51,552 --> 01:05:55,108
Unfortunately,
after three years of marriage,...

619
01:05:55,149 --> 01:05:58,115
...they could not bear a child.

620
01:05:59,325 --> 01:06:05,654
Nyai Shinta was depressed and ashamed.

621
01:06:07,357 --> 01:06:14,769
Finally, after five years of trying,
Nyai Shinta got pregnant.

622
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:20,763
Ki Donowongso
really took care of his wife.

623
01:06:21,771 --> 01:06:25,789
They held a party every Saturday night.

624
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:29,466
He would perform
with his puppets all night long.

625
01:06:37,615 --> 01:06:39,244
The weird thing is,...

626
01:06:39,285 --> 01:06:44,365
...no one knew about
the baby's condition after it was born.

627
01:06:45,564 --> 01:06:48,689
And no one ever saw the baby.

628
01:06:49,103 --> 01:06:50,622
What do you mean?

629
01:06:52,997 --> 01:06:55,896
The baby was born without skin.

630
01:07:01,107 --> 01:07:04,957
Since then, Ki Donowongso refused
to mingle with the villagers.

631
01:07:06,693 --> 01:07:08,718
Not long after that,...

632
01:07:08,759 --> 01:07:14,052
...a five-year-old girl
in the village went missing.

633
01:07:15,458 --> 01:07:17,708
She was never found.

634
01:07:18,255 --> 01:07:23,794
Soon after that,
two more girls went missing.

635
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:32,279
One day, the villagers saw
Ki Donowongso's baby for the first time.

636
01:07:34,564 --> 01:07:37,730
She looked so healthy, so beautiful.

637
01:07:39,068 --> 01:07:42,916
It was only then that the village
learned the baby was named Rahayu.

638
01:07:44,247 --> 01:07:46,909
A rumor started to spread
among the villagers.

639
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:50,006
Saying that Rahayu's father
had something to do...

640
01:07:50,047 --> 01:07:53,185
...with the three missing girls.

641
01:07:54,107 --> 01:07:58,917
But no one dared to confront him.

642
01:07:58,958 --> 01:08:02,122
Until one night…

643
01:08:02,732 --> 01:08:07,375
Ki Saptadi said Ki Donowongso
had been practicing black magic,...

644
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:13,099
...making a pact with the devil
to protect his daughter.

645
01:08:15,234 --> 01:08:17,234
But then he went mad.

646
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:46,963
It was said that a loyal servant
took his daughter away to the city.

647
01:08:47,004 --> 01:08:51,125
And ever since that day,
the village has been cursed.

648
01:08:51,166 --> 01:08:56,957
Every baby has been born without skin.

649
01:08:58,556 --> 01:09:00,681
Why do they have to kill the babies?

650
01:09:02,419 --> 01:09:08,084
Because if they were allowed to live,
they would be living in misery.

651
01:09:08,125 --> 01:09:12,166
You don't know that.
Perhaps there is a cure.

652
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:16,965
No. There's one baby
who was allowed to live.

653
01:09:17,543 --> 01:09:19,668
He now lives in the forest.

654
01:09:20,687 --> 01:09:22,812
Uncured and in constant pain.

655
01:09:23,716 --> 01:09:30,185
Ki Saptadi said
in order to lift the curse,...

656
01:09:30,226 --> 01:09:34,357
...the first girl who got the disease,
Rahayu, has to be skinned...

657
01:09:34,398 --> 01:09:39,060
...and her skin has to be made
into leather puppets.

658
01:09:44,668 --> 01:09:48,404
Why do the villagers
believe in Ki Saptadi's words?

659
01:09:50,669 --> 01:09:54,521
Who else do we have to look up to here?

660
01:09:57,341 --> 01:10:03,886
Is there anything else we should do?

661
01:10:03,927 --> 01:10:06,021
Did we miss something?

662
01:10:09,137 --> 01:10:12,575
We got the wrong girl!

663
01:10:21,728 --> 01:10:23,561
You must be hungry.
I'll get you some food.

664
01:10:24,916 --> 01:10:26,792
No, I'm okay. Thank you.

665
01:10:26,833 --> 01:10:28,708
I'll get you some rice.

666
01:11:25,616 --> 01:11:27,741
Who's that in the picture?

667
01:11:37,666 --> 01:11:39,167
My husband.

668
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:40,755
Listen up!

669
01:11:41,458 --> 01:11:46,084
The woman we've been looking for
is here in this village.

670
01:11:46,125 --> 01:11:47,167
Yes!

671
01:11:47,208 --> 01:11:49,251
You know what she looks like.

672
01:11:49,292 --> 01:11:50,376
Yes!

673
01:11:50,417 --> 01:11:51,751
Get her!

674
01:11:51,792 --> 01:11:54,279
Look for the girl!

675
01:11:55,029 --> 01:11:56,916
Block all the village's exits.

676
01:11:57,685 --> 01:12:02,458
The curse will be lifted soon!

677
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:05,811
Where is your husband now?

678
01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:11,987
He went to the city three months ago.

679
01:12:12,028 --> 01:12:14,028
He was looking for a cure.

680
01:12:15,395 --> 01:12:17,232
Cure for what?

681
01:12:47,236 --> 01:12:49,236
Can you feel that?

682
01:12:53,685 --> 01:12:58,146
My great grandmother, whom you met
at the kiosk, is a good shaman.

683
01:12:59,091 --> 01:13:04,582
She said if someone made a pact
with the devil,...

684
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:09,456
...and a curse is born,
it can never be reversed.

685
01:13:09,497 --> 01:13:11,622
It will only transform
into another curse.

686
01:13:13,395 --> 01:13:19,447
That's why I don't believe
in killing you, Rahayu.

687
01:13:19,488 --> 01:13:22,618
It will not lift the curse.

688
01:13:32,374 --> 01:13:37,442
And that's why I asked my husband
to search for a cure in the city.

689
01:13:38,165 --> 01:13:40,591
I believe he will be able to find it.

690
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,603
Did you see the city girl?

691
01:13:58,989 --> 01:14:00,445
City girl?

692
01:14:00,486 --> 01:14:04,388
Yes, two city girls came to our village.

693
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:07,000
One of them is Ki Donowongso's daughter.

694
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:11,250
Ki Saptadi killed the other one.
The wrong one.

695
01:14:11,291 --> 01:14:15,286
They skinned her, turned her skin
into leather puppets. What a waste.

696
01:14:17,754 --> 01:14:19,170
What do you think you're doing?

697
01:14:20,468 --> 01:14:22,671
You won't share some food
with your neighbors now?

698
01:14:22,712 --> 01:14:25,273
No. Please go.

699
01:14:25,314 --> 01:14:27,189
Why are you so hostile?

700
01:14:28,731 --> 01:14:33,374
Are you lonely because your husband
has been away long?

701
01:14:34,875 --> 01:14:37,091
Do you want me to stay with you tonight?

702
01:14:38,119 --> 01:14:41,708
How long since you've seen
a man's erection?

703
01:14:46,431 --> 01:14:47,505
Get out.

704
01:14:47,962 --> 01:14:51,239
Just stab me.

705
01:14:57,038 --> 01:14:59,636
Or I'll kill myself.

706
01:14:59,677 --> 01:15:06,239
Then my ghost will haunt you
for the rest of your life.

707
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:17,958
Pigs!

708
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:21,786
Come on, Miss.

709
01:15:35,603 --> 01:15:40,103
I'm so sorry about your friend.

710
01:15:40,744 --> 01:15:43,494
I need to get out of this village
as soon as possible.

711
01:15:44,388 --> 01:15:50,136
Stay here for a while.
It's not safe out there.

712
01:15:50,177 --> 01:15:52,125
They won't come again.

713
01:15:52,166 --> 01:15:54,249
We don't know that.

714
01:15:54,567 --> 01:15:58,457
At least if I run now, I might be able
to escape from the villagers.

715
01:16:00,929 --> 01:16:02,345
Dini...

716
01:16:05,703 --> 01:16:09,044
Dini. My best friend.

717
01:16:11,481 --> 01:16:14,545
This is all my fault.

718
01:16:14,586 --> 01:16:18,091
No, it's not.

719
01:16:18,911 --> 01:16:23,755
It's the work of the devil
and weak humans.

720
01:16:25,572 --> 01:16:27,864
Do you have a mobile phone?

721
01:16:59,606 --> 01:17:00,856
Hello?

722
01:17:01,497 --> 01:17:09,167
Miss? I'm with a police officer.
We're on our way.

723
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:13,403
We're taking a motorbike so it's faster.
We're almost there.

724
01:17:13,666 --> 01:17:15,717
Thank you. I'll be there.

725
01:17:15,758 --> 01:17:16,817
They're almost there.

726
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:21,472
She said to meet her
at the North Entrance.

727
01:17:21,513 --> 01:17:22,875
I know where it is.

728
01:17:22,916 --> 01:17:24,751
Then, can we drive faster?

729
01:17:24,792 --> 01:17:26,208
This the fastest I can go.

730
01:17:41,892 --> 01:17:44,145
I've met your husband.

731
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:48,833
He tried to kill me.

732
01:17:49,528 --> 01:17:52,958
I was working and he came to me.
He tried to kill me.

733
01:17:54,621 --> 01:17:57,755
He was shot by the policeman, and died.

734
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:06,419
Please forgive me, Ratih.

735
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:18,084
Is this it?

736
01:18:18,125 --> 01:18:19,817
Yes, this is the North Entrance.

737
01:18:29,935 --> 01:18:31,330
Brother Suryo.

738
01:18:31,371 --> 01:18:32,880
Evening, Brother.

739
01:18:34,122 --> 01:18:35,830
Bambang?

740
01:18:36,724 --> 01:18:40,419
I told you to stay put.
I can handle this by myself.

741
01:18:41,301 --> 01:18:43,187
We just want to help.

742
01:18:43,228 --> 01:18:44,936
Who are you, people?

743
01:18:45,415 --> 01:18:47,123
We're from this village.

744
01:18:47,583 --> 01:18:49,151
You know them?

745
01:18:49,192 --> 01:18:54,005
I'm from here, too. Me and my wife.

746
01:18:55,028 --> 01:18:56,736
Didn't I tell you?

747
01:18:57,422 --> 01:18:59,052
No, you didn't.

748
01:19:00,099 --> 01:19:01,917
- Listen, Mister?
- I'm Nano.

749
01:19:01,958 --> 01:19:03,156
Don't worry, Mr. Nano.

750
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:06,126
Our village is safe
and the villagers are friendly.

751
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:08,917
Give me your phone.

752
01:19:08,958 --> 01:19:10,001
No.

753
01:19:10,042 --> 01:19:11,345
- Just for a minute.
- No!

754
01:19:11,973 --> 01:19:13,619
Are you testing my patience?

755
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,708
Fuck you!

756
01:19:30,619 --> 01:19:32,667
Over there!

757
01:19:32,708 --> 01:19:34,626
Where is she?

758
01:19:35,629 --> 01:19:36,845
Find her!

759
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:58,375
Sir, help me. People are chasing me.
They want to rape me.

760
01:20:58,416 --> 01:20:59,624
Get in!

761
01:20:59,791 --> 01:21:01,292
I'll just ride at the back.
I don't want them to see me.

762
01:21:01,333 --> 01:21:02,634
Okay, hurry!

763
01:21:14,214 --> 01:21:15,455
Help.

764
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:55,938
Hurry!

765
01:21:55,979 --> 01:21:57,167
Find her!

766
01:21:57,208 --> 01:21:58,587
Don't let her get away!

767
01:22:59,296 --> 01:23:02,937
You will forget.

768
01:23:05,736 --> 01:23:09,117
The unborn shall perish.

769
01:23:20,017 --> 01:23:21,625
Good morning, Miss.

770
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:34,834
She must be here!

771
01:23:34,875 --> 01:23:35,625
Find her! Now!

772
01:23:35,666 --> 01:23:37,290
Come on! She must be here! Get her!

773
01:25:16,875 --> 01:25:17,833
Hurry, find her!

774
01:25:18,083 --> 01:25:19,375
Don't let her get away!

775
01:25:19,416 --> 01:25:20,457
Get her!

776
01:26:33,413 --> 01:26:36,359
Blood for blood.

777
01:27:50,708 --> 01:27:52,209
Hurry!

778
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:53,875
She has nowhere to run!

779
01:28:18,554 --> 01:28:24,624
Bury our skin with our bones,
and the curse will be gone.

780
01:28:25,242 --> 01:28:30,890
Maya! Wake up!
We have to get out of here.

781
01:28:41,703 --> 01:28:43,158
What is that place?

782
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:48,273
It's where Tole lives,
the cursed child who was kept alive.

783
01:28:48,619 --> 01:28:50,202
I want to see him.

784
01:28:50,541 --> 01:28:52,250
You have to go now.

785
01:28:52,291 --> 01:28:54,632
I want to see him.

786
01:29:08,828 --> 01:29:11,913
Who's there?

787
01:29:11,954 --> 01:29:15,204
It's me. Ratih.

788
01:29:16,365 --> 01:29:22,453
I'm hungry. I want food.

789
01:29:25,572 --> 01:29:28,507
Who is that, Ratih?

790
01:29:33,965 --> 01:29:37,257
I will be back with food.

791
01:29:47,567 --> 01:29:49,733
It's all my fault.

792
01:29:50,616 --> 01:29:52,574
It is not.

793
01:29:54,543 --> 01:29:58,459
But I can make things right.

794
01:30:05,113 --> 01:30:07,363
Why are you still helping me?

795
01:30:08,517 --> 01:30:12,183
Hating you will not change anything.

796
01:30:13,661 --> 01:30:16,952
They will hurt you
if they know you're helping me.

797
01:30:17,861 --> 01:30:22,398
They've hurt me all my life.

798
01:30:23,273 --> 01:30:29,648
Let's just do whatever you plan to do.

799
01:30:53,953 --> 01:30:56,036
What is that?

800
01:30:58,689 --> 01:31:00,742
The skin of the missing girls.

801
01:33:13,072 --> 01:33:15,640
Your work here is done.

802
01:33:17,778 --> 01:33:20,656
You must go before it's too late.

803
01:33:21,101 --> 01:33:25,226
I'm not going anywhere
until I know that the curse is gone.

804
01:33:29,153 --> 01:33:31,444
A woman is going into labor tonight.

805
01:33:33,173 --> 01:33:34,632
We'll wait and see.

806
01:33:49,041 --> 01:33:54,541
I used to live in this house.

807
01:34:00,531 --> 01:34:11,929
This is where Donowongso's father
used to fuck me.

808
01:34:13,047 --> 01:34:18,416
This is also where I gave birth
to Saptadi.

809
01:34:19,164 --> 01:34:21,625
Go to the woman who is in labor.

810
01:34:21,666 --> 01:34:24,062
Please go now!

811
01:34:29,234 --> 01:34:38,124
Of course I didn't tell him
that Saptadi was his illegitimate son.

812
01:34:39,223 --> 01:34:43,431
I never asked him
to take any responsibility for Saptadi.

813
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:47,338
I knew my place.

814
01:34:47,889 --> 01:34:51,609
This is all your fault.

815
01:34:52,595 --> 01:34:56,303
Even before I was born,
you tried to destroy me.

816
01:34:56,836 --> 01:35:00,726
You started this curse.

817
01:35:07,983 --> 01:35:09,941
You...

818
01:35:11,085 --> 01:35:14,585
...are a mistake
that I need to erase.

819
01:35:26,743 --> 01:35:28,826
Don't come near me!

820
01:35:30,843 --> 01:35:32,759
Don't come near me!

821
01:35:34,208 --> 01:35:35,414
Stay away!

822
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:23,770
Sir, please, let me go.

823
01:36:25,797 --> 01:36:29,609
Sir, please, let me go home.

824
01:36:29,650 --> 01:36:31,828
We have to do this.

825
01:36:32,883 --> 01:36:34,088
Please understand.

826
01:36:34,129 --> 01:36:36,961
Sir, everything is alright now.

827
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:40,515
There will be no more curse.

828
01:36:40,875 --> 01:36:43,648
No more babies
will be born without skin.

829
01:36:46,603 --> 01:36:48,068
What?

830
01:36:48,109 --> 01:36:51,998
The three little girls,
the ones that were never found...

831
01:36:52,039 --> 01:36:54,792
My father buried them inside the house.

832
01:36:54,833 --> 01:36:57,578
In the basement.
Their spirits came to me.

833
01:36:58,617 --> 01:37:01,610
They asked me to bury the puppets
that were made from their skin...

834
01:37:01,651 --> 01:37:04,149
...in the same location
where their bones were buried.

835
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:05,667
So they can rest in peace.

836
01:37:05,708 --> 01:37:07,874
I've done everything
that they asked me to do.

837
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:14,172
Go look. The puppets are gone
from your house.

838
01:37:18,164 --> 01:37:20,330
Please, Sir.

839
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:23,706
Please, Sir. I'm not lying.

840
01:37:28,531 --> 01:37:32,484
Please, Sir. I'm actually your daughter.

841
01:37:34,504 --> 01:37:36,068
What did you say?

842
01:37:36,109 --> 01:37:38,523
I'm your daughter.

843
01:37:39,609 --> 01:37:43,125
I know everything.
I am your child, Father.

844
01:37:43,166 --> 01:37:45,502
Yours and Nyai Shinta's.

845
01:37:45,543 --> 01:37:47,929
Grandma put a spell on you to forget.

846
01:37:48,453 --> 01:37:49,994
Don't listen to her!

847
01:37:50,257 --> 01:37:54,916
Grandmother! What have I done
to deserve this?

848
01:37:56,664 --> 01:38:01,334
I've been living in misery all my life.

849
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:05,866
You brought me into this world.
Now you want to kill me.

850
01:38:05,907 --> 01:38:08,657
Shut up!

851
01:38:16,934 --> 01:38:19,225
Is this true, Mother?

852
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:30,695
This is all your fault.

853
01:38:33,130 --> 01:38:36,312
You dare to talk that way
to your mother?

854
01:38:36,353 --> 01:38:38,929
Enough!

855
01:38:41,188 --> 01:38:46,422
I've had enough with you
controlling my life.

856
01:38:52,008 --> 01:38:55,515
It's her, or your mother.

857
01:38:58,375 --> 01:39:01,916
My wife's in labor, Sir.

858
01:39:06,004 --> 01:39:09,125
It's me or her!

859
01:39:10,043 --> 01:39:11,250
Father...

860
01:39:14,116 --> 01:39:16,406
The baby's healthy!

861
01:39:17,850 --> 01:39:19,101
Please...

862
01:39:19,142 --> 01:39:20,392
Oh Dear...

863
01:39:21,463 --> 01:39:24,117
Give me back my baby!

864
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:27,998
Please.

865
01:39:28,819 --> 01:39:30,343
You have to die!

866
01:40:25,226 --> 01:40:26,976
Our child.

867
01:40:39,290 --> 01:40:41,084
You have to go now.

868
01:40:41,125 --> 01:40:42,500
Come with me.

869
01:40:42,541 --> 01:40:44,918
It doesn't matter where I go.
My life will be the same.

870
01:40:44,959 --> 01:40:46,640
Go!

871
01:41:59,044 --> 01:42:01,140
Go! Go now!

872
01:42:04,757 --> 01:42:06,906
Hurry!

873
01:42:45,070 --> 01:42:47,234
The baby is healthy.

874
01:42:50,665 --> 01:42:53,257
Of course he is.

875
01:42:54,265 --> 01:42:57,109
He keeps kicking me, honey.

876
01:42:58,617 --> 01:43:00,812
Maybe he hates me.

877
01:43:01,436 --> 01:43:03,125
Of course he hates you.

878
01:43:03,843 --> 01:43:05,459
He knows that you've knocked me up.

879
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:07,937
And are putting me through a hard time.

880
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,701
This is what happens to pregnant women.

881
01:43:11,742 --> 01:43:14,367
We pee a lot. The joy.

882
01:43:17,778 --> 01:43:19,625
Be careful, Love.

883
01:44:13,710 --> 01:44:15,140
What happened?

884
01:44:16,539 --> 01:44:18,585
What happened to the baby?

885
01:44:18,626 --> 01:44:22,093
Where's the baby?

885
01:44:23,305 --> 01:45:23,829
