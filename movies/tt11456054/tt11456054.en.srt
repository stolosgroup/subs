3
00:01:17,826 --> 00:01:19,677
In between breath,

4
00:01:21,036 --> 00:01:22,568
take the shot.

5
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:48,837
That was...

6
00:01:48,862 --> 00:01:53,469
I was hoping we wouldn't have to deal
with this scenario so early in our lessons.

7
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,671
There is unfinished
business you need to tend to.

8
00:01:58,276 --> 00:02:01,036
It's tempting to let nature
run its course.

9
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:03,778
Lungs will fill with blood.

10
00:02:04,716 --> 00:02:08,567
Animals die of natural death
but with that process

11
00:02:08,592 --> 00:02:10,184
comes extreme pain.

12
00:02:11,427 --> 00:02:13,888
This isn't right to let
an animal suffer for a...

13
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:19,151
Hey.

14
00:02:21,457 --> 00:02:22,770
Zoe.

15
00:02:25,426 --> 00:02:26,161
Here.

16
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:28,070
Let me help you.

17
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:08,330
Slow down honey, it's not a race.

18
00:03:14,424 --> 00:03:15,596
Isn't it?

19
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,173
Aren't we getting close
to seeing your prom?

20
00:03:21,892 --> 00:03:23,024
Mom.

21
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,985
- You have anyone in your sights?
- I mean it. Stop.

22
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,126
Stop what?

23
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,637
Was just talking to a... fly.

24
00:03:33,608 --> 00:03:35,796
You've done really good out there, kid.

25
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:39,219
I mean, the size of that deer,
we're gonna be eating venison all summer.

26
00:03:39,244 --> 00:03:41,383
- All in a days work.
- Yeah.

27
00:03:42,094 --> 00:03:44,149
And all before 0800.

28
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:48,477
Yeah.

29
00:03:49,124 --> 00:03:50,352
Coffee.

30
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:05,678
Hey, Lewis can wait a minute, huh?

31
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:06,708
For what?

32
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,312
I think we need to see somebody again.

33
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:13,858
And by we, you mean me?

34
00:04:13,883 --> 00:04:15,968
No, I mean us. Listen.

35
00:04:15,993 --> 00:04:19,685
Everyday still feels like
it just happened.

36
00:04:20,992 --> 00:04:23,046
And honey, you are so angry.

37
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:24,349
You are so...

38
00:04:24,873 --> 00:04:26,123
- not!
- Hey.

39
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:27,920
That look in your eyes.

40
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:30,037
Guys in my unit had that look.

41
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:31,912
Not everything is about the war.

42
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,435
You're cutting yourself off

43
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:37,742
from everything you care about.

44
00:04:38,926 --> 00:04:40,420
And you're so guarded all the time--

45
00:04:40,561 --> 00:04:43,159
Maybe there's a brochure
you can give me so I can go?

46
00:04:43,665 --> 00:04:46,553
You're 17 years old
and you gave up your cell phone?

47
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,360
Well, think of all the money you've saved.

48
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:50,407
Take off my jacket.

49
00:04:51,977 --> 00:04:53,902
You go out into the word

50
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:56,897
without that jacket.

51
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:02,043
Should be easy for you
if you're really not at war.

52
00:05:04,313 --> 00:05:07,053
Sorry, not breaking, just entering.

53
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:11,235
- I did knock.
- Yeah. It's cool.

54
00:05:12,132 --> 00:05:13,654
I'm ready.

55
00:05:16,521 --> 00:05:17,323
Lewis.

56
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:19,551
- Morning, Mr. Hull.
- Morning.

57
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:27,376
You know, back there with your Dad
I totally saved you intentionally.

58
00:05:27,603 --> 00:05:28,840
You intentionally saved me?

59
00:05:28,982 --> 00:05:31,281
Oh yeah. I mean
it was a calculated risk, but...

60
00:05:31,446 --> 00:05:32,920
Really? Explain.

61
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:35,324
Well, number one:

62
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:38,395
you were saying how things
are getting more and more heated

63
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,014
between you and your pops lately.

64
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:41,772
And "B". You know you were...

65
00:05:41,857 --> 00:05:43,844
You started with numbers but continue.

66
00:05:45,627 --> 00:05:46,958
And two:

67
00:05:47,332 --> 00:05:49,054
you usually come out
right when I honk,

68
00:05:49,202 --> 00:05:52,873
but when you didn't, I assumed
that maybe he had you cornered and so...

69
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:54,902
I engaged.

70
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:56,999
You engaged?

71
00:05:57,132 --> 00:06:00,061
- I mean that's how he would say it, right?
- You engaged, yeah.

72
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:03,955
What the hell?

73
00:06:05,371 --> 00:06:07,795
Rory Mocun, Chaz Harting.

74
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:11,918
And AJ Turners in the back,
like an asshole casserole.

75
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,497
They're like roaming soldiers

76
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,194
who don't realize that their empire
is crumbling in just a few days.

77
00:06:18,342 --> 00:06:21,568
Or they do realize it
and they are totally freaking out.

78
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:31,495
Okay, that just like, looks like
one of their faces.

79
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,367
Hello!

80
00:06:34,698 --> 00:06:36,915
You freaks fucking or what?

81
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:41,791
Hey, we know that you're hurting, Roy.

82
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:44,897
OK? We know Mommy,
she didn't hug you enough.

83
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:47,430
And Daddy never said he was proud.

84
00:06:47,892 --> 00:06:52,253
We don't need to hide behind
stereotypical cave male aggression.

85
00:06:52,486 --> 00:06:54,690
We reach out to that
scared little boy inside,

86
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:55,736
don't push him away.

87
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,087
They are actually pushing us
off the road now.

88
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,273
Thanks guys. Stay well.

89
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,940
Why am I always this guy, huh?

90
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,338
Guy who pulls into the dirt...

91
00:07:12,663 --> 00:07:14,568
Because you're smart and safe.

92
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:16,239
- Yeah, well...
- And not a total asshole.

93
00:07:16,386 --> 00:07:17,765
I hate that about me.

94
00:07:27,241 --> 00:07:28,781
Is that Chris Jelick over there?

95
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,275
Is he doing something
completely fucking weird?

96
00:07:31,398 --> 00:07:32,838
- Yeah.
- Then yes.

97
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:38,658
It's fine, just let it rest a minute.

98
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,502
Yeah, now, that's Chris Jelick.

99
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:49,749
'Cause that is definitely
Tristan Voy's rapemobile.

100
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,609
We'll see all kinds of dumb stuff today.

101
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:53,628
What do you mean?

102
00:07:53,815 --> 00:07:55,581
Hello? Senior prank day.

103
00:07:56,269 --> 00:08:00,379
So the swim captain
will have Thai food delivered to class

104
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:03,397
and Becky Vaughn will set up her home-made
slip'n'slide near the auditorium.

105
00:08:03,422 --> 00:08:06,651
And someone with a tiny car
will try to park it inside the lobby.

106
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:11,650
God, and even stupider
turn of promposals.

107
00:08:12,776 --> 00:08:14,827
Yeah. Yeah. I know. Right.

108
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:16,089
Ew.

109
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:27,646
- You can try it now.
- What? Like..?

110
00:08:28,055 --> 00:08:28,855
The engine.

111
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:31,126
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

112
00:08:41,414 --> 00:08:43,988
Okay, what is this, middle school?

113
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:45,893
Fuck.

114
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,384
This is bullshit.

115
00:08:58,045 --> 00:09:00,159
Giant person. When I'm in pictures.

116
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,333
Even though I'm actually really small.
But no one needs to know that.

117
00:09:03,387 --> 00:09:04,238
Bye now.

118
00:09:04,287 --> 00:09:05,726
Wait. Where are you going?

119
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:07,650
Your locker is this way.

120
00:09:07,796 --> 00:09:10,507
Yeah, I know where my locker's at.
Didn't you hear the bell?

121
00:09:10,972 --> 00:09:14,761
Your locker is by the Yearbook office
and I need your eye for some new layouts.

122
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:17,596
- Okay, can it wait till after lunch?
- Yeah, of course.

123
00:09:20,835 --> 00:09:23,535
- You're being really weird.
- I'm just stressed out.

124
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:26,053
Maybe I should've never agreed
to edit the damn thing--

125
00:09:26,153 --> 00:09:28,978
Okay, look. Just remember, Lewis,
this is High School.

126
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:32,144
Nothing that happens here
matters in the real world. Got it?

127
00:09:32,229 --> 00:09:34,431
- Yeah.
- Good. I'll see you later.

128
00:09:35,162 --> 00:09:36,638
- Bye.
- Bye.

129
00:09:44,531 --> 00:09:46,264
Yo, tell me if this sucks.

130
00:09:49,414 --> 00:09:51,036
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

131
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:53,646
- Who's harmonizing with you?
- Also me.

132
00:09:53,924 --> 00:09:55,340
I got a new track out.

133
00:10:00,606 --> 00:10:02,954
I want this played at my funeral.

134
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,990
- We're recording EP this summer.
- No way!

135
00:10:06,015 --> 00:10:08,542
Yeah, I'll give the gym a shot
before reality kicks me in the cootch.

136
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,221
Nice. You know I'll come cheer you on.

137
00:10:11,246 --> 00:10:14,295
How else can I justify
my 50% as your manager?

138
00:10:14,603 --> 00:10:15,837
- 50%?
- 50%.

139
00:10:15,911 --> 00:10:18,358
Is there a lawyer in here?
Are you a lawyer? Are you a lawyer?

140
00:10:18,446 --> 00:10:23,106
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am not in the best of moods.

141
00:10:23,663 --> 00:10:24,601
Okay?

142
00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:28,620
I have not had my morning coffee
because the teacher's lounge

143
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:32,218
was filled from floor to ceiling
with balloons.

144
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,827
Ha. Ha. Ha.

145
00:10:33,896 --> 00:10:35,427
Get it out of your system.

146
00:10:35,462 --> 00:10:38,051
All right now, the rest of the time
that we'll spend here together

147
00:10:38,147 --> 00:10:40,046
let's actually try and learn something.

148
00:10:40,093 --> 00:10:41,791
So, should we open up our books at page

149
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,348
- One twenty...
- Freeze, scholar.

150
00:10:44,187 --> 00:10:47,609
Whatever it is just make it quick please.
Thank you.

151
00:10:49,475 --> 00:10:53,377
My maiden, will thou accompany me
to the promenade?

152
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,256
- Yes!
- Huzzah!

153
00:10:57,063 --> 00:10:58,930
Very cute. We all have dates.

154
00:10:58,955 --> 00:11:01,175
Now let's shimmer down
and get back to business.

155
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,778
Okay.

156
00:11:04,117 --> 00:11:06,338
That was pure oxygen.

157
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,629
Makes a loud noise, right?

158
00:11:08,942 --> 00:11:11,245
But no flame, or heat.

159
00:11:13,349 --> 00:11:15,083
This balloon however

160
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:20,202
is filled with 100% hydrogen.

161
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:27,792
And an explosion of that type.

162
00:11:27,849 --> 00:11:31,137
Because all three
combustion requirements were present.

163
00:11:31,436 --> 00:11:32,793
Flame from the match.

164
00:11:33,074 --> 00:11:35,011
Oxygen from the atmosphere.

165
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,308
And fuel from the...

166
00:11:39,456 --> 00:11:40,613
hydrogen.

167
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,990
Zoe, can I have a word with you, please?

168
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:49,280
Thank you, Mrs. C.

169
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:55,405
Okay.

170
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:58,670
Listen, I know
you've been going through a lot.

171
00:11:58,813 --> 00:12:02,401
But maybe getting involved again
could feel good?

172
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:05,459
You want me to explode next time?

173
00:12:06,286 --> 00:12:09,630
I just don't like seeing
a bright young woman

174
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:13,064
who used to love my class
fade into the background.

175
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,929
No, I'm about to graduate
and leave all of this behind.

176
00:12:16,185 --> 00:12:17,956
I've been accepted to Purdue
for the fall--

177
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,877
Yes, I remember.
I wrote a glowing recommendation.

178
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:23,506
Perhaps that was premature?

179
00:12:24,685 --> 00:12:26,018
Perhaps it was.

180
00:12:27,407 --> 00:12:30,811
But like everyone keeps telling me,
Mrs. Crawford,

181
00:12:31,786 --> 00:12:33,490
you can't change the past.

182
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,919
<i>Your attention please.</i>

183
00:12:38,396 --> 00:12:41,316
<i>Band practice will not be held
in the auditorium today</i>

184
00:12:41,454 --> 00:12:44,288
<i>but will instead move to room 112.</i>

185
00:12:44,691 --> 00:12:45,833
<i>Thank you.</i>

186
00:12:58,681 --> 00:13:02,112
<i>Roses are Red. Violets are Blue.
You didn't ask me, so I'm asking you. Prom?</i>

187
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,522
"We believe we can change things
in accordance with our desires.

188
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:22,340
We believe it because otherwise
we'd see no favorable outcome.

189
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:26,085
We don't think of the outcome
which generally comes to pass,

190
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:30,270
that we do not succeed in changing things
in accordance with our desires,

191
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,218
but gradually our desires change.

192
00:13:33,405 --> 00:13:37,302
The situation that we hoped to change
becomes unimportant to us.

193
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:41,459
We've failed to surmount the
obstacle but life took us around it,

194
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:43,382
and led us beyond it,

195
00:13:43,664 --> 00:13:46,057
and if we turn the gaze into the past

196
00:13:46,346 --> 00:13:51,287
we can barely see it,
so imperceptible has it become."

197
00:13:55,245 --> 00:13:57,146
How cool is that?

198
00:13:58,218 --> 00:14:02,775
And when Marcel Proust
finally finished this novel in 1922

199
00:14:03,312 --> 00:14:05,963
he died, the very same day.

200
00:14:07,878 --> 00:14:09,868
Nothing? Okay.

201
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:10,876
OK.

202
00:14:11,687 --> 00:14:12,823
Hello.

203
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:14,096
What time is this?

204
00:14:14,778 --> 00:14:16,189
All right. Cool.

205
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,288
If you could bring me a note, okay?

206
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,436
It's a Countywide Policy,
just bring me a note from the doctor.

207
00:14:22,491 --> 00:14:24,764
Hey, what time does your lunch start?

208
00:14:25,352 --> 00:14:26,999
- Directly  after at lunch.
- Very cool.

209
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,421
- 12:35.
- Very cool. Cool.

210
00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:33,070
- Thanks. Thank you.
- Yeah.

211
00:14:35,245 --> 00:14:36,869
Yes, ma'am, I'm listening.

212
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,226
How is the pizza?

213
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:49,153
Have you ever eaten a dryer sheet?

214
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:51,110
Gross.

215
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,459
Okay.

216
00:15:05,003 --> 00:15:08,749
Okay, so I'm thinking you've been
to your locker and you're taking it wrong.

217
00:15:08,893 --> 00:15:10,003
How should I take it?

218
00:15:10,168 --> 00:15:13,118
Like a goof,
like a light-hearted friend thing.

219
00:15:13,436 --> 00:15:15,778
We'll go and will make fun of people
together.

220
00:15:15,854 --> 00:15:17,573
Is that your dream prom night?

221
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:21,440
You wanna spend
money on a limo and tux

222
00:15:21,465 --> 00:15:24,908
and the wrist flower thingy

223
00:15:24,986 --> 00:15:27,010
just to do what we do every day?

224
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,384
You pay for your own thingy, but...

225
00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:41,991
- Forget it. You're right.
- I just... I can't.

226
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:46,692
Yes. It'd be too soon and
you know, I don't wanna...

227
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:47,493
What?

228
00:15:47,516 --> 00:15:49,820
You know like with your mom
and everything we should just--

229
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:51,728
This isn't about my mom.

230
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:56,012
God, why do you have
to do this right now?

231
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:58,546
You were the only good thing,
Lewis, it's so--

232
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:00,648
You're not being with
everyone else. Alright?

233
00:16:00,672 --> 00:16:02,414
Don't shut up on
me too. I was just...

234
00:16:04,654 --> 00:16:07,434
- You think I'm shut down?
- No.

235
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:12,278
Yes, but it's like it's not your fault.
You're just...

236
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,640
- Jesus! Dammit!
- I'm sorry.

237
00:16:15,324 --> 00:16:17,555
Look, this is all like coming sideways.
Can you just...

238
00:16:17,634 --> 00:16:19,351
I'm just going to the bathroom.

239
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,571
When you come back can we
just hit refresh and pretend I don't

240
00:16:22,735 --> 00:16:24,063
suck.

241
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,115
Hey, did you lose something in here?

242
00:16:58,186 --> 00:16:59,235
Shit.

243
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:02,431
Hey, you got studs on, girlfriend.

244
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,073
Bitch.

245
00:17:15,354 --> 00:17:17,495
That did not look like a win, bro.

246
00:17:17,634 --> 00:17:20,009
Hey, no. Don't sit there.
She's coming right back.

247
00:17:20,065 --> 00:17:22,234
- So I'm friends with your ma?
- Just leave.

248
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:24,994
Hey, I'm Switzerland.
Don't take it out on me.

249
00:17:25,097 --> 00:17:28,601
Look, we're right in the middle of it.
All right? Just go. Go!

250
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,385
Fine.

251
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:33,241
My mom's gonna want
all those fake flowers back.

252
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:35,308
And the ribbon too.

253
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,409
Little rough on him, weren't you?

254
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:12,149
It's a boundary issue.

255
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:13,999
I agree.

256
00:18:14,217 --> 00:18:16,568
You have way too many.

257
00:18:24,013 --> 00:18:25,370
I like Lewis.

258
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:28,319
Don't wanna lead him on,
end up hurting him.

259
00:18:29,489 --> 00:18:32,119
He's just trying to make
a memory with you, sweetie.

260
00:18:36,956 --> 00:18:38,979
I'm so closed to getting out of here.

261
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:42,011
Few more months.

262
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,067
One thing about going places.

263
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,964
You take yourself there too.

264
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:08,251
Will you go to prom with me?

265
00:19:08,393 --> 00:19:09,557
- Yes!
- Yeah?

266
00:19:11,869 --> 00:19:13,025
No way!

267
00:19:13,658 --> 00:19:14,970
Fuck you!

268
00:19:37,361 --> 00:19:38,687
No. Please! Please!

269
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:56,909
Trigger warning.

270
00:19:57,717 --> 00:19:58,651
Hey!

271
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,863
- Fuck you, bastard!
- Oh, slow down, old man.

272
00:20:08,144 --> 00:20:09,384
How's that for a coach?

273
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,156
Son of a...

274
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,013
Great.

275
00:20:22,276 --> 00:20:24,339
- You know what to do, right?
- Don't worry.

276
00:20:38,534 --> 00:20:39,381
What the...

277
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:40,919
Wait. Wait!

278
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,002
Okay. I got you. I got you.

279
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:44,980
I got you.

280
00:20:45,134 --> 00:20:47,075
Oh my God. Amy?

281
00:20:47,688 --> 00:20:48,439
Amy?

282
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:52,178
Help!

283
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,293
Oh my God!

284
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,211
No. No! Oh My God! No. No.

285
00:20:56,282 --> 00:20:57,362
You're gonna be okay.

286
00:20:57,427 --> 00:20:59,200
Look at me. You're gonna be okay.

287
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:02,766
No.

288
00:21:07,963 --> 00:21:09,123
Go fuck yourself!

289
00:21:10,198 --> 00:21:13,072
<i>Fred Giland if you're in the building
call the main office.</i>

290
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:15,781
<i>Fred Giland please call the office.</i>

291
00:21:23,984 --> 00:21:25,327
All right, listen up.

292
00:21:25,396 --> 00:21:26,569
And, uh...

293
00:21:27,193 --> 00:21:29,133
all of you just might survive, okay?

294
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:31,756
We are in charge now, so please

295
00:21:32,502 --> 00:21:36,005
just do as we say quickly
and without questions or else...

296
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:38,340
Well, you know...

297
00:21:46,341 --> 00:21:48,876
Hey, Roy. How you doin'?

298
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:50,525
You know normally you...

299
00:21:50,971 --> 00:21:52,863
You call me a faggot when
I see you in the halls.

300
00:21:52,888 --> 00:21:55,182
That's kinda our thing.

301
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:01,838
Who's the fag now, man?

302
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,381
I was just messing with him. Okay?

303
00:22:08,442 --> 00:22:10,112
- He disrespected you.
- Look at me!

304
00:22:11,824 --> 00:22:13,774
We need to keep our eyes
on the price. Okay?

305
00:22:13,907 --> 00:22:16,265
We don't have time
for small kills please. Okay?

306
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:17,964
Thank you.

307
00:22:21,742 --> 00:22:22,794
What the fuck?

308
00:22:23,054 --> 00:22:24,043
Hey!

309
00:22:24,622 --> 00:22:25,754
Get down on the ground!

310
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:26,878
Okay. Okay.

311
00:22:27,897 --> 00:22:29,854
Anymore friends back there?

312
00:22:30,527 --> 00:22:31,523
Run.

313
00:23:21,597 --> 00:23:24,552
Now if I were you, and thank God I'm not,

314
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,041
I would wanna to pull out my phone.

315
00:23:27,423 --> 00:23:28,500
Guess what?

316
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,695
All out. It's okay. Please.
Pull them out. Anybody.

317
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,179
Donna? Right? Donna?

318
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:37,798
- Dwan.
- Dwan?

319
00:23:38,273 --> 00:23:39,796
Please don't hurt me.

320
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,462
Dwan, do you have a phone?

321
00:23:47,447 --> 00:23:48,467
Okay.

322
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:55,346
It's okay. Relax.
Dwan. Dwan. Relax.

323
00:23:56,096 --> 00:23:57,276
It's okay.

324
00:23:59,066 --> 00:24:01,940
- It's yours, keep it.
- No. I don't want your phone, Dwan.

325
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:04,828
I want you to have your phone.
That's the point. Please.

326
00:24:06,534 --> 00:24:07,741
Thank you.

327
00:24:09,642 --> 00:24:12,999
Now who in this world
would you most like to know

328
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:15,389
that today could be
the day that you die?

329
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,352
Hey, chief. We got another one.

330
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:31,920
Across town.

331
00:24:32,107 --> 00:24:35,814
All right. Let's splendor that truck off
and send it on over.

332
00:24:38,638 --> 00:24:40,027
Mom, it's me.

333
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:42,302
- <i>I thought you're at school.</i>
- I am at school.

334
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,323
<i>We talked about this, Dawn, you know--</i>

335
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,072
No, listen mom,
there's guy with guns everywhere.

336
00:24:55,672 --> 00:24:57,468
He wanted me to call you.

337
00:24:58,386 --> 00:25:00,920
- <i>I'm calling the police.</i>
- I gotta go, mom.

338
00:25:01,343 --> 00:25:04,576
- <i>I love you.</i>
- I love you too.

339
00:25:05,435 --> 00:25:06,738
I love you.

340
00:25:08,434 --> 00:25:11,704
Okay, Dwan, did you mom say
that she was gonna call the police?

341
00:25:13,157 --> 00:25:14,611
Look at me. Look at me.

342
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:17,284
It's okay if she did.

343
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:18,542
Did she?

344
00:25:19,911 --> 00:25:21,060
Yeah?

345
00:25:22,412 --> 00:25:23,796
She's a good mom.

346
00:25:24,377 --> 00:25:27,347
Fantastic, that's one last step
for all of you to worry about.

347
00:25:27,496 --> 00:25:31,129
All right? Now pull out your phone,
call your parents, text your friends.

348
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,187
Call our congresswoman.
I don't care. All right?

349
00:25:33,287 --> 00:25:34,641
Just get them out, please.

350
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,566
Damn it.

351
00:25:59,846 --> 00:26:03,061
<i>- Hi, this is Julie. Have a blessed day.</i>
- Oh my God.

352
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:10,110
If this is the last time
you hear my voice

353
00:26:10,386 --> 00:26:12,135
I want you to know...

354
00:26:13,467 --> 00:26:15,209
that I didn't die sad.

355
00:26:17,139 --> 00:26:18,923
I don't have any regrets.

356
00:26:19,263 --> 00:26:20,356
And...

357
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,317
Thank you for the life
that you gave me, ma.

358
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,823
I love you to the Moon and back.

359
00:26:42,963 --> 00:26:44,073
Okay.

360
00:26:54,088 --> 00:26:55,765
Kill whatever that is, please.

361
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,699
I'm looking for you.

362
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:31,995
I'm seeing this hole now.

363
00:27:44,108 --> 00:27:46,043
Knowing you must be close.

364
00:28:03,672 --> 00:28:06,093
I'm looking for the thing
that made that sound.

365
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:12,531
<i>Brenda, honey?</i>

366
00:28:18,985 --> 00:28:20,921
Needing you to come out now.

367
00:28:26,797 --> 00:28:28,164
Here.

368
00:28:29,282 --> 00:28:30,616
I'm here.

369
00:28:31,906 --> 00:28:33,889
You should be ashamed.

370
00:28:39,353 --> 00:28:41,363
<i>Brenda, honey, what's happening now?</i>

371
00:28:41,894 --> 00:28:43,466
<i>Were those gunshots?</i>

372
00:28:44,297 --> 00:28:45,238
<i>Brenda?</i>

373
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:47,615
Yeah, I killed that thing of yours.

374
00:28:47,862 --> 00:28:49,123
<i>Where's my fucking--</i>

375
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:25,159
All right, kiddos. That's it. That's time.
Put your pencils down.

376
00:29:25,262 --> 00:29:26,485
End the calls, send the texts.

377
00:29:26,585 --> 00:29:29,442
Do what you gotta do but
I need your absolute silence now. Please.

378
00:29:29,487 --> 00:29:33,113
I promise, do you think I'm gonna
hang up on you. But I can't. I can't...

379
00:29:33,258 --> 00:29:35,415
Move, please. Come on. Move.

380
00:29:36,271 --> 00:29:37,445
Jesus.

381
00:29:38,857 --> 00:29:40,339
<i>Bradley? Son?</i>

382
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,812
Hi, this is Tristan,

383
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,283
I'm sending my thoughts and prayers
to you during this difficult time.

384
00:29:52,191 --> 00:29:53,766
Vernon Central High School,
how may I help you?

385
00:29:53,866 --> 00:29:55,896
I'm calling to help you, actually.

386
00:29:56,108 --> 00:29:58,554
Really? I could use some today.

387
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,127
Aren't you cute?

388
00:30:00,317 --> 00:30:03,647
Okay, you have a live shooting situation
in the cafeteria.

389
00:30:07,525 --> 00:30:08,552
This isn't a joke, okay?

390
00:30:08,652 --> 00:30:11,351
There are students with weapons
in a lunch room right now.

391
00:30:11,941 --> 00:30:13,648
And you know this how?

392
00:30:15,979 --> 00:30:19,987
Because you are one of the students
in our cafeteria with a firearm?

393
00:30:20,344 --> 00:30:22,460
Let's get more specific. I'm Tristan Voy.

394
00:30:22,546 --> 00:30:24,096
And you say your name is Tristan Voy?

395
00:30:24,196 --> 00:30:25,045
Keep talking.

396
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:27,682
You with me.

397
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:30,649
What are you hoping to gain
from this, Tristan?

398
00:30:31,085 --> 00:30:32,775
Hope's got nothing to do with it.

399
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:33,975
Thank you.

400
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:36,467
He hung up. I'm calling 911.

401
00:30:49,191 --> 00:30:51,271
When experts look back
on this day they will agree

402
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:54,589
that she should've announced lock down
over the intercom immediately.

403
00:30:55,613 --> 00:31:00,500
However the rule states that she must first
confirm the information.

404
00:31:02,247 --> 00:31:03,734
How do I know this?

405
00:31:04,646 --> 00:31:08,237
Because they publicly vote on this shit
at the school board meetings.

406
00:31:08,564 --> 00:31:09,689
That's how.

407
00:31:09,774 --> 00:31:12,053
Okay? So while we wait
for this ill-advised staff

408
00:31:12,228 --> 00:31:16,033
I want you all to pull out whichever app
you use to do live streaming video:

409
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,174
Instagram, Facebook, Periscope.
It does not matter to me, all right?

410
00:31:19,214 --> 00:31:22,062
Just get them up and running
and point it at me. Now!

411
00:32:11,377 --> 00:32:13,389
Hey! You!

412
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:15,660
- Zoe?
- All of you. Stop!

413
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,356
- Stop! Stop!
- Hey.

414
00:32:18,601 --> 00:32:21,354
Tristan Voy and Chris Jelick
have guns in the cafeteria.

415
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,314
They are killing people.

416
00:32:23,713 --> 00:32:25,316
It's not even funny.

417
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,813
No shit!

418
00:32:27,098 --> 00:32:29,854
Don't go back inside
unless you wanna die, okay?

419
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:34,432
Go!

420
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:36,462
It's better be real.

421
00:32:40,702 --> 00:32:41,597
You are not coming?

422
00:32:41,697 --> 00:32:43,186
No. Most of them still don't know.

423
00:32:45,017 --> 00:32:46,237
Okay?

424
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:48,055
I'm with you.

425
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:49,474
- Okay.
- Yeah?

426
00:32:49,611 --> 00:32:50,904
Yeah. Come on.

427
00:32:52,118 --> 00:32:53,488
My name is Tristan Voy

428
00:32:53,588 --> 00:32:56,819
and you are watching a live take down
of Vernon Central High School.

429
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,670
At first, I would like to give
a quick shutout

430
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,239
to the tech giants
hosting these video streams.

431
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,258
Turn them off, or in any way interrupt them

432
00:33:05,393 --> 00:33:08,220
and we will be forced
to kill everybody immediately.

433
00:33:08,555 --> 00:33:09,887
I promise.

434
00:33:10,752 --> 00:33:13,931
So join me as we dismantle
a bastion of our society

435
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:16,825
in favor of entropy and truth.

436
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,225
Well, well, well. If
it isn't our friendly

437
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,921
old neighborhood security guard.

438
00:33:26,175 --> 00:33:27,845
As if it's not sad
enough that they are

439
00:33:27,869 --> 00:33:29,849
only paying him $12/h
to protect our school.

440
00:33:29,949 --> 00:33:32,114
They expect you to do it
without a fucking gun?

441
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:33,570
Tristan!

442
00:33:33,996 --> 00:33:35,626
Oh, Jesus Christ.

443
00:33:35,706 --> 00:33:37,145
- Yes?
- I'm unarmed.

444
00:33:37,407 --> 00:33:40,448
Sure, except for your
normally cutting remarks, but please.

445
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:41,475
What can I do for you?

446
00:33:41,575 --> 00:33:43,737
Your grievances with me,
not your classmates.

447
00:33:43,837 --> 00:33:46,309
No shit? Do tell. Please.

448
00:33:46,405 --> 00:33:48,994
You were sent to my office
twice last week.

449
00:33:49,072 --> 00:33:49,663
That's right.

450
00:33:49,763 --> 00:33:52,120
And I threatened you.
I threatened you with expulsion.

451
00:33:52,151 --> 00:33:53,420
That's also right.

452
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:56,077
Instead of trying harder
to understand you.

453
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:03,160
You know behind your desk
you have this poster, and it says:

454
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,668
"Making a difference,
once student at a time."

455
00:34:06,664 --> 00:34:08,678
He didn't make time for me.

456
00:34:11,378 --> 00:34:13,188
I let you down, man.

457
00:34:13,473 --> 00:34:15,255
But you got my undivided attention now.

458
00:34:15,307 --> 00:34:18,159
On your desk, there's a picture of you,

459
00:34:18,782 --> 00:34:20,983
and your wife and your two kids.

460
00:34:21,132 --> 00:34:22,319
Where is that?

461
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:26,317
That's at out camp in Broken Bow.

462
00:34:27,016 --> 00:34:29,417
I've never seen a family so happy.

463
00:34:30,085 --> 00:34:31,880
Made me wish
that I could have that someday.

464
00:34:31,917 --> 00:34:34,355
- You absolutely can!
- Wow!

465
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,721
I can have your cabin?

466
00:34:37,853 --> 00:34:39,127
- Sure.
- Okay, great.

467
00:34:39,255 --> 00:34:41,379
- So you heard that, right?
- End this now.

468
00:34:41,638 --> 00:34:44,040
- And we'll make it happen.
- Everybody heard that.

469
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:48,836
Perhaps I can fuck your wife on the beach
while your kids watch too, huh?

470
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:50,712
You see,

471
00:34:50,736 --> 00:34:54,806
last week I wanted to come
to your office twice, man.

472
00:34:55,597 --> 00:34:57,461
During our morning session

473
00:34:57,521 --> 00:35:00,305
I grabbed your keys, I went downtown,
I had a copy made.

474
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:03,491
And during our afternoon session

475
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,537
while you were looking out the window

476
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:07,383
talking about how guys like me
would never amount to anything.

477
00:35:07,408 --> 00:35:10,180
You remember that? I replaced them.

478
00:35:11,596 --> 00:35:13,340
- Tristan.
- Rob.

479
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:17,428
Whatever your reasons are for doing this,
man, we can work it out between us.

480
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:22,493
Maybe we can.

481
00:35:25,429 --> 00:35:26,456
No!

482
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,146
No. Please!

483
00:35:32,179 --> 00:35:34,496
- Get up!
- Please!

484
00:35:38,174 --> 00:35:39,424
Don't bother.

485
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,681
Phase two is about to begin.

486
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:50,763
What did the Texans have?

487
00:35:50,977 --> 00:35:52,366
Grinding determination.

488
00:35:52,487 --> 00:35:54,574
But very little in a way of ammunition.

489
00:35:55,385 --> 00:35:57,483
What we wanna point out is...
A hundred--

490
00:35:58,051 --> 00:35:59,911
- You have to get out now!
- Come on!

491
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,775
Mrs. Greene, Mrs. Greene,
you have to open the window please!

492
00:36:02,822 --> 00:36:04,100
- Please!
- No, no!

493
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,367
Thank you ladies, very clever.

494
00:36:09,653 --> 00:36:10,777
Where was I?

495
00:36:49,104 --> 00:36:51,733
In the corner of your screen
there should be a number,

496
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,255
perhaps next to an eyeball icon.

497
00:36:57,733 --> 00:37:01,040
Who here has more than 50
live viewers right now?

498
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:02,666
Raise your hands please.

499
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:08,019
Okay, great. That's great.
Who has more than 100 live viewers?

500
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:12,130
500?

501
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:15,952
How many do you have?

502
00:37:16,126 --> 00:37:17,942
Just went over a thousand.

503
00:37:19,866 --> 00:37:21,664
Goddamn, get up here.

504
00:37:24,612 --> 00:37:26,444
What makes you so popular?

505
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,665
- I'm not, I'm--
- He does the Yearbook.

506
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:30,466
Ah, the geeky newsboy.

507
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:33,142
Well, actually I'm the admin
of the Vernon High Page.

508
00:37:33,242 --> 00:37:35,305
Look, nobody asked
for your life story, all right?

509
00:37:35,405 --> 00:37:37,666
I don't care where they are coming from,
as long as they are watching.

510
00:37:37,691 --> 00:37:40,036
You are my main camera now,
so please stay close.

511
00:37:40,061 --> 00:37:42,768
And everybody else please put you phone
in a bin as it comes around

512
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:44,691
I have a new task for you.

513
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:49,122
I need to see your work, people.
You can't just Google--

514
00:37:49,271 --> 00:37:50,699
Oh my God!

515
00:37:52,193 --> 00:37:53,962
Ms. Hull! Inappropriate!

516
00:37:54,164 --> 00:37:55,238
What in the name of--

517
00:37:55,338 --> 00:37:58,005
We're under attack. Some students
have guns in the cafeteria.

518
00:37:58,105 --> 00:38:00,894
- This isn't a senior prank.
- Everybody has to get out now.

519
00:38:01,578 --> 00:38:03,310
Josh, lock the door.

520
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:05,449
Okay, come on,
we don't have much time.

521
00:38:05,529 --> 00:38:08,408
Okay, everyone over here now.
Single file line.

522
00:38:08,475 --> 00:38:09,779
- Where do I go?
- Ladies first.

523
00:38:09,879 --> 00:38:12,064
Into the woods.
Stay until the cops come. You're good.

524
00:38:12,365 --> 00:38:13,859
And make sure they're out if you can.

525
00:38:13,887 --> 00:38:14,947
- Single file.
- Good.

526
00:38:15,047 --> 00:38:15,927
Mr. Yates?

527
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:16,890
Yeah.

528
00:38:16,978 --> 00:38:18,560
I got you. One leg at a time.

529
00:38:19,277 --> 00:38:20,825
Oh my Lord.

530
00:38:21,861 --> 00:38:25,054
- They recorded this?
- No, it's live. Happening now.

531
00:38:25,242 --> 00:38:27,922
- How did you find this?
- It's on the school social page.

532
00:38:28,358 --> 00:38:29,555
Lewis.

533
00:38:31,036 --> 00:38:33,074
It's not that hard to build a wall.

534
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,411
Tristan.

535
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:35,658
Coming.

536
00:38:38,437 --> 00:38:40,767
- Are we famous yet?
- Not yet.

537
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,478
Okay.

538
00:38:47,495 --> 00:38:48,415
Yes?

539
00:38:48,581 --> 00:38:50,097
Permission to kill these?

540
00:38:51,585 --> 00:38:52,950
They're useless.

541
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:56,170
Please, you've hurt her enough.

542
00:38:59,655 --> 00:39:02,149
Have you heard of operation T4?

543
00:39:02,461 --> 00:39:04,982
Hitler ordered mercy killings
on the disabled

544
00:39:05,082 --> 00:39:08,858
because he didn't want their deformities
to infect the master race.

545
00:39:10,212 --> 00:39:11,553
Good thing is...

546
00:39:11,744 --> 00:39:12,869
We're not Nazis.

547
00:39:13,473 --> 00:39:14,860
This is gonna take too long.

548
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,555
Should I warn another class?

549
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:18,277
I don't know, I just...

550
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:21,715
You all right? Got this. Okay.

551
00:39:27,384 --> 00:39:28,605
What the hell?

552
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:31,515
Relax. All right? It's early.

553
00:39:31,777 --> 00:39:33,215
But not unexpected.

554
00:39:34,136 --> 00:39:36,458
Anna, can you please
figure this out for me?

555
00:39:36,606 --> 00:39:38,057
- Copy that.
- Keep it moving!

556
00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:39,238
I'm on it.

557
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,815
Leave it all and line up.

558
00:39:42,091 --> 00:39:43,072
Thank you.

559
00:39:45,489 --> 00:39:48,500
Isabelle, leave your purse.
It will still be here when you get back.

560
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,002
What the hell are you doing, Missy?

561
00:40:01,868 --> 00:40:03,757
I think that I have a pass here somewhere.

562
00:40:03,852 --> 00:40:07,277
For the electrical room?
Nobody but me is allowed in it.

563
00:40:14,684 --> 00:40:17,367
What the hell does that mean?
Did they get to it somehow?

564
00:40:17,392 --> 00:40:18,531
I don't know.

565
00:40:19,979 --> 00:40:21,190
What's going on?

566
00:40:22,076 --> 00:40:23,069
Pranking?

567
00:40:23,261 --> 00:40:24,215
Okay.

568
00:40:24,941 --> 00:40:28,700
All right. False alarm everyone.
Back in your classrooms.

569
00:40:28,987 --> 00:40:30,688
You're not getting away that easy.

570
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,351
Come on! You wanna die? Go!

571
00:40:32,451 --> 00:40:34,015
- Come on.
- Okay. Okay.

572
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:35,045
Hey, what are you doing?

573
00:40:35,145 --> 00:40:37,457
Maybe if I can get to the office
I can make an announcement.

574
00:40:37,557 --> 00:40:39,598
Wait, Zoe! I should be
the one to do that.

575
00:40:43,502 --> 00:40:45,611
<i>Sheriff, if someone shooting
at the school--</i>

576
00:40:46,481 --> 00:40:49,125
You're right. If it's an active shooter
we go in immediately.

577
00:40:49,225 --> 00:40:50,997
<i>This fucker holds the kids at gunpoint.</i>

578
00:40:51,097 --> 00:40:52,648
Wait, Tom, if you telling me these kids

579
00:40:52,748 --> 00:40:55,146
are calling their parents
from inside the school

580
00:40:55,176 --> 00:40:57,178
and saying that they are being held by--

581
00:40:57,272 --> 00:40:59,893
I know you're not afraid to go in.
I wanna go in.

582
00:41:00,011 --> 00:41:01,369
But... it's just...

583
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:03,679
Look, let me finish!

584
00:41:03,779 --> 00:41:06,960
If this is more of a hostage situation
than an active shooter

585
00:41:06,995 --> 00:41:08,549
then we contain, negotiate,

586
00:41:08,589 --> 00:41:11,028
and wait for the lead
team before all else fails.

587
00:41:16,278 --> 00:41:19,287
Final projects are due in a few days.

588
00:41:21,455 --> 00:41:23,960
Really impressed
with the work I've been seeing.

589
00:41:24,063 --> 00:41:25,087
Oh, Goodness.

590
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:27,411
Hopefully you guys have saved your work.

591
00:41:32,888 --> 00:41:34,191
Get outside!

592
00:41:34,552 --> 00:41:37,018
Get outside! There's school shooting.
Let's go!

593
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,225
- Fuck!
- Oh, shit. Let's go!

594
00:41:40,826 --> 00:41:42,031
Fuck!

595
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,830
Fuck you, Becky!

596
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:06,519
<i>Sheriff, I'm a mile away,
you can't tell me not to go in.</i>

597
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:07,587
Listen to me, Tommy.

598
00:42:07,687 --> 00:42:10,477
If it sounds like I'm pulling rank on you
it's because I am.

599
00:42:10,526 --> 00:42:13,038
Now Vernon is your town
but it's my county, okay?

600
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:15,138
<i>You're not the whose
with family in there.</i>

601
00:42:15,636 --> 00:42:18,599
Yes. I hear you, Tommy.
I know your nephew's in there.

602
00:42:18,645 --> 00:42:22,841
But you if you have fast an entry team
you gonna get everybody killed.

603
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:26,157
Now I'm two minutes away. Just,
hold out for just a goddamn minute.

604
00:42:26,257 --> 00:42:28,761
We could...Tom? Tommy?

605
00:42:29,507 --> 00:42:30,855
Son of a bitch!

606
00:42:31,105 --> 00:42:32,173
He hung up?

607
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,410
He's hellbent on going in immediately.

608
00:42:34,644 --> 00:42:36,977
Here. Get us
the hell outta here, will you?

609
00:42:37,535 --> 00:42:38,725
Let's go. Go.

610
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:42,219
- Surely they all follow it.
- Yes, we see them.

611
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,730
Okay, they're gonna keep their lights
and sirens off until we know if it's real.

612
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,470
- It's real.
- Okay.

613
00:42:47,976 --> 00:42:51,079
We have confirmation. There are
active shooters in the building.

614
00:42:51,243 --> 00:42:52,770
They killed Rob.

615
00:42:53,977 --> 00:42:56,369
Yes. I'm here. I just... I need to...

616
00:42:56,411 --> 00:42:58,972
make a lock down announcement
as quickly as possible?

617
00:42:59,603 --> 00:43:01,819
Yes, we'll keep the line open.
Take this.

618
00:43:02,354 --> 00:43:03,356
Okay.

619
00:43:05,202 --> 00:43:06,765
Attention, faculty and students.

620
00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:09,503
We are in lock down.
I repeat we are in lock down.

621
00:43:09,749 --> 00:43:12,857
Please just follow your school
safety manuals for instructions

622
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:16,024
as we put it in the lock down
until further notice. Thank you.

623
00:43:18,871 --> 00:43:21,727
Officer, is there anything else
we should be doing right now?

624
00:43:25,206 --> 00:43:26,692
Hey, you need to slow down!

625
00:43:27,147 --> 00:43:29,903
I'm not the problem, okay?
They are at the cafeteria.

626
00:43:30,002 --> 00:43:31,082
We know that!

627
00:43:31,152 --> 00:43:33,345
Get back to your home room
and stay put until--

628
00:43:36,133 --> 00:43:37,346
Oh, shit.

629
00:43:38,066 --> 00:43:39,518
Fuck. Guys, everyone all right?

630
00:43:39,606 --> 00:43:41,219
- Yes.
- All right. Okay. Hold on.

631
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:45,164
Okay. Lock down means we stay put,
lock the door.

632
00:43:45,259 --> 00:43:46,959
Emma, can you lock the door please?

633
00:43:46,988 --> 00:43:48,181
Close the window blinds.

634
00:43:48,285 --> 00:43:51,178
Get against the wall that isn't in view.
Everyone go to that wall.

635
00:43:51,278 --> 00:43:52,075
And keep quiet.

636
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:54,604
That's it. Come on in.
Keep coming. File in.

637
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:59,856
Hey, we're okay. It's all right.

638
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:03,213
If the office announces the lock down

639
00:44:03,522 --> 00:44:05,431
then they're on it.
Police have been notified.

640
00:44:05,623 --> 00:44:09,043
This is Tarsy. I need all available units
to Vernon Central High...

641
00:44:09,076 --> 00:44:11,751
- Sir! Sir!
- Good Christ!

642
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:14,330
Tommy!

643
00:44:19,963 --> 00:44:22,413
- Tom, you read me?
- There are officers down, we need medics.

644
00:44:22,643 --> 00:44:26,371
Police are here. Some lady cop's
calling for an ambulance.

645
00:44:26,661 --> 00:44:27,755
Nice!

646
00:44:28,303 --> 00:44:31,144
Yes! The phase three begins. And?

647
00:44:31,165 --> 00:44:33,338
We just got teased on the Channel 2 News.

648
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:35,193
Are they airing our stream yet?

649
00:44:35,629 --> 00:44:36,680
No.

650
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,493
The anchor said
they plan to go live from out-front.

651
00:44:41,827 --> 00:44:43,798
Hello, this is live from inside.

652
00:44:43,831 --> 00:44:46,045
Nobody wants to see
your bullshit reporter.

653
00:44:46,097 --> 00:44:47,904
They want to see me.

654
00:44:49,223 --> 00:44:51,934
<i>I'm finished in the basement.
Awaiting for the orders.</i>

655
00:44:53,272 --> 00:44:53,937
Great work.

656
00:44:54,112 --> 00:44:57,298
Do some reckon on the office
on your way back. I wanna see how we did.

657
00:45:02,165 --> 00:45:06,237
<i>Let the sheriff know we've got
the remnants of the home-made bomb here.</i>

658
00:45:06,984 --> 00:45:09,811
If somebody wanted to keep us busy
and clogged the roads.

659
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,706
Understood. I'll let him know.

660
00:45:14,938 --> 00:45:16,860
Williams, have you set the perimeter?

661
00:45:16,892 --> 00:45:19,462
Nobody does shit around here
without my say so!

662
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:22,476
What the hell is going on in here?

663
00:45:22,576 --> 00:45:25,286
Sheriff! Sheriff!
You have to see this.

664
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,828
All right. Come on everybody! Let's go!
Away from the school!

665
00:45:36,328 --> 00:45:38,436
Hey! Hey!

666
00:45:44,422 --> 00:45:46,311
Okay, we need to get out of here.

667
00:45:50,821 --> 00:45:53,114
Not as painful as it looks.

668
00:45:54,095 --> 00:45:55,412
In fact...

669
00:45:57,828 --> 00:45:59,699
When it happens fast

670
00:45:59,998 --> 00:46:02,091
there's often no pain at all.

671
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,805
Suddenly you're the expert on death?

672
00:46:05,862 --> 00:46:07,611
You only did it once.

673
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:10,553
Yes. I'm a quick study.

674
00:46:10,944 --> 00:46:12,790
You got that from me.

675
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:14,541
Yeah.

676
00:46:14,641 --> 00:46:18,020
Going through people's pockets,
that you got from your dad.

677
00:46:18,384 --> 00:46:19,788
I need a phone.

678
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:24,433
Always have known exactly
what you wanted.

679
00:46:24,822 --> 00:46:26,477
Even as a baby.

680
00:46:27,498 --> 00:46:29,094
You wanna talk pain?

681
00:46:29,421 --> 00:46:31,283
- Breastfeeding you was a--
- Mom.

682
00:46:31,383 --> 00:46:33,415
No, it was a nightmare.

683
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:35,591
But I admire it.

684
00:46:38,034 --> 00:46:39,696
Do I close his eyes?

685
00:46:39,849 --> 00:46:42,277
Well, he's not here anymore, sweetie.

686
00:46:44,133 --> 00:46:46,676
He's free of all attachments now.

687
00:46:48,525 --> 00:46:49,747
Is that how you feel?

688
00:46:49,928 --> 00:46:51,269
Almost.

689
00:46:51,988 --> 00:46:54,651
I still got one person who's holding on.

690
00:46:55,692 --> 00:46:59,553
Someone who's not quite ready
to release me just yet.

691
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:06,967
Definitely success.

692
00:47:10,268 --> 00:47:12,167
Maybe even better than expected.

693
00:47:15,293 --> 00:47:17,724
<i>Pictures are worth
a thousands words, my darling.</i>

694
00:47:17,848 --> 00:47:19,833
<i>And video, even more.</i>

695
00:47:31,864 --> 00:47:34,059
This is for stealing all my weed.

696
00:47:48,776 --> 00:47:51,064
<i>Begin sweeping the rooms. Top down.</i>

697
00:47:52,326 --> 00:47:54,982
10-4. And standby for the pics.

698
00:48:07,687 --> 00:48:08,805
Sit!

699
00:48:19,826 --> 00:48:20,912
Miss?

700
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,571
Do you believe in God?

701
00:48:23,752 --> 00:48:24,957
Yes.

702
00:48:25,604 --> 00:48:26,791
Huh?

703
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:31,904
Now why would God
let something like this happen to you?

704
00:48:36,061 --> 00:48:37,507
Oh, Anna.

705
00:48:40,563 --> 00:48:42,408
Is it just me or it's hot in here?

706
00:48:42,416 --> 00:48:44,653
<i>This is for stealing all my weed.</i>

707
00:49:01,327 --> 00:49:02,360
Nice.

708
00:49:02,385 --> 00:49:04,385
Free will.

709
00:49:06,857 --> 00:49:09,762
God allows the wicked
to do their wickedness.

710
00:49:10,774 --> 00:49:12,240
Oh yeah? Why is that?

711
00:49:13,452 --> 00:49:15,189
So they can be judged.

712
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:21,244
Channel 5 just interrupted
their programming.

713
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,255
They're warning viewers
about graphic content

714
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:28,955
because they are about to air
the live stream.

715
00:49:31,209 --> 00:49:32,524
Hot dog.

716
00:49:35,112 --> 00:49:36,983
You got the con. Okay?

717
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:39,835
We need more bodies
so we'll be right back.

718
00:49:39,929 --> 00:49:41,702
You two are coming with me.

719
00:49:41,852 --> 00:49:43,016
Let's move.

720
00:49:48,288 --> 00:49:51,150
Hey! If anyone is in there
you need to get out of there. Okay?

721
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,759
They gonna come looking for you.

722
00:49:52,869 --> 00:49:55,119
Just break the window. Get out if you can.

723
00:49:55,156 --> 00:49:55,916
Fuck.

724
00:49:56,115 --> 00:49:59,285
Hey! If anyone is in there
you shouldn't hide in the rooms.

725
00:49:59,393 --> 00:50:00,354
They gonna come looking for you.

726
00:50:00,379 --> 00:50:02,849
- Are you a staff member?
- No. Hey, look.

727
00:50:04,013 --> 00:50:05,883
They are in the cafeteria now.

728
00:50:05,987 --> 00:50:09,009
But I think they wanted a lock down.

729
00:50:09,852 --> 00:50:12,284
And it makes it easier
to round everybody up that way.

730
00:50:12,338 --> 00:50:14,701
Break the window. Get out if you can.

731
00:50:14,733 --> 00:50:17,780
We're not supposed to leave
until the office announces that it's over.

732
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,145
No, you don't understand.
There is no office anymore.

733
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:27,827
Fuck! Fuck!

734
00:50:38,829 --> 00:50:39,847
Run.

735
00:50:53,841 --> 00:50:55,045
Hola!

736
00:50:56,477 --> 00:50:57,612
Don't worry amigos.

737
00:50:57,665 --> 00:51:00,420
For those of you just joining us
this is school shooting.

738
00:51:00,542 --> 00:51:01,648
Tristan?

739
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,044
Ms. Nunez, how are you?

740
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,766
I'm gonna need to take
everybody down to the cafeteria.

741
00:51:07,461 --> 00:51:09,930
<i>La cafeteria.</i> Is that right?

742
00:51:10,843 --> 00:51:13,183
Please don't hurt anyone.

743
00:51:17,498 --> 00:51:19,207
You know it's the
one thing I've always

744
00:51:19,231 --> 00:51:20,544
really liked about you,
Ms. Nunez, you really

745
00:51:20,586 --> 00:51:23,498
genuinely care about your students.

746
00:51:24,602 --> 00:51:26,114
Another thing I like is...

747
00:51:26,389 --> 00:51:28,953
You know you have this way
of turning to write on the board

748
00:51:29,053 --> 00:51:31,627
it really holds the young man's attention.

749
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,035
Tristan, please don't...

750
00:51:33,127 --> 00:51:34,556
Hey, <i>por favor</i>!

751
00:51:35,073 --> 00:51:38,045
Ms. Nunez,
this is a Spanish-speaking classroom.

752
00:51:42,056 --> 00:51:43,486
You are beautiful.

753
00:51:45,013 --> 00:51:47,210
And you know what, for you...

754
00:51:48,273 --> 00:51:50,961
I think I can promise
that I won't hurt anybody

755
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,709
if you can do something for me.

756
00:51:55,607 --> 00:51:58,400
<i>Quםtate la blusa.</i>

757
00:52:26,954 --> 00:52:29,391
Oh my God! Let go!

758
00:52:45,928 --> 00:52:46,866
Let go!

759
00:52:47,198 --> 00:52:48,161
Fuck

760
00:52:48,403 --> 00:52:49,579
you!

761
00:53:03,043 --> 00:53:04,368
Ms. Nunez.

762
00:53:05,489 --> 00:53:06,894
It's okay, Kitty.

763
00:53:15,507 --> 00:53:17,603
What, do you think I'm a child?
Everything.

764
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:24,488
Wow.

765
00:53:28,057 --> 00:53:30,957
You know you really are
the nicest teacher--

766
00:53:31,088 --> 00:53:31,983
Tristan.

767
00:53:32,284 --> 00:53:34,660
I have a few questions for you.

768
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,962
I turned on the live comments feature
and it's blowing up.

769
00:53:38,027 --> 00:53:39,389
People are really interested in--

770
00:53:39,442 --> 00:53:41,640
Did I tell you to do that?

771
00:53:42,436 --> 00:53:44,075
- No, I'm sorry.
- No.

772
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,972
I'll turn it off.

773
00:53:54,077 --> 00:53:55,879
What kind of questions are they asking?

774
00:54:22,026 --> 00:54:23,987
Don't wanna get your hands dirty, huh?

775
00:54:42,276 --> 00:54:43,620
Miss Voy!

776
00:54:48,371 --> 00:54:49,933
Hello!

777
00:54:54,762 --> 00:54:56,692
Hey, is that you
calling in on the land line?

778
00:54:56,717 --> 00:54:58,433
Yeah. Is there a car on the drive?

779
00:54:58,437 --> 00:55:01,138
It's not. There is a TV on,
but they believe ma is off the town.

780
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:03,481
SWAT team's still 30 away.
They were on their way up to North

781
00:55:03,581 --> 00:55:06,267
responding to the bullshit bomb threats
somebody called in.

782
00:55:06,745 --> 00:55:08,589
These jackass look
three steps ahead of us.

783
00:55:08,614 --> 00:55:10,698
Look around and see
if there is a back door.

784
00:55:11,121 --> 00:55:12,325
Roger that.

785
00:55:12,871 --> 00:55:13,911
Miss Voy!

786
00:55:14,309 --> 00:55:16,816
He's shooting up a school
live on the internet,

787
00:55:16,841 --> 00:55:19,402
but giving me his number
will violet his privacy?

788
00:55:19,543 --> 00:55:20,723
What?

789
00:55:21,292 --> 00:55:22,254
Second floor plans.

790
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,856
Hey, do we even got a warrant for this?

791
00:55:25,956 --> 00:55:26,960
No. No time.

792
00:55:27,164 --> 00:55:30,686
That's why I'm calling
what you're now doing a wellness check.

793
00:55:30,856 --> 00:55:32,270
Roger that.

794
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:34,003
Miss Voy!

795
00:55:44,053 --> 00:55:45,021
Okay.

796
00:55:56,046 --> 00:55:58,934
<i>How long
did it take for you to plan?</i>

797
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,134
<i>Fourteen months or so, I really...</i>

798
00:56:03,812 --> 00:56:05,073
<i>To make it sane.</i>

799
00:56:05,441 --> 00:56:07,978
<i>Between researching the blueprints
of the building,</i>

800
00:56:08,078 --> 00:56:10,455
<i>gathering the tech, weaponry etc.</i>

801
00:56:15,182 --> 00:56:17,598
How did you get the idea to do this?

802
00:56:18,487 --> 00:56:21,157
I didn't get the idea.

803
00:56:22,354 --> 00:56:24,292
So much, as the idea got me.

804
00:56:24,432 --> 00:56:26,588
You know, it reached out
and grabbed me by the neck.

805
00:56:26,613 --> 00:56:28,971
And it hasn't let go. Quite frankly.

806
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:34,988
Miss Voy!

807
00:56:49,207 --> 00:56:52,496
<i>...we are also waiting
for a SWAT team just now en route...</i>

808
00:56:55,982 --> 00:56:57,599
It's officer Banks.

809
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,372
I got eyes on Miss Voy.

810
00:57:02,326 --> 00:57:04,552
She ain't gonna be helping you
talk to her son.

811
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:14,037
<i>Breaking in here folks
with some very disturbing news</i>

812
00:57:14,062 --> 00:57:16,271
<i>out of Vernon Central High School.</i>

813
00:57:16,296 --> 00:57:21,679
<i>There are multiple confirmed reports
of an active shooting situation.</i>

814
00:57:21,956 --> 00:57:25,089
<i>We know that hostages are being held...<i>

815
00:57:25,243 --> 00:57:26,569
Come here! Listen up!

816
00:57:26,594 --> 00:57:31,751
Anybody inside my perimeter
from now on must gear up, okay?

817
00:57:32,397 --> 00:57:34,452
We've already lost
two good officers.

818
00:57:34,477 --> 00:57:37,304
So tactical vest and helmets,
right now. Let's go.

819
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,514
No, he left me in charge.

820
00:57:41,687 --> 00:57:43,241
Not you.

821
00:57:44,746 --> 00:57:46,551
No. This is my body.

822
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:48,145
No.

823
00:57:48,488 --> 00:57:51,518
<i>From what I can tell, it looks like
they are getting ready to enter the school.</i>

824
00:57:51,618 --> 00:57:54,791
<i>They are armoring up, not quite sure,
but from what it looks like</i>

825
00:57:54,829 --> 00:57:56,789
<i>they are preparing to enter the school.</i>

826
00:57:56,904 --> 00:57:58,289
<i>Trunks are being opened.</i>

827
00:57:58,352 --> 00:58:01,153
<i>They are loading their weapons
and vests are being deployed.</i>

828
00:58:01,516 --> 00:58:03,828
<i>A full scale seize approach is risky</i>

829
00:58:03,853 --> 00:58:05,703
<i>but it could make sense from the...</i>

830
00:58:18,253 --> 00:58:20,402
Any reason for committing
such a violent--

831
00:58:20,502 --> 00:58:21,425
Shut up.

832
00:58:25,406 --> 00:58:28,656
Okay. You're okay.
Your vest caught it. You're okay!

833
00:58:28,961 --> 00:58:30,484
Let's go, Bill. Come on.

834
00:58:33,893 --> 00:58:35,112
Back!

835
00:58:35,299 --> 00:58:36,799
Chris.

836
00:58:37,088 --> 00:58:38,815
Christopher, answer me.

837
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:39,924
Tristan?

838
00:58:40,182 --> 00:58:41,596
Who the fuck else would it be?

839
00:58:41,634 --> 00:58:43,835
They tried to escape.
I didn't kill without permission.

840
00:58:43,935 --> 00:58:45,537
Okay. Relax. Relax.

841
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:48,286
I'm hearing the chors again...

842
00:58:48,572 --> 00:58:50,110
They found me here somehow.

843
00:58:50,878 --> 00:58:52,894
You know they aren't real. Right, buddy?

844
00:58:57,195 --> 00:58:58,451
Hold on. I'm coming down

845
00:58:58,475 --> 00:59:00,841
because apparently
I have to do everything myself.

846
00:59:00,883 --> 00:59:02,323
Give me your extra piece.

847
00:59:09,661 --> 00:59:10,708
Well.

848
00:59:13,451 --> 00:59:16,341
It's funny when you are holding a hammer,
everything looks like a nail.

849
00:59:16,662 --> 00:59:19,756
Everybody to the cafeteria.
Now! Two by two, please.

850
00:59:19,851 --> 00:59:21,193
And we are behind.

851
00:59:21,293 --> 00:59:23,472
So I'm gonna take this group down,
you go collect more.

852
00:59:23,498 --> 00:59:26,841
We're the number 1 trending topic online.

853
00:59:27,372 --> 00:59:28,645
About damn time.

854
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:32,856
Well, get to it!
What are you guys doing? Let's move!

855
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:38,760
To the cafeteria, now!

856
00:59:42,323 --> 00:59:45,580
Keep the camera pointed at them.
Please. Keep it moving.

857
00:59:45,752 --> 00:59:48,330
One foot after the other.
Keep it moving.

858
01:00:12,117 --> 01:00:14,398
Find some floor. Make yourself at home.

859
01:00:14,423 --> 01:00:16,312
- I'm sorry.
- I know. I know.

860
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,378
- They always try to take over.
- I know.

861
01:00:20,233 --> 01:00:21,561
They are gone now, right?

862
01:00:22,772 --> 01:00:23,834
Yes?

863
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:25,599
Because you're here.

864
01:00:25,812 --> 01:00:27,146
I'm here.

865
01:00:28,116 --> 01:00:30,588
No. Not right now, okay?
There is still a lot to get done.

866
01:00:30,688 --> 01:00:31,819
You don't love me anymore?

867
01:00:32,065 --> 01:00:35,904
- You've moved on my sister.
- I love you and Anna both equally. Okay?

868
01:00:35,959 --> 01:00:37,559
Now fucking medicate man.

869
01:00:37,659 --> 01:00:40,238
Get yourself together,
there's still a lot to get done.

870
01:00:44,454 --> 01:00:45,971
Get in. Come on.

871
01:00:49,701 --> 01:00:51,217
Anna. Where are you?

872
01:01:00,408 --> 01:01:02,851
Hey, would you please report back?
Tell me where you are.

873
01:01:14,382 --> 01:01:16,022
I did that, you bitch!

874
01:01:31,467 --> 01:01:34,009
Anna, what the fuck? Speak.

875
01:02:01,874 --> 01:02:03,842
Knock 'em dead, sweetie.

876
01:02:06,585 --> 01:02:07,538
It's...

877
01:02:07,852 --> 01:02:09,547
It's funny cause it's...

878
01:02:11,188 --> 01:02:12,695
it's a theater.

879
01:02:15,671 --> 01:02:16,773
Your hair.

880
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:18,687
Yeah.

881
01:02:19,109 --> 01:02:20,359
Do you like it?

882
01:02:23,507 --> 01:02:26,734
So, you obviously met me when you said
someone was holding you back.

883
01:02:28,046 --> 01:02:29,218
But you're wrong.

884
01:02:30,539 --> 01:02:33,148
You died, there is nothing
I can do to change that.

885
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:35,263
Well.

886
01:02:35,895 --> 01:02:37,747
You said yourself.

887
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:39,927
I only died once.

888
01:02:40,231 --> 01:02:41,216
Right?

889
01:02:41,575 --> 01:02:42,552
Right.

890
01:02:42,966 --> 01:02:46,606
But how many times
did I die in your mind since then?

891
01:02:47,185 --> 01:02:50,224
How often do you think
of that day?

892
01:02:51,419 --> 01:02:53,763
But you don't really see me
anymore, sweetie.

893
01:02:54,411 --> 01:02:56,349
You just see the monster that got me.

894
01:02:56,374 --> 01:02:57,606
I can't help it.

895
01:02:58,763 --> 01:03:00,395
Well, you can.

896
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:03,497
Look at me now.

897
01:03:05,981 --> 01:03:08,810
That deep place inside of you.

898
01:03:09,247 --> 01:03:12,835
Your will to live is getting stronger.

899
01:03:14,145 --> 01:03:16,614
And it's letting me live again too.

900
01:03:18,497 --> 01:03:20,935
- The way I really want.
- Jesus!

901
01:03:22,745 --> 01:03:25,096
You hear voices too?

902
01:03:25,947 --> 01:03:27,143
Maybe.

903
01:03:28,706 --> 01:03:30,464
What's your excuse?

904
01:03:33,596 --> 01:03:34,917
Really?

905
01:03:35,885 --> 01:03:37,104
God!

906
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:41,638
You agreed to be a part of this
and it doesn't even mean anything to you?

907
01:03:44,164 --> 01:03:45,861
It's even more disgusting.

908
01:03:50,846 --> 01:03:55,063
Tristan called it a reckoning.

909
01:03:55,162 --> 01:03:56,617
A reckoning?

910
01:03:57,786 --> 01:03:59,481
For what? You're a kid!

911
01:03:59,506 --> 01:04:01,137
I'm eighteen.

912
01:04:03,014 --> 01:04:04,826
You're pathetic, is what you are.

913
01:04:08,491 --> 01:04:10,043
What did you know about me?

914
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,261
Before all this?

915
01:04:14,577 --> 01:04:15,741
Nothing.

916
01:04:16,788 --> 01:04:18,538
You are incredibly forgettable.

917
01:04:19,991 --> 01:04:21,437
Come on.

918
01:04:22,655 --> 01:04:23,529
Come on!

919
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:25,752
God, what are you fishing for, Kip?

920
01:04:25,815 --> 01:04:27,001
Sixth grade.

921
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:31,420
Chloe Paul and AJ Turner

922
01:04:31,963 --> 01:04:36,658
sneak up and pulled my pants down
in front of assembly.

923
01:04:37,947 --> 01:04:39,216
But they also got my underwear.

924
01:04:39,316 --> 01:04:41,351
- That's what this is about?
- Don't.

925
01:04:41,442 --> 01:04:44,916
Oh, sorry. Have I belittled your motivation
for cold blooded murder?

926
01:04:45,016 --> 01:04:46,870
You just want me to say
what you already know.

927
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:49,547
Kip, I personally hope you rot in here.

928
01:04:54,304 --> 01:04:56,147
But a cop will probably find you.

929
01:04:57,886 --> 01:04:59,112
Eventually.

930
01:05:00,136 --> 01:05:02,378
Everyone laughed at me, naked!

931
01:05:02,792 --> 01:05:05,932
And it started years of people
giggling near me.

932
01:05:06,262 --> 01:05:07,380
Behind me.

933
01:05:08,342 --> 01:05:10,264
So many veil jokes.

934
01:05:10,545 --> 01:05:12,388
Even from teachers.

935
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:15,362
About my coming up short on homework.

936
01:05:20,104 --> 01:05:21,385
Do you ever think

937
01:05:22,229 --> 01:05:24,674
that the people you heard giggling

938
01:05:25,416 --> 01:05:27,166
were happy?

939
01:05:29,573 --> 01:05:35,131
And maybe teachers with no idea
which words were triggering you

940
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,501
just didn't wanna see you flunk?

941
01:05:39,753 --> 01:05:40,956
Not only...

942
01:05:42,706 --> 01:05:46,443
does this punishment not fit any crime,

943
01:05:50,042 --> 01:05:51,519
but Kip,

944
01:05:53,315 --> 01:05:55,878
most of these people
are completely innocent.

945
01:06:00,362 --> 01:06:02,620
This girl, Amy Kim,

946
01:06:07,718 --> 01:06:10,578
died in my arms
on the bathroom floor today.

947
01:06:13,868 --> 01:06:17,580
And all I know about her
is that she liked horses.

948
01:06:23,975 --> 01:06:27,199
On these little ribbons for jumping them.

949
01:06:41,262 --> 01:06:43,887
How did she deserve to go like that?

950
01:07:00,044 --> 01:07:01,363
I'm a numbers guy.

951
01:07:02,021 --> 01:07:03,622
Sure. I would like to...

952
01:07:03,818 --> 01:07:06,266
look at my name on the scoreboard
just like anyone.

953
01:07:06,601 --> 01:07:09,624
But never ever let it be said

954
01:07:10,257 --> 01:07:12,523
that playing video games
leads to real life violence.

955
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:14,006
It doesn't.

956
01:07:14,382 --> 01:07:15,999
Sudoku though... I mean...

957
01:07:17,007 --> 01:07:19,111
Come on, that is scary shit.

958
01:07:19,421 --> 01:07:21,741
<i>Anyway, when you plan
your very own mass shooting</i>

959
01:07:22,286 --> 01:07:25,598
<i>don't just go for the ** one of these
like they all do.</i>

960
01:07:26,022 --> 01:07:28,046
<i>They don't have a set number
in mind, they just...</i>

961
01:07:28,084 --> 01:07:29,444
- <i>They wanna be bigger...</i>
- Todd.

962
01:07:29,469 --> 01:07:31,260
<i>and they wanna be better,
so they just go in...</i>

963
01:07:31,337 --> 01:07:32,783
Lauren, Lauren Cope.

964
01:07:32,839 --> 01:07:34,991
I used to cut your
wife's hair before.

965
01:07:35,002 --> 01:07:36,683
Oh yeah, yeah, right.

966
01:07:37,182 --> 01:07:38,080
Thanks.

967
01:07:38,361 --> 01:07:40,617
I don't even know what the hell
are we looking at in here.

968
01:07:40,717 --> 01:07:43,644
It's a live stream from inside the school.
It's happening right now.

969
01:07:44,517 --> 01:07:47,008
<i>I mean how can you hit a target
if you are not aiming?</i>

970
01:07:47,501 --> 01:07:50,071
<i>Me, I've got a number.
The number that I specially like.</i>

971
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,149
<i>And I figure out how to get it.</i>

972
01:08:17,605 --> 01:08:19,073
- Please Zoe.
- No.

973
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:21,652
No. I'm sorry.
I'm not one of them.

974
01:08:21,677 --> 01:08:22,754
Okay?

975
01:08:23,042 --> 01:08:23,894
Okay.

976
01:08:23,919 --> 01:08:25,723
You guys, you need to get out of here
right now.

977
01:08:25,748 --> 01:08:28,536
We're trying to.
Claire says they are in the cafeteria.

978
01:08:29,053 --> 01:08:30,685
<i>Chaz Harting getting...</i>

979
01:08:32,217 --> 01:08:33,178
Okay. Good.

980
01:08:33,217 --> 01:08:34,678
Good. Come on.

981
01:08:35,904 --> 01:08:37,974
<i>...indecisive, helpless...</i>

982
01:08:39,975 --> 01:08:41,380
Hello.

983
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:43,560
Holy shit! Girl.

984
01:08:44,295 --> 01:08:45,998
Yeah, yeah. I'll find him.

985
01:08:46,443 --> 01:08:48,021
Give me one second.

986
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:50,731
Sheriff. Sheriff. Hey.

987
01:08:50,831 --> 01:08:53,087
Do you remember that friend that
I was telling you about.

988
01:08:53,187 --> 01:08:54,781
The one that saved all of our asses?

989
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:56,358
She's calling from inside.

990
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:58,139
Toss it. Let's go.

991
01:08:59,264 --> 01:09:00,280
Hello.

992
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:01,553
Hello to you too.

993
01:09:01,965 --> 01:09:03,324
Look, Sheriff.

994
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:05,918
An entire class
will come out right now.

995
01:09:06,332 --> 01:09:08,753
But the shooters are watching
our every move on the news.

996
01:09:08,793 --> 01:09:10,815
Okay. Hang in there.
Let me see what I can do.

997
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:11,660
Okay.

998
01:09:12,863 --> 01:09:15,425
As students inside are preparing
for their greatest test yet

999
01:09:15,722 --> 01:09:17,894
one more failure
could cost them their lives.

1000
01:09:17,919 --> 01:09:19,942
Hey, don't put the school
in the shot for a few minutes.

1001
01:09:19,967 --> 01:09:22,012
- We have every right to do...
- No. I know you do,

1002
01:09:22,037 --> 01:09:24,622
but that nutcase is
watching your broadcast.

1003
01:09:24,653 --> 01:09:27,575
All right? So I know I can't make you
so I am asking.

1004
01:09:27,698 --> 01:09:29,390
Talk to the parents,
interview the kids,

1005
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:31,968
anything but keep
the school out of the shot, okay?

1006
01:09:32,026 --> 01:09:33,179
I'm happy to not show the school.

1007
01:09:33,204 --> 01:09:34,546
Well, good! I appreciate that.

1008
01:09:34,571 --> 01:09:36,219
If you give me something
better to point our camera at.

1009
01:09:36,244 --> 01:09:37,423
We got it.

1010
01:09:39,954 --> 01:09:42,868
How about a shot of me
personally calling that asshole?

1011
01:09:42,893 --> 01:09:44,298
Great. On speakerphone.

1012
01:09:49,213 --> 01:09:50,526
Fast! Fast!

1013
01:09:57,096 --> 01:09:59,451
I will take a large wine pizza.

1014
01:09:59,578 --> 01:10:00,765
Easy on the cheese please

1015
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,957
as I am dairy sensitive.

1016
01:10:03,969 --> 01:10:06,705
Is that what this is all about, Tristan,
a lunch order?

1017
01:10:06,747 --> 01:10:08,230
What I'm saying, Sheriff is that

1018
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:10,964
there is nothing
you can do for me

1019
01:10:11,334 --> 01:10:13,597
except watch me beat the game.

1020
01:10:14,236 --> 01:10:16,814
The game is easy to win
if you are the only one playing.

1021
01:10:18,158 --> 01:10:19,767
Nothing about this

1022
01:10:20,064 --> 01:10:21,557
was easy.

1023
01:10:22,188 --> 01:10:23,892
All clear! All clear!

1024
01:10:24,297 --> 01:10:27,500
Okay, police is just around these corners,
go as fast as you can. Go!

1025
01:10:27,525 --> 01:10:29,461
- Nice!
- You're coming. Aren't you?

1026
01:10:29,486 --> 01:10:32,561
No. Everyone's still in lock down.
I'm gonna try to warn as many as I can, OK?

1027
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:33,861
Not alone, you are not.

1028
01:10:33,892 --> 01:10:35,593
- Mrs Crawford.
- Go everyone. Run!

1029
01:10:35,802 --> 01:10:37,433
So you get to see where they are.

1030
01:10:37,599 --> 01:10:38,740
Come on. Go.

1031
01:10:38,961 --> 01:10:40,601
You are obviously very smart.

1032
01:10:41,165 --> 01:10:42,407
Come on.

1033
01:10:43,486 --> 01:10:45,868
And I don't need some local lard ass cop
to tell me that.

1034
01:10:46,232 --> 01:10:48,576
Fair enough,
I could stand to lose a few

1035
01:10:48,601 --> 01:10:51,759
Come on man, you are gonna work
that angle to sensible negotiator

1036
01:10:51,784 --> 01:10:54,988
who shares a bit of his own life?
I don't care how close you are to...

1037
01:10:55,207 --> 01:10:56,723
retirement or about your...

1038
01:10:57,043 --> 01:11:00,660
beloved wife, who you lost,
and now you understand anger too.

1039
01:11:01,114 --> 01:11:02,567
My wife is just fine.

1040
01:11:04,046 --> 01:11:06,312
I'm afraid I can't say the same
about your mother.

1041
01:11:08,537 --> 01:11:10,037
You paid her a visit, didn't you?

1042
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:13,288
Well,

1043
01:11:13,526 --> 01:11:15,917
I hope she's still watching.
I think if she watches

1044
01:11:15,942 --> 01:11:17,823
all the way through,
she will finally be proud.

1045
01:11:17,862 --> 01:11:19,878
Barbara, it's Jane Crawford.

1046
01:11:19,903 --> 01:11:20,925
Jane.

1047
01:11:21,057 --> 01:11:22,542
Jane, we're in here.

1048
01:11:24,128 --> 01:11:28,830
Oh, God! The rooms aren't safe. We have
to get everyone out. Come on. Let's go.

1049
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:30,307
Hurry!

1050
01:11:31,089 --> 01:11:31,940
This way.

1051
01:11:32,182 --> 01:11:33,940
You see, Sheriff,

1052
01:11:34,573 --> 01:11:36,503
I'm an agent of change.

1053
01:11:36,776 --> 01:11:38,643
Midwife of the truth.

1054
01:11:38,831 --> 01:11:40,682
I am an embodiment.

1055
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:42,440
That sounds exhausting.

1056
01:11:43,175 --> 01:11:45,448
Yeah, it's because it hurts
your tiny brain.

1057
01:11:45,972 --> 01:11:49,628
Then why don't you explain it to me
is that you are a small child?

1058
01:11:49,870 --> 01:11:52,448
In a way that I have to explain
everything to everyone?

1059
01:11:53,081 --> 01:11:54,198
Yes.

1060
01:11:54,566 --> 01:11:56,151
You really put me on the spot sheriff.

1061
01:11:57,722 --> 01:11:59,073
But I'll give it a try.

1062
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,429
I could have the people
in this room

1063
01:12:02,462 --> 01:12:05,591
do the most vile things to each other
in order to stay alive.

1064
01:12:07,165 --> 01:12:08,351
And they would.

1065
01:12:08,814 --> 01:12:09,720
Right?

1066
01:12:13,432 --> 01:12:14,955
That doesn't interest me.

1067
01:12:17,159 --> 01:12:19,307
See, humanity is a joke,

1068
01:12:19,407 --> 01:12:21,489
and you my friend
are the punch line.

1069
01:12:21,589 --> 01:12:23,831
You are the sheep, and I am the Shephard.

1070
01:12:23,931 --> 01:12:26,130
And I am going to lead you all
to the fucking cliff

1071
01:12:26,230 --> 01:12:29,228
because you've been begging for it.

1072
01:12:29,533 --> 01:12:31,822
Tristan, nobody in that room
asked for this.

1073
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:35,103
Oh, come on! That is fucking bullshit.

1074
01:12:35,853 --> 01:12:37,728
Okay? Everybody watching

1075
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:41,657
is culpable, you all post,
and you tweet and you share.

1076
01:12:41,682 --> 01:12:44,427
Everybody jumps for the chance
to be both judge and jury.

1077
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:49,073
But in that system, Sheriff,
you've have created a job opening.

1078
01:12:50,674 --> 01:12:52,252
An executioner.

1079
01:12:54,573 --> 01:12:56,495
You created me.

1080
01:13:00,197 --> 01:13:01,385
So...

1081
01:13:01,854 --> 01:13:05,119
Do you feel that you have made your point?
Is that what you wanted?

1082
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,995
Yeah, sure, yeah. Great job, Sheriff.

1083
01:13:10,724 --> 01:13:11,861
You've worked it all out.

1084
01:13:11,961 --> 01:13:13,173
If there is no hard feelings

1085
01:13:13,273 --> 01:13:15,507
I'd love to invite you up
to my new cabin in Broken Bow.

1086
01:13:15,607 --> 01:13:18,829
We can pack up with some cold ones,
shoot the shit.

1087
01:13:18,893 --> 01:13:20,453
Play some pool.

1088
01:13:20,682 --> 01:13:23,158
I guess, all I needed today
was to talk to some old fuck.

1089
01:13:23,213 --> 01:13:24,753
Go figure, right?

1090
01:13:24,932 --> 01:13:26,017
Tristan,

1091
01:13:26,142 --> 01:13:27,846
I am asking you

1092
01:13:28,314 --> 01:13:30,807
Please! Let those kids go.

1093
01:13:32,867 --> 01:13:37,030
How can we get everyone out
of that room safely including yourself?

1094
01:13:37,273 --> 01:13:38,695
- It's not looking good.
- Hey!

1095
01:13:44,465 --> 01:13:46,879
Someone is letting the things out.

1096
01:13:48,903 --> 01:13:50,723
I see what you did there, sheriff.

1097
01:13:52,411 --> 01:13:53,473
My turn.

1098
01:13:57,090 --> 01:13:59,028
- Right this way.
- Mom.

1099
01:13:59,341 --> 01:14:00,864
Connor.

1100
01:14:03,544 --> 01:14:04,942
Thank God.

1101
01:14:08,012 --> 01:14:10,059
Hey. Did you see Zoe Hull in there?

1102
01:14:10,084 --> 01:14:12,130
Yeah, she got dirty blond hair,
she's tall, skinny--

1103
01:14:12,155 --> 01:14:13,959
I know. She saved us.

1104
01:14:14,515 --> 01:14:17,222
She was even outside at one point
but she went back inside to help.

1105
01:14:17,322 --> 01:14:20,352
Ma'am, just a few more questions
for your son, if you wouldn't mind.

1106
01:14:20,845 --> 01:14:22,134
Right this way.

1107
01:14:22,728 --> 01:14:24,087
Anyway, I've got a number....

1108
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:26,649
It's not fast, and it's not furious,
none of that shit.

1109
01:14:27,279 --> 01:14:29,294
Little closer to "Tortoise & The Hare".

1110
01:14:29,646 --> 01:14:32,381
That's the reason I want
the OG twist ending so...

1111
01:14:32,552 --> 01:14:34,474
please, watch and see.

1112
01:14:34,724 --> 01:14:37,298
It's like, it's not safe
to shelter in place

1113
01:14:37,322 --> 01:14:39,896
that shooters are going around
to the different rooms.

1114
01:14:40,271 --> 01:14:42,537
Rounding up the kids
and bringing them

1115
01:14:42,617 --> 01:14:45,193
to the cafeteria, and that's dangerous.
But we gonna have to go.

1116
01:14:45,292 --> 01:14:48,041
Everyone, we have to get up,
and we've to get out of here.

1117
01:14:51,358 --> 01:14:52,795
Anna.

1118
01:14:56,866 --> 01:14:58,170
Kip?

1119
01:15:01,105 --> 01:15:03,214
Okay, look, if nobody
from my team is responding,

1120
01:15:03,314 --> 01:15:05,831
is it safe to say
that this might be our guardian angel?

1121
01:15:08,665 --> 01:15:09,978
Will you please talk to me?

1122
01:15:11,809 --> 01:15:12,408
No?

1123
01:15:13,764 --> 01:15:17,225
Maybe like the rest of the world
you're watching our show?

1124
01:15:22,392 --> 01:15:25,056
I already asked nicely once.

1125
01:15:27,582 --> 01:15:28,676
I'm here.

1126
01:15:29,533 --> 01:15:30,892
Well, hello!

1127
01:15:32,501 --> 01:15:34,150
You're a chick.

1128
01:15:35,494 --> 01:15:36,892
What's your name, sweetheart?

1129
01:15:38,087 --> 01:15:39,634
It's Zoe Hull.

1130
01:15:41,619 --> 01:15:43,001
It's vaguely familiar.

1131
01:15:44,025 --> 01:15:46,525
So, if you are talking to me
from Anna's phone...

1132
01:15:47,814 --> 01:15:49,330
She's dead.

1133
01:15:50,931 --> 01:15:51,813
Huh?

1134
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:55,456
And Kip?

1135
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:58,551
Alive.

1136
01:16:00,428 --> 01:16:01,959
Wishing he was dead.

1137
01:16:02,294 --> 01:16:05,857
You've really made a mess of things, Zoe,
you've really pissed in my corn flakes.

1138
01:16:06,326 --> 01:16:09,014
Do you want more people to die?
Is that why you did this?

1139
01:16:09,123 --> 01:16:10,647
No. That's the last thing I want.

1140
01:16:10,897 --> 01:16:12,475
All right, well.

1141
01:16:13,037 --> 01:16:14,254
Here is what happens now.

1142
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:17,190
You're gonna drop whatever
you're doing and you're gonna come to me.

1143
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:18,964
You're gonna beg for my forgiveness

1144
01:16:19,102 --> 01:16:22,860
and that of my friend Chris, cause that
was his little sister you just cut down.

1145
01:16:24,007 --> 01:16:28,267
And to help motivate you, I'm gonna kill
one person in this room every five minutes

1146
01:16:28,391 --> 01:16:29,519
you don't show your face.

1147
01:16:29,619 --> 01:16:30,711
Zoe, he'll kill you.

1148
01:16:30,736 --> 01:16:33,063
And the timer starts now.

1149
01:16:34,336 --> 01:16:36,383
Stop! Stop! I'm on my way. Okay?

1150
01:16:36,690 --> 01:16:37,386
You can't just--

1151
01:16:37,486 --> 01:16:39,878
Get them out of here,
and yourself too. Go!

1152
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:48,248
See, I don't make threats.

1153
01:16:49,365 --> 01:16:51,599
Okay? I provide
opportunities for growth.

1154
01:16:54,053 --> 01:16:56,483
Move. Out of the way,
out of the way, get back.

1155
01:16:56,514 --> 01:17:00,310
Move. Move, out of the way,
come on, let's go, let's go.

1156
01:17:00,335 --> 01:17:03,147
Move it, move it,
out of the way. Out of the way.

1157
01:17:03,172 --> 01:17:04,788
Move. Come on. Let's go.

1158
01:17:04,813 --> 01:17:07,498
Move it, move it. Let's go.

1159
01:17:07,523 --> 01:17:09,272
Move. Move. Come on.

1160
01:17:09,726 --> 01:17:11,468
Let's go. Move it.

1161
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,179
Move.

1162
01:17:18,468 --> 01:17:22,031
Keep it moving.
Keep it moving. Move. Move.

1163
01:17:46,974 --> 01:17:48,825
Please. Kill me.

1164
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:53,354
I shot Vicky Wolves
when she was running away.

1165
01:17:55,264 --> 01:17:57,772
She always used to smile at me.

1166
01:18:01,172 --> 01:18:02,993
You have to pay for her murder.

1167
01:18:03,508 --> 01:18:05,376
And all the others, believe it.

1168
01:18:05,938 --> 01:18:07,062
What are you doing?

1169
01:18:07,113 --> 01:18:09,349
Tik Tock, Zoe.

1170
01:18:11,415 --> 01:18:13,080
I'm bad with numbers.

1171
01:18:14,703 --> 01:18:16,461
But, has it been...

1172
01:18:17,406 --> 01:18:18,703
two minutes or...

1173
01:18:19,117 --> 01:18:20,641
four and a half?

1174
01:18:20,666 --> 01:18:22,446
Okay. Right now.

1175
01:18:22,594 --> 01:18:25,453
Right now, you are just a sad fat kid

1176
01:18:25,478 --> 01:18:27,440
everyone in the world
will hate,

1177
01:18:27,465 --> 01:18:30,805
and when they look for a motive,
they'll find out you were bullied.

1178
01:18:30,926 --> 01:18:34,614
Someone will remember that day
in the assembly

1179
01:18:34,762 --> 01:18:38,270
and strangers will laugh at you
all over again.

1180
01:18:39,231 --> 01:18:41,325
Do you want that to be your legacy?

1181
01:18:47,786 --> 01:18:49,857
Very good. Come on.

1182
01:18:53,196 --> 01:18:54,524
Whoa. Whoa, whoa!

1183
01:18:56,718 --> 01:18:59,824
- Where do you want us to stage?
- Copy. They just landed.

1184
01:19:00,268 --> 01:19:01,362
Right up here.

1185
01:19:16,053 --> 01:19:17,701
I'll kill another I guess.

1186
01:19:17,756 --> 01:19:18,873
Wait!

1187
01:19:19,248 --> 01:19:20,358
Wait!

1188
01:19:24,756 --> 01:19:25,905
Fuck.

1189
01:19:25,974 --> 01:19:27,209
You?

1190
01:19:28,482 --> 01:19:30,349
Green Jacket girl?

1191
01:19:32,146 --> 01:19:34,333
When is the last time you
took that damn thing off?

1192
01:19:40,185 --> 01:19:42,490
Don't be shy, come in. Join us.

1193
01:19:43,474 --> 01:19:45,646
You can kill me,
just as easily, right here.

1194
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:50,584
I know. But, that would be terrible
for rating. So, come in.

1195
01:19:53,795 --> 01:19:56,147
I literally insist.

1196
01:20:01,398 --> 01:20:02,781
Zoe, America.

1197
01:20:02,944 --> 01:20:06,141
America, this is Zoe. Our guardian angel.

1198
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:10,394
Zoe.

1199
01:20:10,642 --> 01:20:13,351
While you've been prancing around
doing God knows what

1200
01:20:13,376 --> 01:20:15,525
we've managed to make
national television.

1201
01:20:16,976 --> 01:20:18,741
Fuck, I mean I figure
at the rate we are going

1202
01:20:18,765 --> 01:20:20,480
we'll probably make international too.

1203
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:23,261
And for those playing the home game

1204
01:20:24,254 --> 01:20:28,230
we've just unlocked the bonus round
for 'Anything can happen.'

1205
01:20:39,449 --> 01:20:41,512
What? Fame doesn't do it for you, Zoe?

1206
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:43,558
No.

1207
01:20:46,082 --> 01:20:47,277
What does?

1208
01:20:48,207 --> 01:20:49,543
People.

1209
01:20:50,949 --> 01:20:53,199
Myself included, not dying.

1210
01:20:56,142 --> 01:20:58,126
And what does it for you?

1211
01:21:03,009 --> 01:21:04,494
Being definitive.

1212
01:21:06,369 --> 01:21:09,275
And creating the ultimate version
of something.

1213
01:21:10,064 --> 01:21:12,627
I don't even have to be the first,
I just have to be

1214
01:21:13,150 --> 01:21:14,509
the best.

1215
01:21:16,408 --> 01:21:17,963
You killed my sister?

1216
01:21:20,025 --> 01:21:21,674
She was trying to kill me.

1217
01:21:22,773 --> 01:21:24,681
I mean none of this
ever had to happen--

1218
01:21:25,224 --> 01:21:27,270
None of this ever had to happen.

1219
01:21:30,712 --> 01:21:33,202
God damn! Stand still, you bastards.

1220
01:21:33,471 --> 01:21:36,275
Zoe, did somebody tip you off
as to what we had planned?

1221
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:38,721
- No.
- So, it was just a...

1222
01:21:39,275 --> 01:21:41,384
right time, right place kind of situation?

1223
01:21:41,718 --> 01:21:43,156
Something like that.

1224
01:21:44,361 --> 01:21:46,314
She has to die, not just in...

1225
01:21:46,322 --> 01:21:48,978
I will tell you
when it's the right time, Chris.

1226
01:21:49,152 --> 01:21:50,463
Chris, I will tell you

1227
01:21:50,563 --> 01:21:52,404
- when it is the right time.
- For Anna!

1228
01:21:52,818 --> 01:21:53,935
Okay?

1229
01:21:57,706 --> 01:22:01,073
He's obviously
and understandably upset about his...

1230
01:22:06,726 --> 01:22:07,648
sister.

1231
01:22:10,789 --> 01:22:12,763
I don't know
who the hell are you.

1232
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:15,882
It's over.

1233
01:22:18,257 --> 01:22:19,319
Kiper.

1234
01:22:21,561 --> 01:22:23,436
You didn't have the stomach
for it after all.

1235
01:22:25,913 --> 01:22:27,686
Drop the guns.

1236
01:22:27,952 --> 01:22:29,669
- I'm not kidding.
- If we don't, Kip,

1237
01:22:29,769 --> 01:22:31,474
you are gonna have to do
a lot more killing.

1238
01:22:31,574 --> 01:22:34,456
Do you wanna do more killing, Kip?
Are you prepared to do that?

1239
01:22:37,465 --> 01:22:39,512
Put it down.

1240
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:41,543
You put it down, asshole!

1241
01:22:41,568 --> 01:22:42,863
Fuck you!

1242
01:22:51,756 --> 01:22:52,905
Hey!

1243
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:00,491
Come on! Come on, Lewis!

1244
01:23:01,266 --> 01:23:02,977
Keep going, keep going.

1245
01:23:03,393 --> 01:23:04,199
I'll bring 'em back.

1246
01:23:04,227 --> 01:23:07,483
No. Go kill them and bring back
the fucking phone.

1247
01:23:11,943 --> 01:23:12,732
Come on.

1248
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:15,216
Lewis, Come on.
Keep going. Keep going.

1249
01:23:17,248 --> 01:23:20,513
Everybody stay the fuck down!
This is not over.

1250
01:23:23,701 --> 01:23:24,560
Run.

1251
01:23:24,623 --> 01:23:25,857
Lewis, run.

1252
01:23:26,764 --> 01:23:28,978
Shit, shit. Come on.

1253
01:23:29,041 --> 01:23:29,752
Leave me.

1254
01:23:29,803 --> 01:23:32,339
Leave you? What kind of this is that?
Come on!

1255
01:23:34,846 --> 01:23:36,340
You're okay? You were hit?

1256
01:23:36,584 --> 01:23:38,509
Hence the "leave me" idea. Yeah.

1257
01:23:38,813 --> 01:23:40,077
How bad is it?

1258
01:23:40,262 --> 01:23:43,618
Well, according to you nothing matters
if it happens at high school.

1259
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:45,741
Okay, okay.

1260
01:23:47,037 --> 01:23:48,405
Okay. Come on.

1261
01:23:48,436 --> 01:23:49,655
Come on.

1262
01:23:50,014 --> 01:23:51,694
Come on. You got this.

1263
01:23:56,241 --> 01:23:57,991
You're okay. You're okay.

1264
01:23:58,428 --> 01:24:00,029
No, no, no! No, no, no!

1265
01:24:00,108 --> 01:24:01,522
I don't want them to see us. Okay?

1266
01:24:01,723 --> 01:24:03,223
I don't want them to see us.

1267
01:24:06,997 --> 01:24:08,653
- It's cold in here.
- No!

1268
01:24:09,091 --> 01:24:11,091
No. You're not allowed to do that. Okay?

1269
01:24:14,708 --> 01:24:15,755
Right here.

1270
01:24:16,835 --> 01:24:18,304
Shit. Shit!

1271
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:20,743
Okay. Let me see.

1272
01:24:21,751 --> 01:24:22,798
I need to tell you something.

1273
01:24:22,817 --> 01:24:24,184
No, not now.

1274
01:24:24,603 --> 01:24:25,900
Okay? Just...

1275
01:24:26,384 --> 01:24:28,439
- tell me at prom.
- Yeah.

1276
01:24:34,446 --> 01:24:37,298
You are not
the only good thing in my life.

1277
01:24:38,306 --> 01:24:40,009
Oh, you are the best thing.

1278
01:24:40,861 --> 01:24:43,195
Yeah, that's... so great.

1279
01:24:45,972 --> 01:24:47,263
And I feel the same way.

1280
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:50,128
But I really do need
to tell you something.

1281
01:24:50,152 --> 01:24:52,270
I think the vans
are rigged to explode.

1282
01:24:53,629 --> 01:24:55,747
- They are in the cafeteria?
- Yeah.

1283
01:24:57,979 --> 01:24:58,525
Shit!

1284
01:24:58,756 --> 01:25:00,269
- No, you stay.
- I can't.

1285
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:40,960
This part I remember perfectly.

1286
01:25:56,696 --> 01:25:58,024
You and me.

1287
01:26:00,258 --> 01:26:01,625
We're stuck in a loop.

1288
01:26:09,463 --> 01:26:11,088
You know, it's not always you.

1289
01:26:13,193 --> 01:26:14,271
But every time

1290
01:26:14,451 --> 01:26:15,654
I'm in this room

1291
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:17,435
I kill something.

1292
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:20,686
Shit.

1293
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:27,615
Killing my sister was new.

1294
01:26:28,818 --> 01:26:30,732
How'd you break that pattern, huh?

1295
01:26:34,232 --> 01:26:35,894
It was the symbols, wasn't it?

1296
01:26:36,552 --> 01:26:37,240
Yeah.

1297
01:26:38,465 --> 01:26:40,527
Almost got them in the right order.

1298
01:26:42,051 --> 01:26:43,785
Been collecting 'em longer than you.

1299
01:26:43,925 --> 01:26:45,004
So...

1300
01:26:45,465 --> 01:26:48,379
fuck you, if you think
you're gonna get out before me!

1301
01:26:56,243 --> 01:26:57,407
No.

1302
01:27:21,787 --> 01:27:23,951
Wait, wait!

1303
01:27:24,045 --> 01:27:25,927
It was the symbols.

1304
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:28,748
That, it's hard to change the pattern.

1305
01:27:28,773 --> 01:27:29,663
Oh yeah?

1306
01:27:31,235 --> 01:27:33,789
I can show you the way out.

1307
01:27:35,102 --> 01:27:38,735
That's exactly what they told me
you'd say.

1308
01:28:03,067 --> 01:28:04,825
There. Tree line.

1309
01:28:05,358 --> 01:28:07,303
Hands up. Hands up.

1310
01:28:08,014 --> 01:28:09,881
Show us your hands.

1311
01:28:11,256 --> 01:28:13,170
On the ground! On the ground!

1312
01:28:13,303 --> 01:28:14,858
On the ground.

1313
01:28:15,897 --> 01:28:17,256
On the ground.

1314
01:28:22,248 --> 01:28:23,272
Chris.

1315
01:28:26,055 --> 01:28:27,250
Report back, man.

1316
01:28:47,974 --> 01:28:49,130
Chris.

1317
01:28:49,904 --> 01:28:51,888
Come on, man. Answer me.

1318
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,708
Fight!

1319
01:29:08,154 --> 01:29:09,966
Chris, man, answer me.

1320
01:29:16,575 --> 01:29:17,857
What do you think?

1321
01:29:18,630 --> 01:29:19,927
Worth a thousand words?

1322
01:29:33,497 --> 01:29:34,552
Fuck.

1323
01:29:44,122 --> 01:29:46,247
Now, you're the one not talking?

1324
01:29:51,779 --> 01:29:53,685
What's wrong, Tristan?

1325
01:29:54,810 --> 01:29:57,130
I thought we've built up
a nice support.

1326
01:30:00,107 --> 01:30:01,935
Am I not being polite enough?

1327
01:30:07,472 --> 01:30:11,432
With no response, can I assume
you are watching my stream?

1328
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:27,895
You have no fucking idea
who you're dealing with.

1329
01:30:28,403 --> 01:30:29,638
You know, you're right.

1330
01:30:30,047 --> 01:30:33,125
You actually
are starting to slip my mind.

1331
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:36,815
I mean... isn't it ironic?

1332
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:41,290
That after all your goddamn hard work

1333
01:30:42,288 --> 01:30:44,905
people aren't gonna remember you?

1334
01:30:46,086 --> 01:30:47,078
No?

1335
01:30:47,695 --> 01:30:48,718
No.

1336
01:30:51,086 --> 01:30:52,851
They are gonna remember me.

1337
01:31:14,453 --> 01:31:15,937
- Get up. On your feet.
- Please.

1338
01:31:15,962 --> 01:31:16,546
Please.

1339
01:31:16,593 --> 01:31:18,414
Move! Get up on your feet!

1340
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:20,108
Everybody else stay the fuck down.

1341
01:31:20,171 --> 01:31:22,827
Noses to the ground.
If you look at me I will fucking kill you.

1342
01:31:22,852 --> 01:31:24,882
Take this and move. Go. Go!

1343
01:31:25,421 --> 01:31:26,812
Go!

1344
01:31:33,343 --> 01:31:34,625
I was praying that it was you.

1345
01:31:34,656 --> 01:31:36,132
I thought I told you to get outside.

1346
01:31:36,171 --> 01:31:38,460
I will now. This is the last group
from the roofs.

1347
01:31:39,492 --> 01:31:41,819
- Are you coming with us this time?
- I'll be right there.

1348
01:31:41,929 --> 01:31:43,515
I'll be right there.

1349
01:31:44,671 --> 01:31:46,718
All right. Come on. Let's go.

1350
01:31:51,429 --> 01:31:53,601
All right. Just like your mama taught you.

1351
01:31:53,951 --> 01:31:56,309
It really does not have to be difficult.

1352
01:32:10,438 --> 01:32:11,648
Keep moving.

1353
01:32:11,673 --> 01:32:12,900
Keep walking.

1354
01:32:13,555 --> 01:32:16,038
All right? Do not turn around.

1355
01:32:16,127 --> 01:32:17,174
Fuck.

1356
01:32:20,396 --> 01:32:21,978
Okay.

1357
01:32:24,781 --> 01:32:27,648
Get out! Now! Okay?
He's gone. Go!

1358
01:32:35,073 --> 01:32:37,098
Jesus Christ! Jesus.

1359
01:32:37,608 --> 01:32:39,006
There is a bomb in there!

1360
01:32:39,150 --> 01:32:41,064
Go! Go! Please! Come on!

1361
01:32:41,674 --> 01:32:43,939
Good! Good! Keep going!

1362
01:32:44,438 --> 01:32:46,023
Over here. Help me!

1363
01:32:46,062 --> 01:32:48,110
Good. Faster! Move, move.

1364
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:50,574
Good, good. Keep going. Keep going.

1365
01:32:51,059 --> 01:32:52,432
Go. Go.

1366
01:32:56,710 --> 01:32:57,640
Shit.

1367
01:33:27,793 --> 01:33:29,219
All right. Let's go. Let's go!

1368
01:33:29,287 --> 01:33:30,697
Move. Go. Go.

1369
01:33:34,996 --> 01:33:36,711
All right. Let's go! Let's move it!

1370
01:33:47,449 --> 01:33:48,638
Oh my God.

1371
01:34:07,192 --> 01:34:08,278
Stop!

1372
01:34:08,553 --> 01:34:10,428
Stop! On your knees.

1373
01:34:11,131 --> 01:34:12,365
Put your hands high.

1374
01:34:12,545 --> 01:34:14,357
Get 'em up. Above your head.

1375
01:34:26,894 --> 01:34:28,598
Bravo team. We're on the first floor.

1376
01:34:29,144 --> 01:34:30,871
Suspect is neutralized.

1377
01:34:32,863 --> 01:34:35,441
Hey, fall through, fall through.
Let me know when you got a clear.

1378
01:34:35,466 --> 01:34:38,215
Hey, I said on the fucking ground!
Get on the fucking ground!

1379
01:34:41,365 --> 01:34:42,498
Come on.

1380
01:34:55,787 --> 01:34:57,881
Oh, that's gratitude for you?

1381
01:35:06,787 --> 01:35:09,045
Don't they know who you are?

1382
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:13,717
You look beautiful.

1383
01:35:15,264 --> 01:35:16,443
I know.

1384
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:19,859
It feels good.

1385
01:35:21,617 --> 01:35:22,679
Thank you.

1386
01:35:29,373 --> 01:35:30,725
I have to go now.

1387
01:35:32,548 --> 01:35:33,650
I love you.

1388
01:35:37,302 --> 01:35:38,474
Goodbye.

1389
01:36:32,856 --> 01:36:35,561
You freed up in your hands
so I could shake one.

1390
01:36:40,328 --> 01:36:42,914
SWAT guys had no idea
who you were so...

1391
01:36:43,696 --> 01:36:45,305
I'm sorry about that.

1392
01:36:48,328 --> 01:36:50,766
You know, lot of folks
have a lot of questions for you.

1393
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:54,797
But we can talk about that later.

1394
01:36:57,821 --> 01:37:00,094
That was a hell of a thing
you did in there.

1395
01:37:00,274 --> 01:37:01,399
Really.

1396
01:37:01,424 --> 01:37:04,071
- All we are very proud of you, Zoe.
- And Tristan?

1397
01:37:04,787 --> 01:37:05,857
Dead.

1398
01:37:05,995 --> 01:37:07,252
Burned to a crisp.

1399
01:37:08,354 --> 01:37:10,549
I wouldn't wish that on anyone.

1400
01:37:11,502 --> 01:37:12,642
Well...

1401
01:37:13,244 --> 01:37:14,517
almost anyone.

1402
01:37:21,807 --> 01:37:23,197
Standby one.

1403
01:37:24,315 --> 01:37:26,494
Can I ask you to do something for me?

1404
01:37:27,463 --> 01:37:28,330
Name it.

1405
01:37:38,468 --> 01:37:39,616
You were right.

1406
01:37:45,156 --> 01:37:46,601
I was at war.

1407
01:37:48,289 --> 01:37:50,195
Thank Christ for that.

1408
01:37:56,337 --> 01:37:58,064
Mom would know

1409
01:37:58,587 --> 01:38:00,517
just what to say right now, wouldn't she?

1410
01:38:00,931 --> 01:38:02,447
Yes, she would.

1411
01:38:04,150 --> 01:38:06,595
I guess that's why
I still talk to her sometimes.

1412
01:38:07,336 --> 01:38:08,390
Really?

1413
01:38:09,234 --> 01:38:10,507
Yeah.

1414
01:38:12,010 --> 01:38:13,183
It's creepy.

1415
01:38:16,487 --> 01:38:17,412
Yeah.

1416
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,541
Thanks for saving my life.

1417
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:25,898
Honey...

1418
01:38:26,255 --> 01:38:27,747
we are even.

1419
01:38:29,544 --> 01:38:31,793
You gave mine a purpose

1420
01:38:33,730 --> 01:38:35,620
eighteen years ago.

1421
01:38:43,189 --> 01:38:44,110
Hey!

1422
01:38:44,116 --> 01:38:45,412
Is he gonna be okay?

1423
01:38:45,437 --> 01:38:46,670
Yeah, should be.

1424
01:38:46,708 --> 01:38:48,412
We need to take a look
at that leg.

1425
01:38:48,623 --> 01:38:51,060
Oh, I'll be right over.

1426
01:38:54,524 --> 01:38:56,227
Hey man, in a moment.

1427
01:39:02,505 --> 01:39:04,107
What did they do with your rifle?

1428
01:39:04,146 --> 01:39:05,473
Nothing yet.

1429
01:39:05,606 --> 01:39:08,271
Last I saw it
there was some little yellow

1430
01:39:08,296 --> 01:39:10,145
evidence markers around it.

1431
01:39:15,473 --> 01:39:16,988
It should be right where I left it.

1432
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:39,745
Oh.

1433
01:40:43,355 --> 01:40:47,330
I didn't expect
to deal with this scenario.

1434
01:40:50,784 --> 01:40:54,461
But there is unfinished business
to tend to.

1435
01:40:56,378 --> 01:40:58,034
You see, it's tempting

1436
01:40:58,222 --> 01:41:00,386
to let nature run its course.

1437
01:41:01,892 --> 01:41:04,455
The lungs will fill with blood.

1438
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:08,141
And the animal will die naturally.

1439
01:41:11,703 --> 01:41:13,695
But with that process

1440
01:41:14,150 --> 01:41:16,085
comes extreme pain.

1441
01:41:28,359 --> 01:41:31,078
And it just isn't right to let it suffer.

1442
01:41:41,773 --> 01:41:43,273
Or is it?

1443
01:42:23,870 --> 01:42:26,081
# The Eastern world #

1444
01:42:26,597 --> 01:42:28,565
# It is explodin' #

1445
01:42:29,612 --> 01:42:31,292
# Violence flaring, #

1446
01:42:31,784 --> 01:42:33,581
