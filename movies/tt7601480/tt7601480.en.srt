Don't stop!

3
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:39,920
Come on!

4
00:00:41,254 --> 00:00:42,104
Trying to escape?

5
00:00:47,545 --> 00:00:48,378
There it is!

6
00:00:48,462 --> 00:00:49,296
Gotcha!

7
00:00:50,337 --> 00:00:51,837
How about that, mutt?

8
00:00:53,546 --> 00:00:55,087
Don't wanna play with us, eh?

9
00:00:56,462 --> 00:00:57,337
Mutt…

10
00:00:58,004 --> 00:01:00,054
Dudes, I'm going for a three-pointer now!

11
00:01:06,296 --> 00:01:07,796
Leave the dog alone!

12
00:01:13,546 --> 00:01:14,712
Hey you, sucker!

13
00:01:14,796 --> 00:01:16,170
Looking for trouble?

14
00:01:16,254 --> 00:01:17,087
Sucker…

15
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:20,837
You just leave the dog alone!

16
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:23,004
He asked for it.

17
00:01:30,087 --> 00:01:32,629
Twenty years later

18
00:01:50,004 --> 00:01:52,087
Holy shit!

19
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:53,921
Seal the bags! Now!

20
00:01:58,587 --> 00:01:59,920
Put it back!

21
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:01,962
-Hey you, be careful!
-Money, money…

22
00:02:06,462 --> 00:02:07,504
Who the hell is he?!

23
00:02:11,837 --> 00:02:13,987
Shut the door on him
before we go bankrupt!

24
00:02:16,796 --> 00:02:17,712
Step on it!

25
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:20,462
See you later, alligator!

26
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:26,396
You can't get us!

27
00:02:39,754 --> 00:02:41,671
Stuff it back in, you clumsy moron!

28
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:47,587
Amigo! We have a problem.

29
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:50,378
Give me a second. I'll handle it.

30
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,087
-Break through it.
-What?

31
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,212
-Break through it!
-I'm on it!

32
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:08,546
Get back to work!

33
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:09,920
Go!

34
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:19,212
Go, go!

35
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:29,087
Can you break a 5000 note for me, pals?

36
00:03:34,712 --> 00:03:35,587
Igor Grom was

37
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:38,629
a true hero.

38
00:03:39,796 --> 00:03:42,879
He was a role model for all of us.

39
00:03:44,712 --> 00:03:47,462
He was a great man.

40
00:03:50,212 --> 00:03:51,212
We are going

41
00:03:53,212 --> 00:03:54,462
to miss him.

42
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:07,129
Think.

43
00:04:36,254 --> 00:04:37,296
You've got balls.

44
00:04:38,504 --> 00:04:39,629
Think!

45
00:04:45,212 --> 00:04:46,296
He's on the roof!

46
00:04:57,504 --> 00:04:58,462
Lose him!

47
00:05:02,296 --> 00:05:03,129
Pull over!

48
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,337
What?

49
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:17,921
I filmed everything.

50
00:05:27,087 --> 00:05:28,337
Igor!

51
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:30,671
Hop in! We got it covered!

52
00:05:31,504 --> 00:05:33,087
I'll do it. Give me some water.

53
00:05:33,962 --> 00:05:35,421
Igor, are you okay?

54
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:41,296
Holy shit.

55
00:05:42,837 --> 00:05:43,795
Igor!

56
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,212
Central, do you copy me?

57
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:49,504
Amigo! Cops!

58
00:05:50,337 --> 00:05:51,637
What do you want me to do?

59
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:54,962
Ready!

60
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:57,379
Maintain your positions!

61
00:05:58,837 --> 00:05:59,671
Step on it.

62
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:02,546
Fire!

63
00:06:22,296 --> 00:06:24,170
On this special day

64
00:06:24,254 --> 00:06:26,129
I am happy to announce

65
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:28,337
that the streets of our city are

66
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,171
quiet and safe now.

67
00:06:30,837 --> 00:06:31,670
My colleague here

68
00:06:31,754 --> 00:06:32,962
can confirm it.

69
00:06:33,962 --> 00:06:35,754
The crime rate has hit

70
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,112
-the lowest…
-Run for your life!

71
00:06:40,837 --> 00:06:41,670
Clear the way!

72
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:54,171
Fyodor Ivanovich.

73
00:06:55,462 --> 00:06:56,462
Igor…

74
00:07:38,754 --> 00:07:39,804
Who the hell are you?

MAJOR GROM

00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,754

107
00:11:05,254 --> 00:11:09,045
Hey, Oobie Doobie! Welcome to the Police
Directorate of Saint-Petersburg!

108
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:10,004
My name is Dubin.

109
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,837
You'd better have a sense of humor here.
Let's go.

110
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:15,253
A police officer will be assigned
to mentor you.

111
00:11:15,337 --> 00:11:17,170
You'll receive a trainee's kit

112
00:11:17,254 --> 00:11:20,212
with your uniform, a taser and a torch
to help you always find your way.

113
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:21,420
I'm sorry.

114
00:11:21,504 --> 00:11:22,837
Boss.

115
00:11:22,921 --> 00:11:25,821
You don't go to jail for domestic violence
in this country.

116
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:28,295
But you beat your neighbor.

117
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:30,337
He's like a brother to me, I swear.

118
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:32,462
Okay, will you sign the confession?

119
00:11:32,546 --> 00:11:35,712
Do you want to read the Constitution
of the Russian Federation with me?

120
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:36,920
Sonny…

121
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:39,712
Sonny, when I turned back,
my wallet was already gone.

122
00:11:41,212 --> 00:11:44,296
Pops, your wallet is this small.
And the city is this big.

123
00:11:44,962 --> 00:11:46,462
You think I can find it?

124
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:48,546
You're slow as a snail. Come on!

125
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,420
Welcome to our treasure room.

126
00:11:54,504 --> 00:11:55,629
Hey, Mikhalych.

127
00:11:56,296 --> 00:11:58,587
We store items of evidence here.

128
00:11:58,671 --> 00:12:01,254
The clowns had these guns
when we got them.

129
00:12:04,546 --> 00:12:05,504
Wanna shoot it?

130
00:12:06,754 --> 00:12:07,628
Go ahead!

131
00:12:07,712 --> 00:12:08,629
Are you an idiot?

132
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,412
Never ever touch anything in this room!

133
00:12:12,796 --> 00:12:14,337
You just let me…

134
00:12:14,421 --> 00:12:16,504
That was a joke. Irony, you know?

135
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,503
We have two detention centers here.

136
00:12:19,587 --> 00:12:22,753
Real badass guys go
to solitary confinement cells.

137
00:12:22,837 --> 00:12:25,753
Other lowlifes enjoy the general
population detention center.

138
00:12:25,837 --> 00:12:27,437
FC Zenit is the champion, right?

139
00:12:29,212 --> 00:12:30,412
Let us in, Gennadyevich.

140
00:12:32,212 --> 00:12:33,046
Come on in.

141
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:35,878
Look at the scumbags in there.

142
00:12:35,962 --> 00:12:36,878
You shouldn't say that.

143
00:12:36,962 --> 00:12:40,503
Statistically every fifth person
in detention centers got there

144
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:41,712
by mistake.

145
00:12:41,796 --> 00:12:44,129
Me! They got me by mistake!

146
00:12:46,171 --> 00:12:47,046
Moron.

147
00:12:48,296 --> 00:12:50,129
-You're the moron here.
-What's that?

148
00:12:51,254 --> 00:12:52,753
You're the moron here!

149
00:12:52,837 --> 00:12:54,796
Amigo!

150
00:12:55,337 --> 00:12:56,537
Another day in the life.

151
00:12:57,796 --> 00:12:58,837
You know, kiddo.

152
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:01,670
You have to be special to do this job.

153
00:13:01,754 --> 00:13:04,378
Many people give up
and quit it as soon as they can.

154
00:13:04,462 --> 00:13:06,462
Those who stay fall into two categories:

155
00:13:07,671 --> 00:13:09,212
pussies and hounds.

156
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:13,420
Pussies always save their asses,
passing the buck

157
00:13:13,504 --> 00:13:15,295
and blaming others.

158
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:17,045
Pops.

159
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,837
It wasn't me who stole your wallet.

160
00:13:18,921 --> 00:13:20,629
Sonny, you don't get it.

161
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:23,462
I kept all my pension money there.

162
00:13:23,546 --> 00:13:24,671
And the hounds…

163
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:28,879
They'll do anything to make sure
justice is served in this city.

164
00:13:29,712 --> 00:13:31,628
We pick up the scent of a bad guy

165
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:34,462
and never stop
until he gets what he deserves.

166
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:39,579
That was another joke, right?

167
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:42,546
Tzvetkov, attention!

168
00:13:48,296 --> 00:13:49,296
I wanna see Grom.

169
00:13:55,962 --> 00:13:57,546
Prokopenko is here.

170
00:14:04,337 --> 00:14:05,629
I wanna see Grom!

171
00:14:13,754 --> 00:14:15,171
You'd better sleep at home.

172
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:17,712
Get up.

173
00:14:18,296 --> 00:14:19,796
Prokopenko is calling for you.

174
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:32,379
Hey, is he a cop?

175
00:14:33,254 --> 00:14:34,804
Where did he find a dump truck?

176
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,378
That's gonna be fun.

177
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,253
Hey there. Are you a part-time
dump truck driver now?

178
00:14:43,337 --> 00:14:44,296
Hey man.

179
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:07,421
Let's do it!

180
00:15:18,254 --> 00:15:19,129
What's going on?

181
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,378
They bet on Grom's dismissal.

182
00:15:22,462 --> 00:15:23,662
That's a tradition here.

183
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,128
…destroyed 200 meters of pavement…

184
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:27,379
Fyodor Ivanovich.

185
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:31,962
Sit down.

186
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:34,921
Tell me. What were you doing there?

187
00:15:35,421 --> 00:15:36,753
Today is your day off.

188
00:15:36,837 --> 00:15:38,670
Why did you go after them alone?

189
00:15:38,754 --> 00:15:41,046
-Who cares? I did it.
-You did it?

190
00:15:42,462 --> 00:15:44,004
You created havoc out there.

191
00:15:44,921 --> 00:15:46,420
The street repairs will cost ten mio.

192
00:15:46,504 --> 00:15:48,879
They do it every year anyway.

193
00:15:50,837 --> 00:15:52,337
Spending taxpayers' money.

194
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:53,962
Really?

195
00:15:54,046 --> 00:15:54,921
Yeah.

196
00:15:57,212 --> 00:16:00,412
You know that you put the entire
department under fire? Everyone!

197
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:03,837
This time he's done.

198
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,545
I covered all the bases.

199
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:08,837
You think you're a utility player
or what?! He covered all the bases.

200
00:16:08,921 --> 00:16:10,337
Or are you a superhero?

201
00:16:10,421 --> 00:16:11,254
Are you?

202
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:14,087
I'm sick and tired of your tricks!

203
00:16:16,296 --> 00:16:17,712
You carry no body cameras!

204
00:16:17,796 --> 00:16:19,420
You violate service regulations!

205
00:16:19,504 --> 00:16:21,628
You don't even think
about the consequences!

206
00:16:21,712 --> 00:16:23,546
I can't get it. What do you want?

207
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:26,128
You wanna prove
that you're the toughest cookie?

208
00:16:26,212 --> 00:16:27,462
Am I not?

209
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:31,879
I accomplish more
than the rest of the directorate.

210
00:16:33,796 --> 00:16:37,212
Why the hell are you doing it? Why?

211
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,462
We have to work as a team.

212
00:16:39,546 --> 00:16:42,254
But all you can do is
stick your head out there.

213
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:45,296
And I have to cover your ass.

214
00:16:49,004 --> 00:16:51,587
But this is exactly what you want, right?

215
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:55,254
The clearance rate would go
down the toilet without me.

216
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,629
Leave the service!

217
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:00,429
And then we'll see! Do it!

218
00:17:01,671 --> 00:17:03,712
Here you are! Write a dismissal letter!

219
00:17:08,712 --> 00:17:11,087
'Please be advised
that I voluntarily resign my employment

220
00:17:11,171 --> 00:17:12,837
in the law enforcement community.

221
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:17,004
Please degrade me too.'

222
00:17:18,712 --> 00:17:20,129
Keep writing!

223
00:17:22,254 --> 00:17:23,604
The date and the signature.

224
00:18:17,587 --> 00:18:18,879
Here you go, Pops.

225
00:18:28,296 --> 00:18:29,462
I mean…

226
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:32,795
I threw in 100 rubles.
That's the least we can do for you.

227
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:33,921
Happy to serve you.

228
00:18:39,087 --> 00:18:40,287
News with Anna Terebkina

229
00:18:45,087 --> 00:18:47,921
Hello. I am Anna Terebkina.
And here is today's top news.

230
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:51,087
The Rosgarantbank employees
had barely recovered

231
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,628
after the robbery of the head office

232
00:18:52,712 --> 00:18:55,045
when they got under siege again.

233
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:57,878
The cheated investors and clients want
their money back.

234
00:18:57,962 --> 00:19:01,962
Olga Isayeva who owns the bank declined
to comment on the situation.

235
00:19:02,046 --> 00:19:03,462
In other news.

236
00:19:03,546 --> 00:19:06,837
Today is the last day of the lawsuit
against Kirill Grechkin,

237
00:19:06,921 --> 00:19:08,920
a son of the well-known billionaire.

238
00:19:09,004 --> 00:19:12,253
He has been charged
with a first degree homicide by vehicle.

239
00:19:12,337 --> 00:19:15,712
In April this year Kirill's car hit

240
00:19:15,796 --> 00:19:18,504
Liza Makarova
from the local children's home.

241
00:19:21,387 --> 00:19:24,179
That was the day of our field trip.

242
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:28,304
We came here to see the bascule bridges.

243
00:19:31,262 --> 00:19:33,345
But first I took Liza to a coffee shop

244
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:34,529
to buy some ice cream.

245
00:19:35,054 --> 00:19:37,354
-Look who's there.
-We stepped out of the shop,

246
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,553
-and this moron came out of nowhere.
-Objection! Verbal abuse!

247
00:19:42,637 --> 00:19:44,512
Please, watch your tongue.

248
00:19:48,304 --> 00:19:51,345
Grechkin came out of nowhere. Hammered.

249
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:54,053
Objection! No evidence
of driving under the influence!

250
00:19:54,137 --> 00:19:55,887
-Sustained.
-He bribed them.

251
00:19:55,971 --> 00:19:57,179
Order!

252
00:20:01,012 --> 00:20:02,054
You may continue.

253
00:20:07,762 --> 00:20:08,637
Your Honor.

254
00:20:10,762 --> 00:20:11,846
Liza is…

255
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:14,571
She is my only family.

256
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:19,429
She was…

257
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,512
Okay, got it.

258
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:30,012
If there is any justice in the world,

259
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:33,996
Kirill Grechkin must be punished.

260
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:51,428
Kirill! What do you think
about the court ruling?

261
00:20:51,512 --> 00:20:54,345
Courts in this country are well-known
for their compassion.

262
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:56,303
Kirill, what are you going to do next?

263
00:20:56,387 --> 00:20:58,887
Don't know.
Will go on a vacation or something.

264
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:00,137
Wanna go with me?

265
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:04,095
But first, I am going to file a complaint
against the municipal police.

266
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,845
Major Grom used excessive brutal force
when he arrested me.

267
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:08,554
My arms are still bruised.

268
00:21:09,096 --> 00:21:10,303
Look at them.

269
00:21:10,387 --> 00:21:12,303
That's what I call police lawlessness.

270
00:21:12,387 --> 00:21:14,970
Chill out.

271
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:16,512
Wanna go to jail instead of him?

272
00:21:16,596 --> 00:21:18,553
I don't give a shit!
I'll never let this matter rest!

273
00:21:18,637 --> 00:21:20,037
What else do you wanna know?

274
00:21:23,846 --> 00:21:24,887
Let it go.

275
00:21:30,137 --> 00:21:31,012
Igor.

276
00:21:31,512 --> 00:21:32,387
Hello.

277
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:33,762
Hello.

278
00:21:33,846 --> 00:21:35,845
I'm Tatyana Mikhailovna,
Lyosha's teacher.

279
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:37,879
-Nice to meet you.
-Please, forgive him.

280
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:40,179
-He is grieving.
-I know.

281
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:44,387
-Please, call me if anything.
-Thank you.

282
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,137
Sorry, could you

283
00:21:46,762 --> 00:21:49,462
write it down? Or take a picture?
This is my only card.

284
00:21:50,137 --> 00:21:51,053
Sure.

285
00:21:51,137 --> 00:21:53,512
Thank you! Everyone's free to go now.

286
00:21:53,596 --> 00:21:55,137
Including me.

287
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:35,054
PROKOPENKO: Will you pop by?

288
00:23:39,304 --> 00:23:41,137
Forget about obsolete messengers, websites

289
00:23:41,221 --> 00:23:42,512
and video streaming systems.

290
00:23:42,596 --> 00:23:46,762
Welcome to the first ever AI social media
platform called Vmeste (Together).

291
00:23:47,471 --> 00:23:50,053
You received envelopes
with your personal AR glasses.

292
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,720
You'll find a button on the temple.

293
00:23:51,804 --> 00:23:53,595
Press it to activate the glasses.

294
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,346
Can you see me now?

295
00:23:56,012 --> 00:23:57,845
My name is Margo.

296
00:23:57,929 --> 00:23:59,970
I'm your virtual personal assistant.

297
00:24:00,054 --> 00:24:03,678
Over the last five years Vmeste has become
a top social network…

298
00:24:03,762 --> 00:24:05,512
What happens if they don't like it?

299
00:24:09,054 --> 00:24:12,012
Seryozha, this is your lifetime project.

300
00:24:13,012 --> 00:24:14,562
It will cause a paradigm shift.

301
00:24:18,012 --> 00:24:19,512
-What if…
-No ifs.

302
00:24:21,221 --> 00:24:22,387
Go knock 'em dead.

303
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,762
Please welcome.

304
00:24:26,846 --> 00:24:27,845
I believe in you.

305
00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:30,220
Head of the Vmeste Charity Foundation,

306
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:32,137
an IT guru and a philanthropist.

307
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,929
Please welcome Sergey Razumovskiy.

308
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:45,762
The update we developed

309
00:24:46,304 --> 00:24:47,304
will amaze you.

310
00:24:48,137 --> 00:24:50,237
A picture is
worth a thousand words, right?

311
00:24:50,887 --> 00:24:52,846
Margo, start the presentation.

312
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:58,678
Vmeste 2.0 is not just a regular update.

313
00:24:58,762 --> 00:25:00,178
It's a symbol.

314
00:25:00,262 --> 00:25:02,512
A symbol of the new
and free Russian Internet.

315
00:25:02,596 --> 00:25:06,053
From now on, your personal data will go
through one-way encryption.

316
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:07,762
Which means that no one,

317
00:25:07,846 --> 00:25:10,596
absolutely no one will be able

318
00:25:11,387 --> 00:25:13,429
-to access it.
-Even you?

319
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:14,971
Even me.

320
00:25:16,304 --> 00:25:17,970
You will also

321
00:25:18,054 --> 00:25:20,595
keep your anonymity
while accessing any website.

322
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:23,345
Even those blocked under a court order.

323
00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:24,637
But most importantly,

324
00:25:25,387 --> 00:25:27,054
we grant our customers

325
00:25:27,596 --> 00:25:29,679
unlimited access to various content.

326
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:33,595
You can read books and articles,
listen to music,

327
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,845
and watch movies. The content is free

328
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:39,012
and perfectly legal.

329
00:25:39,096 --> 00:25:41,096
Study and self-education

330
00:25:41,887 --> 00:25:45,387
will help us change our lives
for the better together.

331
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,554
Did they release Grechkin? Really?!

332
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:06,179
I'm sorry.

333
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:11,720
Sergey. You were the star.

334
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:14,137
-Just a reminder. In 15 minutes…
-Cancel all the meetings.

335
00:26:14,221 --> 00:26:15,762
Or reschedule them. I don't know…

336
00:26:15,846 --> 00:26:17,429
-I'm unavailable.
-I'm on it.

337
00:26:18,387 --> 00:26:19,637
Sergey!

338
00:26:46,596 --> 00:26:47,696
Oleg, that's bullshit!

339
00:26:48,346 --> 00:26:49,512
Apparently,

340
00:26:50,221 --> 00:26:51,970
these people are above the law.

341
00:26:52,054 --> 00:26:55,554
They can steal, rape or kill
and get away with it!

342
00:26:56,137 --> 00:26:58,262
I try my best…

343
00:26:58,346 --> 00:27:00,637
…to make people's lives better. But now…

344
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:04,054
It makes no sense now.

345
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:08,762
This girl and her brother…

346
00:27:09,304 --> 00:27:11,354
They came from our children's home, Oleg.

347
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:16,095
How many more humans will be killed
or injured because of Grechkin and alike?

348
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:17,829
Who'll protect people from them?!

349
00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:23,137
There's nothing I can do.

350
00:27:26,137 --> 00:27:27,137
It's an atrocity.

351
00:27:29,012 --> 00:27:30,412
And it's gonna happen again.

352
00:27:32,304 --> 00:27:33,512
No way.

353
00:27:41,221 --> 00:27:42,304
I promise you.

354
00:27:58,804 --> 00:28:01,220
What can we do, Igor?
Rich kids like Grechkin

355
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,679
always get away with it.

356
00:28:04,221 --> 00:28:05,678
Good job.

357
00:28:05,762 --> 00:28:07,846
Thankies.

358
00:28:09,471 --> 00:28:10,929
You know, I remember,

359
00:28:11,762 --> 00:28:13,137
when we worked with your dad,

360
00:28:13,221 --> 00:28:15,345
we often had parties like Grechkin.

361
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:17,970
But like they say, sooner or later

362
00:28:18,054 --> 00:28:19,762
-these motherf…
-Fyodor!

363
00:28:21,346 --> 00:28:22,887
I say, these pricks will get

364
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:24,970
what they deserve.

365
00:28:25,054 --> 00:28:26,303
I know what I'm talking about.

366
00:28:26,387 --> 00:28:28,554
Passing verdicts is not our job.

367
00:28:29,096 --> 00:28:31,387
We search and nail bad guys.

368
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:33,345
And let justice be served.

369
00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:35,137
There's no justice.

370
00:28:35,637 --> 00:28:36,929
The system is rotten.

371
00:28:38,054 --> 00:28:39,553
-To the core.
-Igor…

372
00:28:39,637 --> 00:28:42,137
You work like a dog, you risk your life.

373
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,470
-Keep it quiet.
-You dig up evidence against bastards.

374
00:28:44,554 --> 00:28:46,387
But the court lets them go. Is that okay?

375
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:47,304
Quiet.

376
00:28:47,804 --> 00:28:48,928
We can't break the law.

377
00:28:49,012 --> 00:28:50,679
There's no other way.

378
00:28:51,346 --> 00:28:52,346
What do you suggest?

379
00:28:54,262 --> 00:28:55,212
Boiling them alive?

380
00:28:56,637 --> 00:28:57,471
Or frying them?

381
00:28:59,554 --> 00:29:00,387
Here you are, Igor.

382
00:29:00,471 --> 00:29:01,346
I mended it.

383
00:29:03,304 --> 00:29:04,429
Thanks, Auntie Lena.

384
00:29:05,054 --> 00:29:06,929
Lucky you, Igor.

385
00:29:07,596 --> 00:29:08,470
-Take it easy.
-Why?

386
00:29:08,554 --> 00:29:10,137
-It's no big deal.
-No big deal.

387
00:29:10,221 --> 00:29:12,271
I don't mean that. You have a girlfriend?

388
00:29:12,762 --> 00:29:14,803
-Fyodor…
-He is working all the time.

389
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:16,179
That's his life.

390
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,396
Excuse me. It's a work-related call.

391
00:29:30,471 --> 00:29:32,804
What did I tell you? Work again.

392
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:37,178
You were exactly the same
when you were young.

393
00:29:37,262 --> 00:29:40,137
You had nothing in your life
except work and your bike.

394
00:29:40,221 --> 00:29:41,762
-Hello.
-Hello. Igor?

395
00:29:42,887 --> 00:29:45,845
Tatyana Mikhailovna speaking.
You said I can call you.

396
00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:47,262
Sure. What happened?

397
00:29:47,346 --> 00:29:49,512
I am really worried about Lyosha.
He disappeared.

398
00:29:49,596 --> 00:29:51,553
He didn't have dinner.
He doesn't pick up the phone.

399
00:29:51,637 --> 00:29:53,721
I am afraid he can do something stupid.

400
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:16,679
That was a nice try.

401
00:30:17,637 --> 00:30:19,471
But karma is a bitch.

402
00:30:19,971 --> 00:30:21,679
What do you want?!

403
00:30:23,262 --> 00:30:24,387
I want justice.

404
00:30:25,554 --> 00:30:26,387
No!

405
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:28,429
That's a bad dream. It's not real.

406
00:31:09,512 --> 00:31:10,971
Think!

407
00:31:25,971 --> 00:31:27,054
Perfect.

408
00:31:40,846 --> 00:31:41,887
No way.

409
00:31:45,054 --> 00:31:47,304
Freeze! Police!

410
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:12,929
Okay, Kostya.

411
00:32:13,471 --> 00:32:14,971
I think we've got a match.

412
00:32:15,512 --> 00:32:18,178
Well, Igor, the guy was a suspect.

413
00:32:18,262 --> 00:32:19,637
He is a dangerous offender.

414
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:22,095
He matches your description. Is that him?

415
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:24,221
I've never seen parties like him.

416
00:32:25,221 --> 00:32:27,095
His reaction was lightning-fast.

417
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:29,221
He had an armor and flamethrowers.

418
00:32:32,471 --> 00:32:33,887
That's the man, right?

419
00:32:33,971 --> 00:32:34,928
Oh yes.

420
00:32:35,012 --> 00:32:37,762
One little hitch. He's a guy
from a fairy tale and he's immortal.

421
00:32:37,846 --> 00:32:38,970
Why is he so gloomy today?

422
00:32:39,054 --> 00:32:42,178
I'm gonna go to the evidence room
to break his life-protecting spell.

423
00:32:42,262 --> 00:32:43,928
We'll find the egg with the needle inside.

424
00:32:44,012 --> 00:32:45,387
We'll seal his swamp.

425
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:47,571
And we'll drag his cat in for questioning.

426
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:52,137
All the cases solved?

427
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,221
Go to your workstations.

428
00:32:59,387 --> 00:33:02,220
We've got a suspect. That's your Lyosha.

429
00:33:02,304 --> 00:33:05,179
Arrested in the vicinity
of the Grechkins' mansion.

430
00:33:05,804 --> 00:33:06,762
Where is he now?

431
00:33:07,387 --> 00:33:08,687
In the interrogation room.

432
00:33:15,054 --> 00:33:16,804
Don't leave your stuff unattended.

433
00:33:18,762 --> 00:33:20,428
Did the forensic experts find anything?

434
00:33:20,512 --> 00:33:22,928
Nada. Neither evidence nor fingerprints.

435
00:33:23,012 --> 00:33:24,554
Something new, right?

436
00:33:27,554 --> 00:33:29,220
-Where are you going?
-Excuse me.

437
00:33:29,304 --> 00:33:31,703
My name is Dima Dubin. I'm a trainee here.

438
00:33:31,787 --> 00:33:33,838
I made a sketch based
on your description.

439
00:33:33,922 --> 00:33:34,755
Let him in.

440
00:33:35,762 --> 00:33:37,512
-Let me see it.
-You have big ears, right?

441
00:33:37,596 --> 00:33:39,304
I heard your talk.

442
00:33:40,387 --> 00:33:41,554
Here you are.

443
00:33:43,012 --> 00:33:44,262
Okay.

444
00:33:50,346 --> 00:33:52,471
Do you need help? I'm ready.

445
00:33:53,929 --> 00:33:55,304
Too early for that. Got it?

446
00:33:56,512 --> 00:33:58,637
-Can you draw me?
-I can.

447
00:33:58,721 --> 00:34:00,137
Now, kiddo.

448
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:02,637
I know you didn't kill him.
I wanna help you.

449
00:34:04,804 --> 00:34:06,012
Somebody else helped me

450
00:34:07,096 --> 00:34:08,428
when he killed that moron.

451
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,862
You know anything about it?

452
00:34:11,804 --> 00:34:12,637
Yep.

453
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,054
The man who did it is a real hero.

454
00:34:25,054 --> 00:34:26,887
Igor. The kid doesn't have an alibi,

455
00:34:26,971 --> 00:34:29,421
but he's got a motive.
Can we close the case file?

456
00:34:30,221 --> 00:34:31,721
You'd better close your mouth.

457
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,803
A silent fool is counted wise.

458
00:34:33,887 --> 00:34:35,262
You wanna eat a pie or not?

459
00:34:51,387 --> 00:34:52,345
How to build a flamethrower

460
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:53,554
Search

461
00:35:04,762 --> 00:35:07,512
…a fancy costume
with a bone mask of a bird's skull…

462
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:09,554
Birds

463
00:35:17,471 --> 00:35:19,671
Hello. Were you
Kirill Grechkin's schoolmate?

464
00:35:20,512 --> 00:35:21,679
I wish he were dead.

465
00:35:22,304 --> 00:35:23,304
He is now.

466
00:35:46,762 --> 00:35:48,470
-I'll pay you the rest later.
-No worries. It's okay.

467
00:35:48,554 --> 00:35:50,012
…yet another controversy.

468
00:35:50,096 --> 00:35:52,137
Clouds of noxious fumes…

469
00:35:52,221 --> 00:35:54,179
Will you stop feeding the mutt?

470
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:56,678
It'll scare away all my customers.

471
00:35:56,762 --> 00:35:59,012
Nevertheless, Filipp Zilchenko
who owns the landfill,

472
00:35:59,096 --> 00:36:01,928
called the current ecological situation
normal,

473
00:36:02,012 --> 00:36:03,553
I quote, for a city

474
00:36:03,637 --> 00:36:04,971
built on a swamp.

475
00:36:05,929 --> 00:36:07,262
Help!

476
00:36:08,179 --> 00:36:10,304
-Please, don't!
-Come here!

477
00:36:11,012 --> 00:36:12,678
Relax or you'll make it worse!

478
00:36:12,762 --> 00:36:14,178
Please, let me go.

479
00:36:14,262 --> 00:36:16,803
First, we'll have a quickie.

480
00:36:16,887 --> 00:36:17,887
Please, don't.

481
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:19,762
Hey bitches!

482
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:21,971
Let the girl go!

483
00:36:23,012 --> 00:36:24,387
Or you wanna call the ambulance?

484
00:36:24,471 --> 00:36:25,679
You mean, the police?

485
00:36:26,596 --> 00:36:27,554
No.

486
00:36:28,471 --> 00:36:29,887
The police is already here.

487
00:36:29,971 --> 00:36:32,321
Hey you, hero.
You read too many comic strips…

488
00:36:34,804 --> 00:36:35,954
Can you hold it for me?

489
00:36:39,596 --> 00:36:40,554
You are a sicko!

490
00:36:50,137 --> 00:36:50,971
That's okay.

491
00:36:58,846 --> 00:37:00,887
I am lucky you are my neighbor.

492
00:37:08,554 --> 00:37:10,604
You don't have a lot of visitors, do you?

493
00:37:11,387 --> 00:37:12,221
Why?

494
00:37:13,637 --> 00:37:15,137
There's no door in the toilet.

495
00:37:16,096 --> 00:37:17,221
Right.

496
00:37:23,846 --> 00:37:25,179
How about a cup of tea?

497
00:37:25,721 --> 00:37:26,571
I'm okay, thanks.

498
00:37:32,637 --> 00:37:33,804
Yeah, I'll make one.

499
00:37:37,346 --> 00:37:38,387
Okay…

500
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,304
How about some tea?

501
00:37:46,346 --> 00:37:47,512
Or better pasta?

502
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:03,012
I am out of tea.

503
00:38:03,096 --> 00:38:04,762
I boiled you some water.

504
00:38:17,846 --> 00:38:20,178
The guy kicked your asses really hard.

505
00:38:20,262 --> 00:38:22,179
The schmuck nearly beat my face in.

506
00:38:23,846 --> 00:38:25,554
You look even better now.

507
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,887
Hey you!

508
00:38:28,971 --> 00:38:30,637
That was not our deal.

509
00:38:30,721 --> 00:38:33,512
Shell out another ten
for pain and suffering.

510
00:38:33,596 --> 00:38:34,678
Or else you'll be sorry.

511
00:38:34,762 --> 00:38:36,721
No worries, guys.

512
00:38:45,846 --> 00:38:46,971
Whatever you say.

513
00:38:48,846 --> 00:38:50,137
You're a sicko!

514
00:38:56,887 --> 00:38:57,970
Grechkin Jr

515
00:38:58,054 --> 00:39:01,704
You got what you deserved. RIP, scumbag.
You had it coming, damn rich boy.

516
00:39:26,304 --> 00:39:27,429
Can you feel it?

517
00:39:28,554 --> 00:39:29,554
The air is so fresh.

518
00:39:30,512 --> 00:39:32,304
The city got a bit cleaner now.

519
00:39:34,096 --> 00:39:36,012
-Was it you?
-Me.

520
00:39:37,721 --> 00:39:38,887
Do you understand

521
00:39:38,971 --> 00:39:40,304
what you did?

522
00:39:41,054 --> 00:39:42,012
Sure.

523
00:39:43,137 --> 00:39:44,804
I delivered justice.

524
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:47,596
Justice?

525
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:49,637
Kinda.

526
00:39:51,012 --> 00:39:51,928
By the way, I'm sorry.

527
00:39:52,012 --> 00:39:55,346
I spent a hell of a lot of your money
to develop this thing but…

528
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:58,221
I am kinda Batman now.

529
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:02,137
But no. Batman never kills.

530
00:40:02,971 --> 00:40:04,346
I am cooler than him.

531
00:40:08,179 --> 00:40:09,179
Oleg.

532
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:12,346
You killed a man.

533
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:31,012
What would you want me to do?

534
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:35,637
Visit Grechkin and put him in timeout?

535
00:40:36,512 --> 00:40:40,137
I'm the one who solves your problems.
In a hard and uncompromising way.

536
00:40:40,721 --> 00:40:43,971
You knew perfectly well
that I was going to kill him.

537
00:40:46,054 --> 00:40:47,554
But you never stopped me.

538
00:40:51,387 --> 00:40:53,971
Because you wanted him dead too.

539
00:40:58,221 --> 00:41:01,671
You know that these scumbags destroy
our city enjoying total impunity!

540
00:41:02,262 --> 00:41:04,346
And there's no other way to stop them!

541
00:41:05,721 --> 00:41:07,804
Don't be hysterical.

542
00:41:08,346 --> 00:41:09,646
And don't stand in my way.

543
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:15,012
Let the fun begin!

544
00:41:40,179 --> 00:41:41,479
Our city is seriously ill.

545
00:41:42,512 --> 00:41:45,345
It's struck by a plague of corruption,

546
00:41:45,429 --> 00:41:48,012
greed and lawlessness.

547
00:41:48,887 --> 00:41:52,137
The law enforcement system was powerless

548
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:54,137
to stop Kirill Grechkin.

549
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:55,804
But I did it.

550
00:41:56,679 --> 00:42:00,845
His death was my first act of justice.

551
00:42:00,929 --> 00:42:02,887
I will stop at nothing

552
00:42:02,971 --> 00:42:06,762
to burn the disease out.

553
00:42:06,846 --> 00:42:07,762
For I am

554
00:42:08,429 --> 00:42:10,262
the Plague Doctor.

555
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:13,304
Or do I sound too pretentious?

556
00:42:18,596 --> 00:42:22,345
Meet Olga Isayeva,

557
00:42:22,429 --> 00:42:25,012
the owner of Rosgarantbank.

558
00:42:25,637 --> 00:42:26,762
But wait,

559
00:42:27,262 --> 00:42:29,804
you know her perfectly well.

560
00:42:30,804 --> 00:42:31,762
Don't you?

561
00:42:32,762 --> 00:42:35,137
You were her clients,

562
00:42:35,221 --> 00:42:37,095
and Olga ripped you off.

563
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,345
She evicted you,

564
00:42:39,429 --> 00:42:41,512
seized your property

565
00:42:41,596 --> 00:42:43,971
and sent collectors after you.

566
00:42:45,054 --> 00:42:46,846
Did I forget anything?

567
00:42:47,554 --> 00:42:50,254
Son of a bitch!
You don't know who you're messing with!

568
00:42:50,971 --> 00:42:52,012
You're finished.

569
00:42:52,096 --> 00:42:53,512
No.

570
00:42:53,596 --> 00:42:55,928
It's you who is finished.

571
00:42:56,012 --> 00:42:59,304
Together with your rotten bank.

572
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:02,804
Tick tock.

573
00:43:03,304 --> 00:43:04,387
Clown!

574
00:43:04,471 --> 00:43:05,887
Who do you think you are?!

575
00:43:05,971 --> 00:43:08,220
I'm gonna destroy you!

576
00:43:08,304 --> 00:43:09,471
You're dead!

577
00:43:40,554 --> 00:43:43,262
That's all yours!

578
00:43:45,221 --> 00:43:48,928
Soon enough we'll have

579
00:43:49,012 --> 00:43:50,012
this city back.

580
00:43:55,012 --> 00:43:57,162
He's a sicko.
But these scumbags deserve it.

581
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,470
The entire city is baffled.

582
00:44:01,554 --> 00:44:04,345
A masked vigilante
who calls himself Plague Doctor

583
00:44:04,429 --> 00:44:06,637
declared war against men of influence

584
00:44:06,721 --> 00:44:09,137
enjoying massive public support online.

585
00:44:09,221 --> 00:44:13,554
His unprecedently violent video got
over ten million views.

586
00:44:14,054 --> 00:44:16,345
And his channel
in the Vmeste social network had

587
00:44:16,429 --> 00:44:18,220
more than a million subscribers

588
00:44:18,304 --> 00:44:21,137
even before the police arrived
at the crime scene.

589
00:44:25,637 --> 00:44:27,095
It's hardcore.

590
00:44:27,179 --> 00:44:29,720
You tell me. I almost
spewed when I saw it.

591
00:44:29,804 --> 00:44:32,012
What happened to that orphan?

592
00:44:32,096 --> 00:44:33,262
They let him go.

593
00:44:33,346 --> 00:44:35,137
We should've listened to what Grom said.

594
00:44:35,221 --> 00:44:37,470
-Chew some gum, willya?
-I don't wanna any gum.

595
00:44:37,554 --> 00:44:40,595
The Plague Doctor means new justice.

596
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:43,721
Shit, this psycho has got fans now.

597
00:44:47,721 --> 00:44:49,554
Gum! Give me some gum!

598
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:05,762
Who is he?

599
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:07,929
Meet Major Grom. I…

600
00:45:08,512 --> 00:45:09,596
I told you about him.

601
00:45:16,471 --> 00:45:17,928
Meet Yevgeniy Strelkov.

602
00:45:18,012 --> 00:45:19,596
He came all the way from Moscow

603
00:45:20,429 --> 00:45:22,803
to investigate the case
of the Plague Doctor.

604
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,928
Thanks, I don't need any help.

605
00:45:25,012 --> 00:45:26,562
They didn't tell you, did they?

606
00:45:27,554 --> 00:45:29,428
Really, it's a bit embarrassing.

607
00:45:29,512 --> 00:45:30,928
But it's my case now.

608
00:45:31,012 --> 00:45:32,553
I'd love to keep you in the team,

609
00:45:32,637 --> 00:45:33,721
but…

610
00:45:34,512 --> 00:45:36,762
I am afraid
my superiors would never agree.

611
00:45:37,387 --> 00:45:38,887
Sorry. I have my orders.

612
00:45:39,929 --> 00:45:41,845
Can I help you in any way?

613
00:45:41,929 --> 00:45:43,471
You sure can.

614
00:45:45,054 --> 00:45:47,454
Two cups of coffee with milk.
No sugar for Misha.

615
00:45:48,221 --> 00:45:49,470
Excuse me. Igor!

616
00:45:49,554 --> 00:45:51,428
Why didn't you tell me?

617
00:45:51,512 --> 00:45:53,095
You think I'm your secretary?

618
00:45:53,179 --> 00:45:55,303
-They told me this morning.
-But it's my case!

619
00:45:55,387 --> 00:45:56,637
Relax!

620
00:45:56,721 --> 00:45:58,720
Big bosses kept calling me
all the night through.

621
00:45:58,804 --> 00:46:01,762
They gave me so many orders that I could
hardly put in Yes, sir. Get lost!

622
00:46:01,846 --> 00:46:02,679
Just a few questions!

623
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:04,678
And now this asshole is here.

624
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:05,595
Wait!

625
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,053
Let's go to my place to have some borsch.

626
00:46:08,137 --> 00:46:10,096
I've got a super cool case for you.

627
00:46:10,762 --> 00:46:13,262
You'll never look back. You'll love it!

628
00:46:13,346 --> 00:46:15,221
Twelve fridges are gone?

629
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:16,678
How cool is that!

630
00:46:16,762 --> 00:46:18,928
No, I mean, that's a terrible crime.

631
00:46:19,012 --> 00:46:21,012
And we're investigating it together now.

632
00:46:21,096 --> 00:46:22,512
I never expected it.

633
00:46:23,137 --> 00:46:24,720
Just yesterday, sir, you…

634
00:46:24,804 --> 00:46:28,387
Or may I drop the formalities
now that we're partners?

635
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:30,637
I mean, Fyodor Ivanovich said that.

636
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:33,429
I am so happy they made me your partner.

637
00:46:34,804 --> 00:46:36,720
But really!

638
00:46:36,804 --> 00:46:39,137
Who could have broken in a huge warehouse

639
00:46:39,221 --> 00:46:40,720
to take nothing except fridges?

640
00:46:40,804 --> 00:46:43,137
Why not TV sets or laptops?

641
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:45,803
What if they had hijacked a truck?

642
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:47,220
That would make the case big.

643
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,178
Shit, I've got so many questions
but no answers.

644
00:46:49,262 --> 00:46:52,512
There's just one thing I'm sure about.
We must find and punish the thieves.

645
00:46:52,596 --> 00:46:54,804
We can't let them get away with it.

646
00:46:58,971 --> 00:46:59,804
Igor?

647
00:47:00,387 --> 00:47:01,346
Wait, Igor!

648
00:47:02,637 --> 00:47:03,637
Where are you going?

649
00:47:05,512 --> 00:47:09,762
I am asking the residents
of our city to stay calm.

650
00:47:09,846 --> 00:47:13,345
Let me assure you that we'll do our best
to detain the psycho

651
00:47:13,429 --> 00:47:15,803
and prosecute him
to the fullest extent of the law.

652
00:47:15,887 --> 00:47:17,346
Who investigates the case?

653
00:47:18,721 --> 00:47:20,221
They are the best men we have.

654
00:47:22,137 --> 00:47:24,054
Plague

655
00:47:32,471 --> 00:47:33,512
It stinks here!

656
00:47:34,054 --> 00:47:37,204
This landfill made the entire
neighborhood into a complete mess.

657
00:47:42,054 --> 00:47:43,504
Igor, what are we doing here?

658
00:47:45,971 --> 00:47:47,179
I'm looking for leads.

659
00:47:49,554 --> 00:47:51,762
No idea what you're doing here.

660
00:47:59,471 --> 00:48:01,470
Don't even think about telling them

661
00:48:01,554 --> 00:48:03,179
that you're a cop. Got it?

662
00:48:06,512 --> 00:48:08,137
Hey, what're you looking at?

663
00:48:08,971 --> 00:48:10,137
Hey you, come here!

664
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:17,804
Who's the squeaker?

665
00:48:21,554 --> 00:48:22,471
Hey guys.

666
00:48:33,054 --> 00:48:34,096
You wait here.

667
00:48:38,762 --> 00:48:42,262
The hell you doing, bro?
I spent half an hour building this shit.

668
00:48:42,346 --> 00:48:43,221
Hey man.

669
00:48:45,304 --> 00:48:47,404
-Some things never change, right?
-Come on.

670
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:50,387
What's buzzin'?

671
00:48:58,971 --> 00:49:01,371
What can you tell me
about the 12 stolen fridges?

672
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:03,887
No way, man.

673
00:49:03,971 --> 00:49:06,887
I'd never do any business
with such a dumbass.

674
00:49:06,971 --> 00:49:08,387
I'd never even sit down next to him.

675
00:49:08,471 --> 00:49:10,346
No idea who did it.

676
00:49:12,721 --> 00:49:13,720
But…

677
00:49:13,804 --> 00:49:16,678
I know a couple of dudes
who can probably help.

678
00:49:16,762 --> 00:49:19,387
I can give you a list if you want.

679
00:49:19,471 --> 00:49:20,637
Do me a favor, bro.

680
00:49:21,221 --> 00:49:24,929
Fuzz. You wanna nothing else
but free favors.

681
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:27,928
That doesn't work around here.

682
00:49:28,012 --> 00:49:29,512
Cut the bullshit.

683
00:49:30,054 --> 00:49:32,345
Before I ask you
where this dough is coming from.

684
00:49:32,429 --> 00:49:34,079
-Threatening me, bitch boy?
-Yeah.

685
00:49:34,637 --> 00:49:37,337
Do you want me to tell your mom
what you're doing here?

686
00:49:38,262 --> 00:49:39,595
Oh man!

687
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:41,928
Don't give me this bullshit, please!

688
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:43,512
-Don't do that.
-Come on.

689
00:49:43,596 --> 00:49:45,595
I'll make you a nice list right now.

690
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:47,762
-No mistakes.
-Sit tight!

691
00:49:47,846 --> 00:49:50,970
If you get to know anything
about the fridges, call me, okay?

692
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:52,345
I left my number here.

693
00:49:52,429 --> 00:49:53,596
Sure thing, bro.

694
00:49:54,137 --> 00:49:55,887
Seryoga. That's you, for real.

695
00:49:57,512 --> 00:49:58,470
Thanks, pals.

696
00:49:58,554 --> 00:50:00,428
Behave yourself.

697
00:50:00,512 --> 00:50:01,862
They're respectable people.

698
00:50:02,429 --> 00:50:03,346
I'm done.

699
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:13,929
You've got a piece of shit for the door.

700
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:15,970
Hey bitches!

701
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:17,387
I need information.

702
00:50:43,262 --> 00:50:44,096
Who is he?

703
00:50:44,721 --> 00:50:45,554
What?

704
00:50:46,179 --> 00:50:47,012
Tell me.

705
00:50:50,346 --> 00:50:52,137
I don't know.

706
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:53,512
Okay then.

707
00:50:55,221 --> 00:50:56,345
I don't know…

708
00:50:56,429 --> 00:50:57,678
I don't know…

709
00:50:57,762 --> 00:50:58,887
…anything.

710
00:50:58,971 --> 00:51:00,137
-Are you sure?
-Yes!

711
00:51:06,887 --> 00:51:07,804
Over there.

712
00:51:17,262 --> 00:51:19,137
Are you okay?

713
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:25,779
I can't believe we're investigating
the Plague Doctor together.

714
00:51:28,012 --> 00:51:29,137
Together… Vmeste…

715
00:51:31,637 --> 00:51:32,596
I'm an idiot.

716
00:51:36,429 --> 00:51:37,879
What are we going to do next?

717
00:51:44,304 --> 00:51:46,720
-You're going back to the station.
-Got it.

718
00:51:46,804 --> 00:51:48,220
-You write a report.
-Okay.

719
00:51:48,304 --> 00:51:50,553
On how we spent the whole day
looking for the fridges.

720
00:51:50,637 --> 00:51:52,437
-I wanna see it when I'm back.
-Okay.

721
00:52:06,887 --> 00:52:08,762
Sergey, you have a visitor.

722
00:52:09,762 --> 00:52:11,846
-I'm busy.
-A police officer.

723
00:52:13,554 --> 00:52:14,387
No kidding.

724
00:52:24,346 --> 00:52:25,846
Police Major Igor Grom.

725
00:52:26,721 --> 00:52:27,721
Hello.

726
00:52:30,429 --> 00:52:32,379
Would you like any tea, coffee or soda?

727
00:52:33,346 --> 00:52:34,346
Wow.

728
00:52:36,054 --> 00:52:37,471
Why is it that big?

729
00:52:40,012 --> 00:52:41,762
When I was a kid,

730
00:52:41,846 --> 00:52:45,137
I felt jealous about those who could
afford to buy these things.

731
00:52:46,637 --> 00:52:48,554
Closing my open Gestalt now.

732
00:52:49,637 --> 00:52:52,303
-Making up for the lost time?
-Kind of.

733
00:52:52,387 --> 00:52:53,346
Cool.

734
00:52:54,762 --> 00:52:57,178
I came to talk about the video
of the Plague Doctor.

735
00:52:57,262 --> 00:52:58,970
That's what I thought.

736
00:52:59,054 --> 00:53:01,053
I deleted the original one.

737
00:53:01,137 --> 00:53:04,762
But it made people post
more and more duplicates.

738
00:53:04,846 --> 00:53:07,262
Our algorithm prioritized this video

739
00:53:07,346 --> 00:53:09,678
-and shared it to the feeds…
-That's not why I came.

740
00:53:09,762 --> 00:53:13,012
I wanna find the owner of the smartphone
used to stream the video.

741
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:16,303
Decentralized encryption
makes it impossible

742
00:53:16,387 --> 00:53:18,804
to track down the users.

743
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:21,746
I am afraid
it's technologically unfeasible.

744
00:53:25,221 --> 00:53:28,303
Why build a system you can't control?

745
00:53:28,387 --> 00:53:31,304
Because freedom of expression is
a fundamental human right.

746
00:53:32,721 --> 00:53:34,929
You wanted
to promote freedom of expression.

747
00:53:35,429 --> 00:53:38,721
But instead you gave
a voice to a serial killer.

748
00:53:42,971 --> 00:53:44,262
And you…

749
00:53:45,512 --> 00:53:47,412
What have you got to do with the case?

750
00:53:49,012 --> 00:53:51,137
I mean, someone…

751
00:53:51,846 --> 00:53:55,595
Your smiley face colleague came here.
We already discussed it with him.

752
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:58,012
Yes, he asked me to fill in some dots.

753
00:54:01,387 --> 00:54:03,053
Don't worry, I won't report you.

754
00:54:03,137 --> 00:54:05,987
The more people investigate
the Plague Doctor, the better.

755
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:21,887
Who the hell are you,
big-nosed pterodactyl?

756
00:54:22,387 --> 00:54:24,887
Igor! Here is my report.
You wanted to see it.

757
00:54:26,971 --> 00:54:27,921
Get out of the way.

758
00:54:29,221 --> 00:54:30,571
I spent my whole day on it.

759
00:54:31,304 --> 00:54:33,345
And I found something.

760
00:54:33,429 --> 00:54:35,012
-Look on page four…
-Not now.

761
00:54:40,637 --> 00:54:42,262
Igor.

762
00:54:44,221 --> 00:54:46,054
Yulia Pchyolkina posted a new video.

763
00:54:46,721 --> 00:54:48,304
It's about the Plague Doctor.

764
00:54:49,096 --> 00:54:50,512
It may be useful.

765
00:54:53,221 --> 00:54:56,721
I got hold of the photos taken
at the Kirill Grechkin's murder site.

766
00:54:57,221 --> 00:54:59,095
He was the Plague Doctor's first victim.

767
00:54:59,179 --> 00:55:02,137
You can easily see
that the poor boy attempted to escape.

768
00:55:02,221 --> 00:55:06,220
But he suffered the fate of the bear
from a well-known joke.

769
00:55:06,304 --> 00:55:07,720
Say again. Who is she?

770
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,262
-You don't know Yulia Pchyolkina?
-No.

771
00:55:10,346 --> 00:55:13,553
She's a star. She investigates cases
and posts her videos.

772
00:55:13,637 --> 00:55:15,887
The police composite confirms the fact

773
00:55:15,971 --> 00:55:18,220
that cops knew about him
from the beginning.

774
00:55:18,304 --> 00:55:19,928
But they did nothing to stop the man.

775
00:55:20,012 --> 00:55:21,637
Look, this is my drawing.

776
00:55:22,304 --> 00:55:23,137
Cool!

777
00:55:24,304 --> 00:55:25,137
Wait a second.

778
00:55:25,762 --> 00:55:26,812
Where did she get it?

779
00:55:27,721 --> 00:55:29,220
And other documents too?

780
00:55:29,304 --> 00:55:31,262
Have we got a rat around here?

781
00:55:34,054 --> 00:55:36,887
Look. You don't have
any work to do, do you?

782
00:55:40,387 --> 00:55:43,387
First of all, we must find
the Plague Doctor. Right, partner?

783
00:55:44,137 --> 00:55:45,304
First of all,

784
00:55:47,262 --> 00:55:48,929
you must find the fridges.

785
00:55:49,762 --> 00:55:51,262
Freon. Search!

786
00:55:53,387 --> 00:55:55,178
I'm done for today.

787
00:55:55,262 --> 00:55:56,312
But you keep working.

788
00:55:56,929 --> 00:55:58,178
There.

789
00:55:58,262 --> 00:55:59,346
Have some coffee.

790
00:56:07,971 --> 00:56:10,929
A smile makes a dark day brighter

791
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:14,929
A smile can bring a rainbow to the sky

792
00:56:15,721 --> 00:56:18,179
Share your smile

793
00:56:19,179 --> 00:56:22,387
And it will often come back to you

794
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:26,595
And then all of a sudden
the clouds will start dancing

795
00:56:26,679 --> 00:56:29,887
And the grasshopper will start
playing the violin…

796
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:32,246
I thought you asked for some tea.

797
00:56:35,762 --> 00:56:37,554
Wanna tell me how you got in here?

798
00:56:38,804 --> 00:56:39,637
Nope.

799
00:56:42,346 --> 00:56:43,721
Wanna say you're sorry?

800
00:56:45,887 --> 00:56:46,721
No.

801
00:56:51,179 --> 00:56:53,012
We got off to a bad start.

802
00:56:56,637 --> 00:56:59,471
You know that your shenanigans could
cost me my job?

803
00:57:00,512 --> 00:57:01,596
Shit happens.

804
00:57:02,762 --> 00:57:04,137
Shit happens?

805
00:57:04,221 --> 00:57:05,137
Really?

806
00:57:05,762 --> 00:57:07,062
What do you want me to do?

807
00:57:08,721 --> 00:57:10,929
Kneel at your feet and beg for mercy?

808
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:14,721
It's every man for himself.

809
00:57:23,512 --> 00:57:24,471
Look, darling.

810
00:57:25,012 --> 00:57:26,862
You better think about yourself then.

811
00:57:27,429 --> 00:57:30,729
One more trick like this will turn
the star of Internet into a star

812
00:57:31,596 --> 00:57:32,796
of our detention center.

813
00:57:35,512 --> 00:57:36,803
Took you long to invent this one?

814
00:57:36,887 --> 00:57:38,221
Ten minutes or so.

815
00:57:41,137 --> 00:57:43,845
-While I was giving a bath to your laptop.
-What?

816
00:57:43,929 --> 00:57:45,387
It was too dirty.

817
00:57:46,054 --> 00:57:47,054
Meaning what?

818
00:57:56,679 --> 00:57:57,512
You motherf…

819
00:57:57,596 --> 00:58:01,387
A river begins with a blue stream

820
00:58:01,471 --> 00:58:04,929
And real friendship begins with a smile

821
00:58:20,137 --> 00:58:22,262
Fouling his own nest

822
00:58:24,512 --> 00:58:25,554
Meet

823
00:58:26,429 --> 00:58:28,304
Filipp Zilchenko.

824
00:58:29,054 --> 00:58:31,804
He has a waste
and recycling monopoly in the city.

825
00:58:33,429 --> 00:58:34,929
And here is

826
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:37,554
his masterpiece.

827
00:58:44,471 --> 00:58:47,428
Babies are born with defects.

828
00:58:47,512 --> 00:58:50,220
People suffer from terrible diseases.

829
00:58:50,304 --> 00:58:52,304
The city is suffocating

830
00:58:52,804 --> 00:58:54,679
because of…

831
00:58:56,429 --> 00:58:58,012
…this man here.

832
00:59:00,221 --> 00:59:01,137
I'm begging you.

833
00:59:01,221 --> 00:59:03,137
It's not my fault. Please!

834
00:59:03,221 --> 00:59:05,220
Spare my family! I…

835
00:59:05,304 --> 00:59:07,220
Your dump killed

836
00:59:07,304 --> 00:59:09,846
thousands of people.

837
00:59:10,471 --> 00:59:11,971
The same is going to happen

838
00:59:12,721 --> 00:59:14,971
to your family now.

839
00:59:16,221 --> 00:59:18,220
Let's make a deal!

840
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:19,179
No.

841
00:59:27,221 --> 00:59:29,053
The Plague Doctor committed

842
00:59:29,137 --> 00:59:30,470
another extremely brutal murder.

843
00:59:30,554 --> 00:59:34,137
The Plague Doctor…

844
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:35,928
He is a complete nutcase.

845
00:59:36,012 --> 00:59:37,220
Why kill the kid?

846
00:59:37,304 --> 00:59:40,678
A fighter for justice
or a megalomaniac and a sociopath?

847
00:59:40,762 --> 00:59:42,887
Criminals enjoy their total impunity.

848
00:59:42,971 --> 00:59:45,053
The people turn to rioting and looting.

849
00:59:45,137 --> 00:59:47,346
It's insane! What are you doing?!

850
00:59:50,804 --> 00:59:54,553
You can buy a mask like this one
in numerous online stores.

851
00:59:54,637 --> 00:59:56,553
It costs mere 99 rubles.

852
00:59:56,637 --> 00:59:57,595
Put a ban on it!

853
00:59:57,679 --> 01:00:00,220
Law enforcement agencies claim
they are doing their best

854
01:00:00,304 --> 01:00:02,262
but the crime rate is rising too fast.

855
01:00:02,346 --> 01:00:05,054
Sensible people know
that he crossed the line.

856
01:00:05,846 --> 01:00:06,928
No comment.

857
01:00:07,012 --> 01:00:09,095
It's embarrassing but we must admit

858
01:00:09,179 --> 01:00:11,329
that the serial killer
became a super star.

859
01:00:12,387 --> 01:00:14,346
You are… You are insane.

860
01:00:15,929 --> 01:00:17,729
Why did you kill the entire family?!

861
01:00:22,304 --> 01:00:24,054
You saw what's going on out there?!

862
01:00:26,304 --> 01:00:28,221
Oleg, these people are your followers!

863
01:00:32,721 --> 01:00:34,054
You must stop.

864
01:00:35,637 --> 01:00:37,137
Or else I'm going to stop you.

865
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,096
And what are you going to do?

866
01:00:46,221 --> 01:00:47,054
I…

867
01:00:50,054 --> 01:00:51,470
You'll be no longer supported.

868
01:00:51,554 --> 01:00:52,971
I'll switch off the servers!

869
01:00:55,596 --> 01:00:57,296
I'll shut down the social network.

870
01:01:02,137 --> 01:01:02,971
You mean…

871
01:01:04,596 --> 01:01:07,429
You want to give up
your lifetime project for…

872
01:01:08,471 --> 01:01:10,429
…for a handful of fat scumbags?

873
01:01:13,179 --> 01:01:17,096
Will that make the people's lives better?

874
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:20,512
Was that your dream?

875
01:01:26,137 --> 01:01:27,304
I'm calling the cops.

876
01:01:28,346 --> 01:01:31,429
Sergey, you want me
to call in emergency services?

877
01:01:44,429 --> 01:01:48,471
Don't forget to tell them you knew
about it from the very beginning.

878
01:01:56,054 --> 01:01:57,054
Oleg!

879
01:01:57,804 --> 01:01:58,845
Listen to me!

880
01:01:58,929 --> 01:01:59,928
I'm asking you…

881
01:02:00,012 --> 01:02:02,429
No, I'm begging you, you hear?!

882
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:04,887
You're gotta stop.

883
01:02:06,721 --> 01:02:07,846
No.

884
01:02:27,554 --> 01:02:28,721
Igor, are you in there?

885
01:02:31,512 --> 01:02:34,262
You didn't come to the station today.
Are you okay?

886
01:02:39,012 --> 01:02:39,929
Hi.

887
01:02:41,054 --> 01:02:42,754
They told me, you love this stuff.

888
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:48,054
Okay.

889
01:02:50,679 --> 01:02:52,137
You have five minutes.

890
01:02:52,221 --> 01:02:54,262
You know what the Plague Doctor did?

891
01:02:54,346 --> 01:02:55,846
The whole city is going crazy.

892
01:02:56,721 --> 01:02:57,771
We must get him asap.

893
01:02:58,304 --> 01:03:00,428
-Did you find the stolen fridges?
-I…

894
01:03:00,512 --> 01:03:02,012
I feel frozen out without you.

895
01:03:03,887 --> 01:03:06,187
Did you buy the sandwich
by the subway station?

896
01:03:08,346 --> 01:03:09,637
No potatoes next time.

897
01:03:13,054 --> 01:03:14,012
So stuffy in here.

898
01:03:14,637 --> 01:03:17,970
May I open the window? Oh, cool!

899
01:03:18,054 --> 01:03:20,904
Did you develop the criminal profile
of the Plague Doctor?

900
01:03:22,721 --> 01:03:25,271
They taught us how to do that
in the Police Academy.

901
01:03:25,846 --> 01:03:27,596
What type of a serial killer is he?

902
01:03:29,971 --> 01:03:31,928
Ah, he's mission-oriented.

903
01:03:32,012 --> 01:03:33,553
Pension-oriented…

904
01:03:33,637 --> 01:03:35,095
He pursues his ultimate goal

905
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:37,095
and kills for the sake of his ideals.

906
01:03:37,179 --> 01:03:38,346
But why make videos?

907
01:03:38,846 --> 01:03:40,387
Is it about sublimation?

908
01:03:40,471 --> 01:03:41,804
He wants attention.

909
01:03:42,387 --> 01:03:45,095
Video streaming helps him

910
01:03:45,179 --> 01:03:46,220
compensate for the lack of it.

911
01:03:46,304 --> 01:03:48,553
Yeah, childhood is the key
with these psychos.

912
01:03:48,637 --> 01:03:50,187
Probably he was a lonely child.

913
01:03:50,721 --> 01:03:52,512
Or an orphan. Look, Igor.

914
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:54,553
We need a list of…

915
01:03:54,637 --> 01:03:57,303
Forget about it.
We'll never identify the badass.

916
01:03:57,387 --> 01:03:59,595
We have no evidence.
We don't know his accomplices.

917
01:03:59,679 --> 01:04:02,095
We can only nail him at the crime scene.

918
01:04:02,179 --> 01:04:04,304
You analyzed the pattern.

919
01:04:05,096 --> 01:04:07,220
He's raising the stakes with every murder.

920
01:04:07,304 --> 01:04:08,637
Look at Grechkin.

921
01:04:08,721 --> 01:04:10,512
He destroyed the life of a single person.

922
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:12,220
Isayeva ripped off several hundreds.

923
01:04:12,304 --> 01:04:14,637
With Zilchenko we're talking
about thousands.

924
01:04:14,721 --> 01:04:17,012
That means that his next victim is someone

925
01:04:17,096 --> 01:04:19,512
everybody hates.

926
01:04:19,596 --> 01:04:20,996
You know who that person is?

927
01:04:22,679 --> 01:04:23,512
It's you.

928
01:04:26,637 --> 01:04:27,637
I don't know.

929
01:04:27,721 --> 01:04:30,021
There are too many
crazy moneybags in the city.

930
01:04:30,804 --> 01:04:33,904
If I were one of them, I would hide
in some underground bunker.

931
01:04:38,096 --> 01:04:38,970
Right.

932
01:04:39,054 --> 01:04:41,471
They open the Golden Dragon
casino tonight.

933
01:04:45,304 --> 01:04:48,554
Most of the people from the list
will be there. Look, Igor.

934
01:04:49,137 --> 01:04:50,096
Look.

935
01:04:50,596 --> 01:04:53,554
The Golden Dragon casino is opening
in Saint Petersburg.

936
01:04:56,596 --> 01:04:57,679
You're good.

937
01:05:00,804 --> 01:05:03,262
We should warn Strelkov now.

938
01:05:03,929 --> 01:05:05,054
Are you nuts?

939
01:05:05,596 --> 01:05:08,470
He'll arrive with a special op army.

940
01:05:08,554 --> 01:05:11,012
He'll scare away the Plague Doctor
and totally screw it up.

941
01:05:11,096 --> 01:05:13,720
Cool. Then it's the two of us, right?

942
01:05:13,804 --> 01:05:15,928
-Coz we're partners.
-The two of us?

943
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:17,678
We're no partners.

944
01:05:17,762 --> 01:05:18,637
Got it?

945
01:05:18,721 --> 01:05:19,762
Come on.

946
01:05:19,846 --> 01:05:22,137
We balance out the weak points
of each other.

947
01:05:24,012 --> 01:05:25,712
What are my weak points, I wonder?

948
01:05:26,512 --> 01:05:27,346
Well…

949
01:05:28,346 --> 01:05:30,012
Honestly speaking, you…

950
01:05:30,596 --> 01:05:31,896
You often break the rules.

951
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:35,854
You're in charge
of my professional development now?

952
01:05:36,887 --> 01:05:39,512
There are standard interrogation
and arrest procedures

953
01:05:39,596 --> 01:05:41,679
which we must follow.

954
01:05:47,471 --> 01:05:48,596
Look here.

955
01:05:49,929 --> 01:05:53,095
A masked sociopath armed with bombs
and flamethrowers is out there.

956
01:05:53,179 --> 01:05:55,529
Wanna try to catch him
following the procedures?

957
01:05:56,596 --> 01:06:00,053
He'll burn the city to the ground
before I prepare all the papers.

958
01:06:00,137 --> 01:06:04,804
If I follow the rules hunting bad guys,
I'll never get any of them. Know why?

959
01:06:06,179 --> 01:06:07,428
Because they follow no rules.

960
01:06:07,512 --> 01:06:09,512
What makes you different from them then?

961
01:06:10,762 --> 01:06:12,720
Yesterday you punched the guys
to get some info.

962
01:06:12,804 --> 01:06:14,845
What are you going to do tomorrow?

963
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:16,553
I'll kick the shit out of people again.

964
01:06:16,637 --> 01:06:18,803
You're crossing the line and you'll become

965
01:06:18,887 --> 01:06:21,554
-another criminal.
-I know my limits.

966
01:06:22,221 --> 01:06:23,887
I never kill anyone.

967
01:06:25,512 --> 01:06:26,387
One day you will.

968
01:06:26,471 --> 01:06:29,303
Okay. Get out. Your time is up.

969
01:06:29,387 --> 01:06:30,429
Go.

970
01:06:54,096 --> 01:06:56,220
Are you going to lose this cap or what?

971
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:58,254
Or are you a part-time taxi driver now?

972
01:07:00,179 --> 01:07:01,079
You got an invite?

973
01:07:01,887 --> 01:07:03,428
It was not easy at all.

974
01:07:03,512 --> 01:07:06,303
I didn't have to go to a sauna
with big shots

975
01:07:06,387 --> 01:07:07,987
but anyway it was quite a sweat.

976
01:07:10,721 --> 01:07:12,845
You don't think much of me, Grom.

977
01:07:12,929 --> 01:07:14,512
Come on, dude!

978
01:07:14,596 --> 01:07:16,178
If that was the case,

979
01:07:16,262 --> 01:07:19,178
you would've gone to jail a long time ago.
For the money shit you do.

980
01:07:19,262 --> 01:07:20,678
-Come on!
-Cool wheels!

981
01:07:20,762 --> 01:07:22,970
Sure thing. B means boosted.

982
01:07:23,054 --> 01:07:25,904
You know, someone hijacked
exactly the same one last week.

983
01:07:26,804 --> 01:07:28,262
-Really?
-Really.

984
01:07:28,346 --> 01:07:30,262
-No kidding?
-No kidding. The keys.

985
01:07:31,387 --> 01:07:33,470
-What d'ya mean?
-Give me the keys.

986
01:07:33,554 --> 01:07:34,454
Having a go at me?

987
01:07:43,429 --> 01:07:44,595
Can I have your keys?

988
01:07:44,679 --> 01:07:45,729
Take good care of it.

989
01:07:46,471 --> 01:07:47,921
And don't touch the flat cap.

990
01:07:48,554 --> 01:07:50,512
Hey man. You've got a cool car.

991
01:07:50,596 --> 01:07:53,296
I had a car like yours too.
They hijacked it last week.

992
01:07:54,387 --> 01:07:55,512
Case solved.

993
01:08:42,846 --> 01:08:45,553
Congratulations

994
01:08:45,637 --> 01:08:46,846
on the opening

995
01:08:47,387 --> 01:08:48,887
of my new casino -

996
01:08:49,929 --> 01:08:51,679
The Golden Dragon.

997
01:08:53,096 --> 01:08:55,387
I'd like to drink

998
01:08:56,137 --> 01:08:58,096
to everyone here.

999
01:08:59,054 --> 01:09:00,470
Because we are

1000
01:09:00,554 --> 01:09:03,845
cream of the crop in this city.

1001
01:09:03,929 --> 01:09:06,012
Here's to us! Hurrah!

1002
01:09:27,304 --> 01:09:29,137
Shanghai is not interesting.

1003
01:09:29,846 --> 01:09:31,221
Beijing is too provincial.

1004
01:09:31,846 --> 01:09:33,304
Saint Petersburg is the place

1005
01:09:33,846 --> 01:09:35,929
where we can do some serious stuff.

1006
01:09:36,637 --> 01:09:38,803
The city is at our feet, gentlemen.

1007
01:09:38,887 --> 01:09:41,304
-You again.
-Happy to see you too.

1008
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,720
-What's this?
-It's a bug.

1009
01:09:44,804 --> 01:09:46,704
Never seen these things? Give it back.

1010
01:09:47,429 --> 01:09:48,846
What are you doing here?

1011
01:09:50,721 --> 01:09:53,262
What can a reporter do
at a billionaires' party?

1012
01:09:53,762 --> 01:09:54,595
I don't know.

1013
01:09:54,679 --> 01:09:56,929
What is a policeman doing here?

1014
01:09:57,721 --> 01:09:59,179
Wearing a fancy suit?

1015
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:03,595
-You work undercover?
-Come on.

1016
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:04,887
Time to go home.

1017
01:10:07,846 --> 01:10:09,596
If you behave like an idiot

1018
01:10:10,304 --> 01:10:13,179
they'll kick both of us out. Got it?
Wanna dance?

1019
01:10:18,387 --> 01:10:19,587
May I ask you something?

1020
01:10:20,096 --> 01:10:21,678
About the Plague Doctor?

1021
01:10:21,762 --> 01:10:24,387
What do I think about him?
He's a murderer - plain and simple.

1022
01:10:24,471 --> 01:10:26,303
The people in the streets would not agree.

1023
01:10:26,387 --> 01:10:28,678
You know they call him a new Robin Hood?

1024
01:10:28,762 --> 01:10:32,345
I don't give a shit. I'm gonna shoot
the asshole down. End of story.

1025
01:10:32,429 --> 01:10:33,596
My turn now.

1026
01:10:38,846 --> 01:10:41,387
Why you have so many negative vibes
in your videos?

1027
01:10:42,262 --> 01:10:44,970
Why don't you show
true heroes of the city?

1028
01:10:45,054 --> 01:10:46,429
Who's that?

1029
01:10:51,012 --> 01:10:52,720
Razumovskiy, for example?

1030
01:10:52,804 --> 01:10:53,887
Razumovskiy?

1031
01:10:53,971 --> 01:10:55,012
He's not a hero.

1032
01:10:55,596 --> 01:10:57,345
The people in the streets would not agree.

1033
01:10:57,429 --> 01:10:58,721
The people in the streets

1034
01:10:59,346 --> 01:11:01,262
know nothing about his shady deals.

1035
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:06,021
His contract with HOLT International says
a lot about the man.

1036
01:11:11,304 --> 01:11:13,971
I'm gonna make you rich.

1037
01:11:17,304 --> 01:11:19,137
Sweetie, will you show them out?

1038
01:11:24,346 --> 01:11:25,221
Hi.

1039
01:11:26,554 --> 01:11:29,304
Look who's here!

1040
01:11:31,096 --> 01:11:32,928
Happy that you dropped in.

1041
01:11:33,012 --> 01:11:35,512
That was a great speech, Albert Adamovich.

1042
01:11:35,596 --> 01:11:38,971
Too bad you forgot to mention
how you got hold

1043
01:11:39,471 --> 01:11:42,095
of this fantastic place.

1044
01:11:42,179 --> 01:11:43,721
Everybody knows it.

1045
01:11:44,304 --> 01:11:47,262
They demolished this old shack
making the plot available.

1046
01:11:47,346 --> 01:11:50,178
What you called a shack

1047
01:11:50,262 --> 01:11:52,053
was a historic building.

1048
01:11:52,137 --> 01:11:54,762
Seryozha, don't start that again!

1049
01:11:55,512 --> 01:11:57,012
I got it all covered.

1050
01:11:58,137 --> 01:11:59,762
I've got all the papers.

1051
01:11:59,846 --> 01:12:01,762
The shack was not subject to…

1052
01:12:01,846 --> 01:12:03,471
-What you call it?
-Restoration.

1053
01:12:05,262 --> 01:12:06,428
Restoration.

1054
01:12:06,512 --> 01:12:07,845
Look around!

1055
01:12:07,929 --> 01:12:10,804
I know how you obtained the authorization.

1056
01:12:11,429 --> 01:12:12,637
Just think about it.

1057
01:12:13,512 --> 01:12:16,637
The building survived
the Bolshevik revolution,

1058
01:12:16,721 --> 01:12:17,762
and the Civil War

1059
01:12:18,762 --> 01:12:20,345
and the Siege.

1060
01:12:20,429 --> 01:12:22,387
But you and your casino are worse

1061
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:24,012
than any disaster.

1062
01:12:24,554 --> 01:12:27,637
-Can you give me a phone?
-HOLT… It rings a bell.

1063
01:12:28,304 --> 01:12:29,262
What's it?

1064
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:33,962
Nothing special. One of the largest weapon
manufacturers in the world.

1065
01:12:35,429 --> 01:12:36,596
Thank you.

1066
01:12:38,137 --> 01:12:40,596
You can trust me.
There're no heroes in this city.

1067
01:12:41,137 --> 01:12:43,287
I'll be the first to know
when we have one.

1068
01:12:44,387 --> 01:12:47,137
Year after year you profit off
ordinary people.

1069
01:12:47,221 --> 01:12:49,012
Remember this simple thing.

1070
01:12:50,137 --> 01:12:51,887
You won't need money when you die.

1071
01:12:51,971 --> 01:12:55,262
Think about that
when you count your billions.

1072
01:12:56,096 --> 01:12:57,196
Little son of a bitch.

1073
01:12:58,429 --> 01:13:00,303
I don't wanna dirty my hands.

1074
01:13:00,387 --> 01:13:01,887
Security!

1075
01:13:01,971 --> 01:13:04,137
Kick him out of here!

1076
01:13:12,012 --> 01:13:14,762
Well? You're done, bastards!

1077
01:13:14,846 --> 01:13:16,179
Let's rock'n'roll!

1078
01:13:16,887 --> 01:13:17,887
Take cover!

1079
01:13:25,762 --> 01:13:26,929
Screw it!

1080
01:13:29,387 --> 01:13:30,554
I must go there.

1081
01:13:33,429 --> 01:13:34,304
Dima.

1082
01:13:34,846 --> 01:13:36,096
Are you in a hurry?

1083
01:13:37,512 --> 01:13:38,471
Sit down.

1084
01:13:42,262 --> 01:13:45,762
Can you tell me about the investigation
you conduct together with Grom?

1085
01:13:46,346 --> 01:13:47,596
It's routine police work.

1086
01:13:48,137 --> 01:13:49,887
We look around and interview people

1087
01:13:50,637 --> 01:13:52,387
searching for the fridges.

1088
01:13:52,471 --> 01:13:53,471
Boring.

1089
01:13:54,304 --> 01:13:56,720
Dima, you're such a bad liar.

1090
01:13:56,804 --> 01:13:59,512
I know perfectly well that you and Grom

1091
01:13:59,596 --> 01:14:01,887
investigate the case of the Plague Doctor.

1092
01:14:01,971 --> 01:14:04,637
I'm sure that was not your idea.

1093
01:14:04,721 --> 01:14:05,928
You know,

1094
01:14:06,012 --> 01:14:08,387
what Major Grom does is illegal.

1095
01:14:08,471 --> 01:14:12,012
You help him to investigate the case.
And this is a crime too.

1096
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:15,096
Yevgeniy Borisovich,

1097
01:14:15,762 --> 01:14:17,012
are you interrogating me?

1098
01:14:22,971 --> 01:14:23,971
Listen, sucker.

1099
01:14:24,762 --> 01:14:26,312
I'm tired of being nice to you.

1100
01:14:27,804 --> 01:14:29,012
You've got two options.

1101
01:14:29,887 --> 01:14:33,512
You tell me everything
and I forget our little talk.

1102
01:14:34,096 --> 01:14:35,678
Or you keep telling me lies.

1103
01:14:35,762 --> 01:14:38,720
Then I'll make your life a true hell.

1104
01:14:38,804 --> 01:14:39,762
I can do it.

1105
01:14:40,762 --> 01:14:41,762
And I love doing it.

1106
01:14:44,554 --> 01:14:45,512
Well?

1107
01:14:59,429 --> 01:15:00,554
We struggle

1108
01:15:01,304 --> 01:15:04,554
to live off our meager salaries.

1109
01:15:05,221 --> 01:15:07,262
But you're in clover.

1110
01:15:07,346 --> 01:15:09,846
You pig out and have fun.

1111
01:15:10,887 --> 01:15:12,428
Now it's time

1112
01:15:12,512 --> 01:15:14,137
to pay the piper, right?

1113
01:15:15,262 --> 01:15:17,262
Excuse me!

1114
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:18,220
Please!

1115
01:15:18,304 --> 01:15:20,221
-Hear me out!
-Let him talk.

1116
01:15:22,596 --> 01:15:24,512
I know why you are here.

1117
01:15:24,596 --> 01:15:26,345
But violence is not a solution.

1118
01:15:26,429 --> 01:15:27,429
What do you want?

1119
01:15:28,387 --> 01:15:30,303
You want money? We'll give you money.

1120
01:15:30,387 --> 01:15:32,762
Let's try to negotiate a deal.

1121
01:15:32,846 --> 01:15:35,303
-Wanna earn some money?
-My name is Sergey.

1122
01:15:35,387 --> 01:15:36,596
Sergey Razumovskiy.

1123
01:15:39,221 --> 01:15:41,096
The Sergey Razumovskiy.

1124
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:44,137
We're lucky, right, dudes?

1125
01:15:51,387 --> 01:15:53,387
Tell me, Sergey Razumovskiy.

1126
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,345
You wanna bribe us?

1127
01:15:55,429 --> 01:15:56,554
You know what?

1128
01:15:57,054 --> 01:15:59,096
We're gonna take it all anyway!

1129
01:16:03,512 --> 01:16:04,970
Who did it?!

1130
01:16:05,054 --> 01:16:06,929
Think!

1131
01:16:07,846 --> 01:16:08,803
Get him!

1132
01:16:08,887 --> 01:16:09,887
No time to think.

1133
01:16:11,429 --> 01:16:12,637
Finish him off!

1134
01:16:14,887 --> 01:16:16,678
What are you waiting for? Go!

1135
01:16:16,762 --> 01:16:17,637
Get him!

1136
01:16:52,471 --> 01:16:53,346
You!

1137
01:17:06,721 --> 01:17:08,429
Wanna play a hero?

1138
01:17:09,054 --> 01:17:10,096
Chill out, will ya?

1139
01:17:23,096 --> 01:17:24,262
Hands up in the air!

1140
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,554
We're in!

1141
01:17:32,804 --> 01:17:33,904
Let's get out of here!

1142
01:17:34,587 --> 01:17:36,837
Hands up! Drop to the floor!

1143
01:17:37,671 --> 01:17:39,212
Sector One clear!

1144
01:17:39,296 --> 01:17:40,129
Face the floor!

1145
01:17:40,213 --> 01:17:42,363
Hands on the back of
your head! Legs apart!

1146
01:17:43,087 --> 01:17:44,637
-Face the floor!
-Don't look up!

1147
01:17:52,254 --> 01:17:53,337
Those were copycats.

1148
01:17:54,171 --> 01:17:55,878
Several of them escaped.

1149
01:17:55,962 --> 01:17:57,004
We got the rest.

1150
01:17:58,004 --> 01:17:58,879
Good job.

1151
01:18:01,671 --> 01:18:02,721
Take them to the van!

1152
01:18:08,337 --> 01:18:09,546
You saved my life.

1153
01:18:10,671 --> 01:18:11,879
I wanted to thank you.

1154
01:18:13,171 --> 01:18:14,087
No big deal.

1155
01:18:16,046 --> 01:18:18,754
You rock, dude! You're a real man.

1156
01:18:26,504 --> 01:18:27,421
Igor!

1157
01:18:28,546 --> 01:18:30,379
If you need anything,

1158
01:18:31,087 --> 01:18:32,212
I'll be happy to help.

1159
01:18:41,087 --> 01:18:42,545
I'm absolutely sure

1160
01:18:42,629 --> 01:18:44,670
that it's the impact of social media.

1161
01:18:44,754 --> 01:18:45,796
Talk to the girl.

1162
01:18:48,879 --> 01:18:50,795
Miss, you can't film here.

1163
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:51,712
I'm a reporter.

1164
01:18:51,797 --> 01:18:53,130
That was good timing.

1165
01:18:54,046 --> 01:18:55,796
Well? How are we doing?

1166
01:18:56,379 --> 01:18:57,587
Everything is under control?

1167
01:18:57,671 --> 01:18:58,671
We're doing great.

1168
01:18:59,462 --> 01:19:00,337
You aren't.

1169
01:19:01,546 --> 01:19:03,337
-Why's that?
-Just because.

1170
01:19:09,129 --> 01:19:10,087
You're fired.

1171
01:19:15,671 --> 01:19:16,629
Igor!

1172
01:19:18,004 --> 01:19:19,712
That was awesome! Simply…

1173
01:19:20,337 --> 01:19:23,037
…wow! I filmed it all.
Can you say a couple of words?

1174
01:19:24,046 --> 01:19:25,587
-Can you give it to me?
-Okay?

1175
01:19:40,212 --> 01:19:42,420
…obstructing justice,

1176
01:19:42,504 --> 01:19:45,670
negligence in danger assessment,

1177
01:19:45,754 --> 01:19:47,753
excess of authority…

1178
01:19:47,837 --> 01:19:50,671
Your partner threw you under the bus. Now.

1179
01:19:52,421 --> 01:19:54,837
Either you kick him out

1180
01:19:54,921 --> 01:19:57,221
or I'll send this file
up the chain of command.

1181
01:19:58,004 --> 01:19:59,962
-You…
-Fyodor Ivanovich!

1182
01:20:00,504 --> 01:20:01,546
Take it easy.

1183
01:20:05,004 --> 01:20:05,837
What are you…

1184
01:20:06,587 --> 01:20:07,546
I quit the job.

1185
01:20:17,962 --> 01:20:19,045
No.

1186
01:20:19,129 --> 01:20:20,129
That's okay.

1187
01:20:21,171 --> 01:20:22,046
No.

1188
01:20:24,629 --> 01:20:25,462
Igor.

1189
01:20:30,129 --> 01:20:31,504
Good boy.

1190
01:21:12,337 --> 01:21:13,837
Partner.

1191
01:21:14,587 --> 01:21:15,587
Igor, I…

1192
01:21:27,546 --> 01:21:29,096
The train's moving really fast.

1193
01:21:30,212 --> 01:21:31,671
I'm lying on the roof.

1194
01:21:32,962 --> 01:21:34,812
The blood is gushing out of my wound.

1195
01:21:35,879 --> 01:21:38,045
The wind is blowing snow in my face.

1196
01:21:38,129 --> 01:21:39,004
And I'm thinking:

1197
01:21:39,504 --> 01:21:40,704
I should buy a neckband.

1198
01:21:47,671 --> 01:21:48,771
We can't wake Lena up.

1199
01:21:51,129 --> 01:21:51,962
Igor.

1200
01:21:53,796 --> 01:21:55,846
Aren't you sick and tired of being alone?

1201
01:21:59,671 --> 01:22:01,421
Why would I want anyone by my side?

1202
01:22:02,671 --> 01:22:03,712
I feel great alone.

1203
01:22:05,504 --> 01:22:08,046
You don't trust anyone, do you, Igor?

1204
01:22:09,254 --> 01:22:10,753
I was exactly the same.

1205
01:22:10,837 --> 01:22:12,212
I never trusted anyone.

1206
01:22:12,296 --> 01:22:14,896
Why trust people?
They'll sell you out anyway, right?

1207
01:22:19,087 --> 01:22:20,087
But then, Igor,

1208
01:22:20,171 --> 01:22:21,296
I met your dad.

1209
01:22:22,754 --> 01:22:23,753
And then I met Lena.

1210
01:22:23,837 --> 01:22:26,462
My whole life turned upside down, got it?

1211
01:22:27,171 --> 01:22:29,628
When you know that behind your back

1212
01:22:29,712 --> 01:22:32,162
you've got your family,
your friend and your wife,

1213
01:22:33,171 --> 01:22:35,253
you get a superpower.

1214
01:22:35,337 --> 01:22:39,004
You can move heaven and earth.
The second wind kicks in.

1215
01:22:41,379 --> 01:22:42,921
Don't push people away, Igor.

1216
01:22:45,254 --> 01:22:46,504
They'll give you power.

1217
01:23:07,004 --> 01:23:08,128
What do you want?

1218
01:23:08,212 --> 01:23:10,962
-Hi Yulia.
-Wanna break my TV now? Do it.

1219
01:23:15,337 --> 01:23:16,171
I…

1220
01:23:16,712 --> 01:23:18,062
I mean I freaked out there.

1221
01:23:19,546 --> 01:23:20,379
That's for you.

1222
01:23:22,796 --> 01:23:24,421
It costs your monthly salary.

1223
01:23:25,796 --> 01:23:28,337
Next month I'll buy you a laptop, promise.

1224
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:29,754
Take it.

1225
01:23:31,004 --> 01:23:32,337
I have to go.

1226
01:23:38,462 --> 01:23:41,171
Forgive me for everything I did.
I didn't mean it.

1227
01:23:42,629 --> 01:23:43,462
Promise.

1228
01:24:09,212 --> 01:24:10,879
Trainee.

1229
01:24:18,337 --> 01:24:19,171
Ilya!

1230
01:24:40,629 --> 01:24:42,087
-Hello.
-Hello.

1231
01:24:43,129 --> 01:24:44,546
Good you called me, Igor.

1232
01:24:45,212 --> 01:24:48,670
I am really worried about Lyosha.
He's been away for two days now.

1233
01:24:48,754 --> 01:24:50,879
-I have a feeling that he…
-Yes, I know.

1234
01:24:51,712 --> 01:24:53,796
Can I see his room?

1235
01:24:56,337 --> 01:24:58,087
Sure. No problem.

1236
01:24:58,171 --> 01:25:01,129
-It's a nice place.
-Yes, Sergey Razumovskiy helps us a lot.

1237
01:25:01,712 --> 01:25:03,628
He sponsored the restoration
of the building.

1238
01:25:03,712 --> 01:25:05,712
He donates money and gifts for the kids.

1239
01:25:06,296 --> 01:25:07,670
He grew up in this children's home.

1240
01:25:07,754 --> 01:25:08,954
This is why he helps us.

1241
01:25:09,837 --> 01:25:11,004
God bless him.

1242
01:25:11,587 --> 01:25:13,787
We kept some things
from his childhood years.

1243
01:25:14,421 --> 01:25:15,879
Who is this man by his side?

1244
01:25:16,546 --> 01:25:19,045
Oleg Volkov was his only friend.

1245
01:25:19,129 --> 01:25:22,479
They became best friends right
after he came to the children's home.

1246
01:25:24,254 --> 01:25:26,254
Later Sergey went to study in a college,

1247
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:28,504
and Oleg served in the army.

1248
01:25:31,129 --> 01:25:33,421
-May I take a look?
-Yes, sure.

1249
01:25:39,046 --> 01:25:41,046
Sergey was all alone before he met Oleg.

1250
01:25:42,171 --> 01:25:43,629
He always played on his own.

1251
01:25:44,921 --> 01:25:47,378
And he often made sketches
in his notebooks.

1252
01:25:47,462 --> 01:25:49,421
He's got an artistic personality.

1253
01:25:59,379 --> 01:26:00,837
He pursues his ultimate goal

1254
01:26:00,921 --> 01:26:02,462
and kills for the sake of his ideals.

1255
01:26:02,546 --> 01:26:04,096
Probably he was a lonely child.

1256
01:26:04,754 --> 01:26:07,087
When I was a kid
I felt jealous about those…

1257
01:26:07,171 --> 01:26:09,962
The Plague Doctor's channel
in the Vmeste social network…

1258
01:26:10,046 --> 01:26:11,087
-Vmeste…
-Mission-oriented…

1259
01:26:11,171 --> 01:26:12,253
God bless him.

1260
01:26:12,337 --> 01:26:14,128
The man who did it is a real hero.

1261
01:26:14,212 --> 01:26:15,670
Razumovskiy?

1262
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:16,837
He's not a hero.

1263
01:26:16,921 --> 01:26:19,587
His contract with HOLT International says
a lot about the man.

1264
01:26:19,671 --> 01:26:21,045
And Oleg served in the army.

1265
01:26:21,129 --> 01:26:23,628
One of the largest weapon
manufacturers in the world.

1266
01:26:23,712 --> 01:26:24,879
Vmeste…

1267
01:26:28,462 --> 01:26:30,629
Thanks for finding some time for me.

1268
01:26:34,212 --> 01:26:35,587
Sure, Igor.

1269
01:26:35,671 --> 01:26:38,046
-You saved me out there.
-That was no big deal.

1270
01:26:38,629 --> 01:26:40,587
-Are you okay if we drop the formalities?
-Sure.

1271
01:26:40,671 --> 01:26:41,837
Come on in.

1272
01:26:41,921 --> 01:26:43,379
Sorry about the mess.

1273
01:26:44,629 --> 01:26:46,296
Do you really live here?

1274
01:26:47,462 --> 01:26:48,296
Yep.

1275
01:26:48,921 --> 01:26:52,253
I try to make the most of my time.

1276
01:26:52,337 --> 01:26:53,787
Without losing it in traffic.

1277
01:26:55,171 --> 01:26:56,071
How about a drink?

1278
01:26:57,671 --> 01:26:59,371
No, thanks. I can't drink on duty.

1279
01:27:00,671 --> 01:27:03,212
That's a cool place.
With all these sculptures…

1280
01:27:05,712 --> 01:27:06,879
Venus is beautiful.

1281
01:27:07,421 --> 01:27:08,971
The original painting, I guess?

1282
01:27:09,837 --> 01:27:10,671
No, thanks.

1283
01:27:14,504 --> 01:27:15,546
Tell me something.

1284
01:27:16,087 --> 01:27:18,712
What is more expensive: all of this

1285
01:27:19,962 --> 01:27:21,962
or a single outfit of the Plague Doctor?

1286
01:27:25,671 --> 01:27:26,504
I don't know.

1287
01:27:26,588 --> 01:27:27,713
Come on.

1288
01:27:28,712 --> 01:27:31,128
That's your contract
with HOLT International.

1289
01:27:31,212 --> 01:27:32,046
Take a look.

1290
01:27:34,087 --> 01:27:36,087
The Description of Services says

1291
01:27:36,171 --> 01:27:38,420
something about updating
office security systems.

1292
01:27:38,504 --> 01:27:40,295
And I wondered.

1293
01:27:40,379 --> 01:27:43,045
Why would a foreign manufacturer

1294
01:27:43,129 --> 01:27:46,587
of the most advanced weapons install
alarm systems in your office?

1295
01:27:46,671 --> 01:27:49,128
And here are the drawings
you made as a kid.

1296
01:27:49,212 --> 01:27:50,046
Look at them.

1297
01:27:55,046 --> 01:27:56,337
Rings a bell?

1298
01:28:01,587 --> 01:28:03,295
And now tell me, scumbag,

1299
01:28:03,379 --> 01:28:05,753
why you killed all those people.

1300
01:28:05,837 --> 01:28:06,879
It was not me.

1301
01:28:07,504 --> 01:28:09,154
Who did it then? I want the name.

1302
01:28:11,587 --> 01:28:12,421
Oleg?

1303
01:28:18,754 --> 01:28:19,837
Funny.

1304
01:28:19,921 --> 01:28:23,296
First I thought the same.
That your friend Oleg Volkov did it.

1305
01:28:25,087 --> 01:28:28,337
But then I found out
that he was killed in Syria last year.

1306
01:28:32,254 --> 01:28:33,378
No more bullshit.

1307
01:28:33,462 --> 01:28:36,337
Either you give me all the details…

1308
01:28:36,421 --> 01:28:37,421
Look me in the eyes!

1309
01:28:38,046 --> 01:28:39,962
…or I'll make you talk.

1310
01:28:40,629 --> 01:28:41,829
What are you looking at?

1311
01:28:53,379 --> 01:28:56,253
I didn't think you'll ever do it.

1312
01:28:56,337 --> 01:28:57,962
-Oleg.
-Enough.

1313
01:28:58,712 --> 01:29:00,671
Oleg is not here.

1314
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:03,337
And he has never been around.

1315
01:29:04,087 --> 01:29:06,128
You know it perfectly well.

1316
01:29:06,212 --> 01:29:09,295
It has always been me.

1317
01:29:09,379 --> 01:29:12,879
All the time.

1318
01:29:18,087 --> 01:29:18,921
Hi.

1319
01:29:20,504 --> 01:29:21,379
What's your name?

1320
01:29:22,087 --> 01:29:23,087
Seryozha.

1321
01:29:24,671 --> 01:29:26,462
I'm Uncle Kostya.

1322
01:29:29,837 --> 01:29:31,004
How old are you?

1323
01:29:33,337 --> 01:29:34,879
-I'm eight.
-Wow.

1324
01:29:36,879 --> 01:29:38,462
My son is a bit older than you.

1325
01:29:40,629 --> 01:29:42,171
There was a fire nearby.

1326
01:29:43,337 --> 01:29:44,879
Get out of here, dork.

1327
01:29:45,421 --> 01:29:46,571
Three boys were killed.

1328
01:29:48,462 --> 01:29:49,587
Did you see it?

1329
01:29:58,921 --> 01:30:00,003
No.

1330
01:30:00,087 --> 01:30:02,795
You were alone. That's why I came around.

1331
01:30:02,879 --> 01:30:04,379
I've always been by your side.

1332
01:30:05,087 --> 01:30:06,712
I protected you.

1333
01:30:06,796 --> 01:30:09,396
We lived in perfect harmony, buddy.
What's wrong now?

1334
01:30:10,796 --> 01:30:12,170
I see.

1335
01:30:12,254 --> 01:30:14,004
You found a real friend.

1336
01:30:14,546 --> 01:30:15,746
And you forgot about me.

1337
01:30:16,462 --> 01:30:17,562
But I never went away.

1338
01:30:18,962 --> 01:30:21,212
I always lived

1339
01:30:21,296 --> 01:30:24,087
inside your head. Now,

1340
01:30:24,171 --> 01:30:25,254
that Oleg is gone,

1341
01:30:26,712 --> 01:30:27,879
I am back.

1342
01:30:29,129 --> 01:30:30,837
Look at what we did together.

1343
01:30:30,921 --> 01:30:32,295
You killed all those people.

1344
01:30:32,379 --> 01:30:33,754
We killed them together.

1345
01:30:34,546 --> 01:30:36,254
What's wrong about it?

1346
01:30:37,504 --> 01:30:40,253
You wanted to make
the city a better place.

1347
01:30:40,337 --> 01:30:41,487
But I'm not a murderer!

1348
01:30:44,129 --> 01:30:46,837
You hated the kids who bullied you
in the orphanage,

1349
01:30:46,921 --> 01:30:48,712
the bad guys who wanted
to grab your business,

1350
01:30:48,796 --> 01:30:51,087
rich dudes who poison our city!

1351
01:30:51,171 --> 01:30:53,128
I remember everyone who made you suffer.

1352
01:30:53,212 --> 01:30:54,628
God is my witness,

1353
01:30:54,712 --> 01:30:56,504
I was patient for far too long.

1354
01:30:58,254 --> 01:30:59,712
Time has come.

1355
01:30:59,796 --> 01:31:01,170
You're my creation.

1356
01:31:01,254 --> 01:31:03,170
If I want it really bad,
you will disappear.

1357
01:31:03,254 --> 01:31:06,379
Go away.

1358
01:31:15,421 --> 01:31:17,962
That was a nice try.

1359
01:31:18,879 --> 01:31:21,212
I'm not your imaginary companion.

1360
01:31:21,296 --> 01:31:22,296
You see.

1361
01:31:23,546 --> 01:31:26,754
I helped you kill the people before.

1362
01:31:27,254 --> 01:31:28,129
But

1363
01:31:30,046 --> 01:31:31,296
this time

1364
01:31:38,296 --> 01:31:41,379
you did it yourself.

1365
01:31:41,921 --> 01:31:43,921
That means something.

1366
01:31:46,629 --> 01:31:49,254
We're becoming one.

1367
01:31:57,546 --> 01:31:59,962
I'm gonna kill myself!
I'm gonna kill both of us!

1368
01:32:00,046 --> 01:32:02,296
Don't even think about it, sucker.

1369
01:32:03,129 --> 01:32:04,754
I'll never let you ruin my plan.

1370
01:32:05,921 --> 01:32:07,087
You're gonna like it.

1371
01:32:07,171 --> 01:32:09,671
You'll see it come true
with your own eyes!

1372
01:33:16,046 --> 01:33:18,462
The Golden Dragon Casino.

1373
01:33:19,629 --> 01:33:23,296
Yesterday they had a feast
in the time of plague there.

1374
01:33:23,837 --> 01:33:28,004
Today it's ablaze with its owner inside.

1375
01:33:29,212 --> 01:33:33,962
Albert Bekhtiev bartered away his native
city and worshiped the golden calf.

1376
01:33:34,587 --> 01:33:37,046
He paid for it with his own life.

1377
01:33:37,921 --> 01:33:40,920
The same fate awaits all the moneybags

1378
01:33:41,004 --> 01:33:43,129
who dared to break the law.

1379
01:34:01,879 --> 01:34:04,379
Oh shit…

1380
01:34:21,671 --> 01:34:23,087
Surrender!

1381
01:34:23,171 --> 01:34:25,504
Resistance is futile. You're surrounded.

1382
01:34:28,212 --> 01:34:31,004
I repeat, resistance is futile.

1383
01:34:37,837 --> 01:34:39,712
Come down here. Let's talk.

1384
01:34:41,796 --> 01:34:42,629
Freeze!

1385
01:35:01,212 --> 01:35:02,462
Keep your hands down!

1386
01:35:16,296 --> 01:35:18,421
Yevgeniy Borisovich, we lost him.

1387
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:03,504
Central, I think I got the Plague Doctor.

1388
01:36:06,587 --> 01:36:07,887
It's gonna blow Igor away.

1389
01:36:11,671 --> 01:36:13,321
Razumovskiy is the Plague Doctor?

1390
01:36:15,462 --> 01:36:18,128
-Yes.
-That's bullshit!

1391
01:36:18,212 --> 01:36:21,629
You check out the evidence
I got against him!

1392
01:36:23,671 --> 01:36:25,571
-You mean his childhood drawings?
-Yes.

1393
01:36:26,796 --> 01:36:27,712
Darling.

1394
01:36:27,796 --> 01:36:30,587
We got you in the act at the crime scene.

1395
01:36:32,812 --> 01:36:37,103
Last night the criminal disguised
as Plague Doctor was arrested.

1396
01:36:37,187 --> 01:36:39,387
His true identity has not been
disclosed yet.

1397
01:36:59,271 --> 01:37:00,812
-Three o'clock?
-Clear.

1398
01:37:00,896 --> 01:37:02,646
-Clear at Nine.
-Clear at Twelve.

1399
01:37:45,812 --> 01:37:47,478
We won't let you do it!

1400
01:37:47,562 --> 01:37:49,603
We'll never forgive!

1401
01:37:49,687 --> 01:37:52,062
Free the Plague Doctor!

1402
01:37:53,437 --> 01:37:56,312
Free the Plague Doctor!

1403
01:37:56,396 --> 01:37:58,437
Free the Plague Doctor!

1404
01:38:34,396 --> 01:38:35,312
I do judo.

1405
01:39:01,729 --> 01:39:03,437
I'm not asking to help me. I…

1406
01:39:03,979 --> 01:39:05,687
You have to understand. You promised.

1407
01:39:05,771 --> 01:39:08,354
-I remember you said…
-Fyodor Ivanovich?

1408
01:39:09,062 --> 01:39:10,395
I came to say goodbye.

1409
01:39:10,479 --> 01:39:11,604
I got you. Yes sir.

1410
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:14,979
-I…
-Do you know what's going on out there?

1411
01:39:30,437 --> 01:39:31,437
Your lawyer is here.

1412
01:39:45,687 --> 01:39:47,537
When did you become a defense lawyer?

1413
01:39:49,146 --> 01:39:50,696
You really wanna talk about it?

1414
01:39:53,104 --> 01:39:53,954
What do you want?

1415
01:39:54,604 --> 01:39:56,021
Another exclusive story?

1416
01:39:57,604 --> 01:39:59,145
I wanna help you.

1417
01:39:59,229 --> 01:40:00,854
I'm sure you were framed up.

1418
01:40:01,896 --> 01:40:02,771
Why is that?

1419
01:40:04,562 --> 01:40:08,112
They would've never caught the Plague
Doctor that easily. He's no idiot.

1420
01:40:09,521 --> 01:40:10,521
Well…

1421
01:40:11,979 --> 01:40:14,645
-I almost started to like you.
-Igor.

1422
01:40:14,729 --> 01:40:17,728
Can you stop being a stubborn mule
for a second? Admit it.

1423
01:40:17,812 --> 01:40:19,645
I'm your only hope.

1424
01:40:19,729 --> 01:40:21,062
Tell me what happened.

1425
01:40:21,146 --> 01:40:23,353
I'll make it public
and they'll let you go.

1426
01:40:23,437 --> 01:40:24,937
I don't have that much time.

1427
01:40:25,021 --> 01:40:27,021
I must get out of here now.

1428
01:40:28,646 --> 01:40:30,396
First, I nail the Plague Doctor,

1429
01:40:32,854 --> 01:40:34,104
then we'll talk.

1430
01:40:43,646 --> 01:40:44,496
Whatever you say.

1431
01:40:48,854 --> 01:40:50,354
Don't leave your trash behind.

1432
01:40:56,729 --> 01:40:57,853
Yevgeniy Borisovich!

1433
01:40:57,937 --> 01:40:59,978
-Igor is innocent.
-The judge will get to the truth.

1434
01:41:00,062 --> 01:41:01,812
-But you said…
-Moscow calling.

1435
01:41:01,896 --> 01:41:04,354
Dmitriy. You're starting to annoy me.

1436
01:41:05,021 --> 01:41:07,853
-Did I make myself clear?
-Yevgeniy Borisovich, he couldn't do that.

1437
01:41:07,937 --> 01:41:08,896
Hello?

1438
01:41:09,896 --> 01:41:11,646
A hitman with a rat?

1439
01:41:12,396 --> 01:41:14,596
-What is this bullshit?
-Yevgeniy Borisovich!

1440
01:41:15,854 --> 01:41:17,271
-Okay.
-Yevgeniy Borisovich!

1441
01:41:37,187 --> 01:41:38,771
True master never fades away.

1442
01:41:47,896 --> 01:41:49,096
You've got five minutes.

1443
01:41:50,229 --> 01:41:51,329
I want your taser too.

1444
01:41:57,687 --> 01:41:59,229
How can you wear this shit?

1445
01:42:05,479 --> 01:42:06,687
-Hey dude…
-Igor!

1446
01:42:08,437 --> 01:42:09,587
What is she doing here?

1447
01:42:10,562 --> 01:42:11,395
What do you mean?

1448
01:42:11,479 --> 01:42:12,895
I thought you asked her to do that.

1449
01:42:12,979 --> 01:42:15,478
Boys, can we talk about it on the way?

1450
01:42:15,562 --> 01:42:17,478
We still have to get out of here

1451
01:42:17,562 --> 01:42:19,312
and catch the Plague Doctor. Right?

1452
01:42:28,729 --> 01:42:30,279
You're exiting Saint Petersburg

1453
01:42:41,729 --> 01:42:43,062
Igor. What's this place?

1454
01:42:43,562 --> 01:42:46,212
-Prokopenko's country house.
-Is he the Plague Doctor?

1455
01:42:46,812 --> 01:42:47,771
What?

1456
01:42:48,979 --> 01:42:51,929
No, you're going to stay put here
until I waste Razumovskiy.

1457
01:42:58,187 --> 01:42:59,562
Razumovskiy?

1458
01:43:00,521 --> 01:43:02,437
I knew he was involved.

1459
01:43:02,521 --> 01:43:04,437
It's going to be sensational.

1460
01:43:04,521 --> 01:43:06,771
-Igor, me must go together.
-No way.

1461
01:43:07,646 --> 01:43:08,603
You'll stay here.

1462
01:43:08,687 --> 01:43:09,562
I'll do it on my own.

1463
01:43:09,646 --> 01:43:11,478
You got me out.
Your conscience is clear now.

1464
01:43:11,562 --> 01:43:12,562
Good job.

1465
01:43:13,437 --> 01:43:14,312
You got what you wanted?

1466
01:43:14,396 --> 01:43:17,096
Now you know who the Plague Doctor is.
Go make a video.

1467
01:43:25,812 --> 01:43:27,979
You know, Igor. I understood something.

1468
01:43:28,896 --> 01:43:30,854
I'm not a pussy. I'm a hound.

1469
01:43:33,229 --> 01:43:34,062
You are

1470
01:43:35,271 --> 01:43:36,146
a hound too.

1471
01:43:36,812 --> 01:43:39,104
And she's also a hound.

1472
01:43:40,062 --> 01:43:42,521
We must stay together.

1473
01:43:43,146 --> 01:43:45,729
Because we are a damn pack!

1474
01:43:51,771 --> 01:43:54,021
I am afraid to trust a wrong person.

1475
01:43:59,687 --> 01:44:01,637
But friends in need are friends indeed.

1476
01:44:05,937 --> 01:44:08,387
Take the torch.
Go grab a gun in the storage room.

1477
01:44:16,604 --> 01:44:18,770
Igor, there's nothing except jars here.

1478
01:44:18,854 --> 01:44:19,729
Sorry, man.

1479
01:44:23,562 --> 01:44:26,312
Open the door, Igor.
It's not funny, you hear me?

1480
01:44:26,396 --> 01:44:28,021
I can't believe he fell for it.

1481
01:44:28,604 --> 01:44:30,146
You'll stay in charge.

1482
01:44:30,812 --> 01:44:33,662
You open the door in a couple of hours
when he calms down.

1483
01:44:35,479 --> 01:44:36,312
Igor!

1484
01:44:36,396 --> 01:44:38,437
Hide the car. They'll be looking for it.

1485
01:44:40,521 --> 01:44:41,479
Damn.

1486
01:44:53,437 --> 01:44:54,979
Your father?

1487
01:45:00,812 --> 01:45:01,712
Two peas in a pod.

1488
01:45:07,479 --> 01:45:08,312
Igor.

1489
01:45:12,271 --> 01:45:14,146
Wait. You have any kind of a plan?

1490
01:45:17,521 --> 01:45:18,437
Sure.

1491
01:45:21,187 --> 01:45:22,062
What?

1492
01:45:27,979 --> 01:45:28,854
Good luck.

1493
01:46:05,729 --> 01:46:07,829
Stop right there before I call the police.

1494
01:46:09,187 --> 01:46:10,020
I'm kidding.

1495
01:46:10,104 --> 01:46:12,062
Hello, Igor. Please come in.

1496
01:46:18,937 --> 01:46:20,437
Greetings, Igor.

1497
01:46:21,562 --> 01:46:23,812
I didn't think
you would get out that quickly.

1498
01:46:26,437 --> 01:46:27,271
Nevertheless,

1499
01:46:28,146 --> 01:46:30,103
you can never stop me

1500
01:46:30,187 --> 01:46:31,728
from saving the city.

1501
01:46:31,812 --> 01:46:34,770
I gave money back to the clients
Isayeva cheated in her bank.

1502
01:46:34,854 --> 01:46:36,437
I bought Zilchenko's dump site,

1503
01:46:36,521 --> 01:46:38,812
and I'll clear out the city.

1504
01:46:38,896 --> 01:46:41,604
Grechkin and Bekhtiev,
they died for a reason.

1505
01:46:42,271 --> 01:46:44,312
Without them I can build a new

1506
01:46:46,312 --> 01:46:48,021
perfect city.

1507
01:46:49,979 --> 01:46:51,562
No one can stand in my way.

1508
01:46:53,646 --> 01:46:54,687
Even you.

1509
01:46:54,771 --> 01:46:55,646
You sure?

1510
01:47:23,437 --> 01:47:25,021
Nice try.

1511
01:47:26,271 --> 01:47:28,312
Margo, stream the video.

1512
01:47:28,396 --> 01:47:30,104
Yes, Sergey. You're on.

1513
01:47:32,229 --> 01:47:36,437
You're watching this video,
and that means I got busted.

1514
01:47:37,437 --> 01:47:38,437
But that doesn't mean

1515
01:47:38,521 --> 01:47:39,979
that it's all over.

1516
01:47:41,354 --> 01:47:43,103
I call on all the people

1517
01:47:43,187 --> 01:47:45,437
who believe in fair trials.

1518
01:47:46,437 --> 01:47:49,728
You know those who poison our city

1519
01:47:49,812 --> 01:47:51,479
and you know how they do it.

1520
01:47:52,146 --> 01:47:54,062
I give you their names and addresses.

1521
01:47:54,146 --> 01:47:55,146
You know what to do.

1522
01:47:56,146 --> 01:47:59,854
You can stop them.

1523
01:48:00,687 --> 01:48:03,437
These morons will try to escape.

1524
01:48:03,521 --> 01:48:06,395
Don't let them do that.

1525
01:48:06,479 --> 01:48:07,937
I'm going to help you.

1526
01:48:08,021 --> 01:48:09,103
We're going back.

1527
01:48:09,187 --> 01:48:12,812
I've got another joker up my sleeve.

1528
01:48:12,896 --> 01:48:15,312
I'd rather die a free man

1529
01:48:15,396 --> 01:48:18,562
than spend the rest of my life in jail.

1530
01:48:18,646 --> 01:48:21,853
And I'll take to my grave corrupt pigs

1531
01:48:21,937 --> 01:48:24,437
who run errands for scumbags.

1532
01:48:32,437 --> 01:48:34,770
The police can't stop you.

1533
01:48:34,854 --> 01:48:37,520
You finish what I started.

1534
01:48:37,604 --> 01:48:40,646
Now each of you is the Plague Doctor.

1535
01:48:51,354 --> 01:48:52,687
What did you do?

1536
01:48:52,771 --> 01:48:53,687
Relax, Igor.

1537
01:48:54,604 --> 01:48:56,603
Everything's going on as planned.

1538
01:48:56,687 --> 01:49:00,437
The human trash will go out to the streets
because they're sure

1539
01:49:01,187 --> 01:49:02,312
of their impunity.

1540
01:49:06,562 --> 01:49:09,395
The military will come in the city
in a couple of hours

1541
01:49:09,479 --> 01:49:11,396
to clear it out

1542
01:49:12,771 --> 01:49:13,979
once and for all.

1543
01:49:15,104 --> 01:49:17,145
I'll get rid of the moneybags

1544
01:49:17,229 --> 01:49:18,562
who poison the city

1545
01:49:18,646 --> 01:49:20,562
and the scum of the earth who mimic me.

1546
01:49:20,646 --> 01:49:23,228
You know how many people were killed?

1547
01:49:23,312 --> 01:49:25,187
How many more are going to die?

1548
01:49:25,271 --> 01:49:26,354
Does it matter?

1549
01:49:27,229 --> 01:49:28,937
I'm ready to do whatever it takes.

1550
01:50:31,062 --> 01:50:32,687
Look at this braveheart!

1551
01:50:32,771 --> 01:50:33,729
Come on!

1552
01:50:34,604 --> 01:50:37,687
Get him!

1553
01:50:45,229 --> 01:50:47,562
One, two - we'll find you too
Three, four - you're at death's door

1554
01:50:47,646 --> 01:50:49,145
The High And Mighty Who's Next?

1555
01:50:49,229 --> 01:50:51,145
Five, six - we'll burn you, pricks

1556
01:50:51,229 --> 01:50:52,929
Seven, eight - you'll shit bricks.

1557
01:51:08,687 --> 01:51:11,562
When the justice system is
utterly corrupted

1558
01:51:12,562 --> 01:51:15,396
When crinkling and crackling bills can
change any law

1559
01:51:16,562 --> 01:51:19,771
Stones, clubs and knives come from nowhere

1560
01:51:20,437 --> 01:51:22,729
Into the hands of duped fools

1561
01:51:24,229 --> 01:51:26,854
Justice comes in with smashed shop windows

1562
01:51:28,354 --> 01:51:30,520
Midnight streetlamps ooze panic

1563
01:51:30,604 --> 01:51:32,187
The Judge. 26, Fontanka Embankment

1564
01:51:32,271 --> 01:51:34,771
Wild crowd stands united

1565
01:51:36,354 --> 01:51:39,562
With a never-ending cry
'Let it all burn to hell!'

1566
01:51:43,146 --> 01:51:45,729
I'll give you everything.

1567
01:51:50,396 --> 01:51:52,021
Here… You can take it.

1568
01:52:04,104 --> 01:52:05,937
Grandpa, who is he?

1569
01:52:29,396 --> 01:52:30,354
Igor.

1570
01:52:32,396 --> 01:52:33,646
You don't stand a chance.

1571
01:52:40,229 --> 01:52:41,604
Goddamnit!

1572
01:52:44,146 --> 01:52:45,937
You can't hide in here.

1573
01:53:20,854 --> 01:53:22,812
Igor, the city wants me!

1574
01:53:22,896 --> 01:53:25,520
I've got money, technologies,
and the power!

1575
01:53:25,604 --> 01:53:26,687
What do you have?

1576
01:53:28,729 --> 01:53:29,937
He's got friends.

1577
01:53:39,104 --> 01:53:41,021
Are you okay? You okay?

1578
01:53:42,021 --> 01:53:43,221
What are you doing here?

1579
01:53:44,854 --> 01:53:46,312
What are you doing here?

1580
01:53:48,354 --> 01:53:50,770
Take cover! Now!

1581
01:53:50,854 --> 01:53:51,979
Get out of here!

1582
01:53:52,179 --> 01:54:10,179
Download Movie -> UFSIMV.COM

1583
01:54:55,521 --> 01:54:56,896
Think!

1584
01:55:11,729 --> 01:55:12,771
Think!

1585
01:55:28,354 --> 01:55:29,396
Think!

1586
01:55:47,479 --> 01:55:48,629
Nothing to think about.

1587
01:56:41,804 --> 01:56:44,095
What's this pathetic rumble about?

1588
01:56:44,179 --> 01:56:46,762
We hate this kind of mess on our block.

1589
01:56:49,179 --> 01:56:51,012
Get them!!!

1590
01:57:03,221 --> 01:57:04,221
Sunny…

1591
01:57:05,471 --> 01:57:06,804
Alive!

1592
01:57:08,387 --> 01:57:09,387
Fyodor Ivanovich.

1593
01:57:46,929 --> 01:57:49,220
Come on! Come on!

1594
01:57:49,304 --> 01:57:50,971
Go! Go!

1595
01:58:08,929 --> 01:58:10,304
You saved my life.

1596
01:58:11,887 --> 01:58:13,220
Twice.

1597
01:58:13,304 --> 01:58:14,137
Right.

1598
01:58:15,096 --> 01:58:16,553
Friends in need are friends indeed.

1599
01:58:16,637 --> 01:58:17,637
You know.

1600
01:58:20,679 --> 01:58:21,887
I was wrong.

1601
01:58:23,137 --> 01:58:24,262
I'd never have done it

1602
01:58:25,596 --> 01:58:26,554
without you.

1603
01:58:29,471 --> 01:58:30,512
Partner.

1604
01:58:35,471 --> 01:58:37,929
Wanna kiss each other?

1605
01:58:38,846 --> 01:58:40,845
Hey, bad boy.

1606
01:58:40,929 --> 01:58:42,137
Why are you so happy?

1607
01:58:43,346 --> 01:58:45,296
You'll serve a life sentence in prison.

1608
01:58:46,512 --> 01:58:48,554
Really? You don't get it?

1609
01:58:50,637 --> 01:58:53,087
Cops are sure
that you're the Plague Doctor, Igor.

1610
01:58:54,887 --> 01:58:55,887
Think about it.

1611
01:58:56,804 --> 01:58:58,678
You escaped from the police station.

1612
01:58:58,762 --> 01:59:00,595
You're behind the bomb attack

1613
01:59:00,679 --> 01:59:02,262
and the mass riots.

1614
01:59:04,179 --> 01:59:07,229
And then you attacked the one and the only
Sergey Razumovskiy.

1615
01:59:08,304 --> 01:59:10,204
You put on this stupid costume on him.

1616
01:59:10,971 --> 01:59:12,845
I'll walk free,

1617
01:59:12,929 --> 01:59:14,887
and you'll get a life sentence.

1618
01:59:14,971 --> 01:59:16,021
Together with your…

1619
01:59:17,721 --> 01:59:18,762
…friends.

1620
01:59:28,387 --> 01:59:29,262
Look over there.

1621
01:59:37,304 --> 01:59:38,846
Think!

1622
01:59:40,012 --> 01:59:42,928
You know how many people were killed?

1623
01:59:43,012 --> 01:59:44,562
How many more are going to die?

1624
01:59:45,554 --> 01:59:46,762
Does it matter?

1625
01:59:47,512 --> 01:59:49,387
I'm ready to do whatever it takes.

1626
01:59:50,596 --> 01:59:54,178
You know, I already made a video
on the true identity of the Plague Doctor.

1627
01:59:54,262 --> 01:59:56,929
That was a cherry on top.

1628
01:59:57,596 --> 01:59:58,429
Thanks.

1629
01:59:59,887 --> 02:00:01,137
Wanna add anything?

1630
02:00:15,596 --> 02:00:17,446
And what did you get out of it, Igor?

1631
02:00:19,512 --> 02:00:20,912
You're back on track, right?

1632
02:00:22,929 --> 02:00:23,971
Good job.

1633
02:00:25,221 --> 02:00:26,871
Do you really think I'm an idiot?

1634
02:00:28,887 --> 02:00:30,054
A stupid cop?

1635
02:00:30,846 --> 02:00:32,512
Who doesn't understand a thing?

1636
02:00:32,596 --> 02:00:34,196
You're a watchdog of the regime.

1637
02:00:35,054 --> 02:00:36,654
I see what's going on every day.

1638
02:00:38,971 --> 02:00:40,012
In the streets.

1639
02:00:41,012 --> 02:00:42,862
Not from the top floor of your tower.

1640
02:00:44,804 --> 02:00:47,679
Injustice, lawlessness and stuff.

1641
02:00:48,387 --> 02:00:51,087
You think you're the only one
who wants to help people?

1642
02:00:52,096 --> 02:00:53,346
Did you read Dostoevsky?

1643
02:00:56,096 --> 02:00:57,512
You can't kill people.

1644
02:00:58,721 --> 02:01:00,720
Even the worst people.

1645
02:01:00,804 --> 02:01:02,803
Or else the world will go crazy.

1646
02:01:02,887 --> 02:01:03,762
Like you did.

1647
02:01:06,096 --> 02:01:09,346
I was this city's only hope.

1648
02:01:18,971 --> 02:01:21,262
The city can survive without you.

1649
02:01:34,012 --> 02:01:35,062
It took them forever.

1650
02:01:41,179 --> 02:01:42,887
Fyodor Ivanovich, I thought…

1651
02:01:42,971 --> 02:01:44,471
-I thought you…
-Easy, easy.

1652
02:01:45,512 --> 02:01:48,678
It's okay. I'm fine.

1653
02:01:48,762 --> 02:01:50,637
Don't even dream about it.

1654
02:01:53,346 --> 02:01:54,971
Hello, my little friend.

1655
02:01:56,387 --> 02:01:57,304
Do it.

1656
02:02:00,471 --> 02:02:01,970
Did you do it alone again?

1657
02:02:02,054 --> 02:02:03,096
Fyodor Ivanovich.

1658
02:02:05,346 --> 02:02:06,595
My friends helped me.

1659
02:02:06,679 --> 02:02:09,029
What's the reason for the party?
I don't get it.

1660
02:02:12,596 --> 02:02:13,637
Don't.

1661
02:02:14,387 --> 02:02:15,346
Well, general, sir?

1662
02:02:16,096 --> 02:02:18,746
We're gonna have a nice talk soon.
About your pension.

1663
02:02:19,721 --> 02:02:20,929
And you, lovebirds,

1664
02:02:21,887 --> 02:02:24,887
you'll go make mittens
in a Siberian labor camp.

1665
02:02:31,137 --> 02:02:32,471
Any questions?

1666
02:02:33,512 --> 02:02:36,220
-Let's get back to work, dudes.
-Yes sir.

1667
02:02:36,304 --> 02:02:37,720
-Get back to work.
-Hello.

1668
02:02:37,804 --> 02:02:39,262
-My name is Yulia Pchyolkina.
-Okay.

1669
02:02:39,346 --> 02:02:41,095
Nice to meet you.
Can I take a picture of you?

1670
02:02:41,179 --> 02:02:43,054
-Yes, sure.
-Come closer, please.

1671
02:02:44,054 --> 02:02:46,346
Dubin. Let's take a picture.

1672
02:02:48,387 --> 02:02:50,137
Don't say a word. Just smile.

1673
02:02:53,262 --> 02:02:54,096
Thank you.

1674
02:02:54,929 --> 02:02:55,971
You're welcome.

1675
02:02:57,387 --> 02:02:58,387
Why?

1676
02:02:59,679 --> 02:03:01,053
Why didn't I see her before?

1677
02:03:01,137 --> 02:03:02,720
Well…

1678
02:03:02,804 --> 02:03:05,512
What's that?
You invite her to a dinner at my place.

1679
02:03:05,596 --> 02:03:07,804
-No way…
-You heard me.

1680
02:03:10,804 --> 02:03:12,428
That's my leather jacket.

1681
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:14,096
Fyodor Ivanovich, I…

1682
02:03:17,262 --> 02:03:19,221
And that's my bike.

1683
02:03:20,346 --> 02:03:22,304
Mine.

1684
02:03:24,179 --> 02:03:25,346
Igor…

1685
02:03:26,012 --> 02:03:26,846
It's…

1686
02:03:27,804 --> 02:03:28,887
…mine.

1687
02:03:32,346 --> 02:03:33,596
Easy, scumbags!

1688
02:03:34,304 --> 02:03:35,595
Easy!

1689
02:03:35,679 --> 02:03:38,220
I peeped out of the window
and saw a showdown.

1690
02:03:38,304 --> 02:03:41,137
I belled the dudes. We're the gang.

1691
02:03:41,221 --> 02:03:42,845
We went out to see what's going on.
I went like…

1692
02:03:42,929 --> 02:03:44,887
Got it? That's what I did.

1693
02:03:44,971 --> 02:03:46,887
And then the fuzz came in the game.

1694
02:03:46,971 --> 02:03:49,720
Sensational developments
in the case of the Plague Doctor.

1695
02:03:49,804 --> 02:03:52,220
He was identified as Sergey Razumovskiy,

1696
02:03:52,304 --> 02:03:54,095
the founder of Vmeste social network.

1697
02:03:54,179 --> 02:03:57,053
Yevgeniy Strelkov
who personally arrested the criminal

1698
02:03:57,137 --> 02:04:00,179
promised to do his best
to expedite the legal proceedings.

1699
02:04:01,346 --> 02:04:03,887
When the true intentions
of the Plague Doctor were made public,

1700
02:04:03,971 --> 02:04:06,053
his popularity immediately waned.

1701
02:04:06,137 --> 02:04:10,262
Today the authorities announced the launch
of a large-scale judicial reform.

1702
02:04:10,346 --> 02:04:13,845
The mere fact of the extremely active
public response to these events

1703
02:04:13,929 --> 02:04:17,971
confirms the urgency
and demand for changes.

1704
02:04:24,096 --> 02:04:25,012
Thanks.

1705
02:04:25,887 --> 02:04:26,721
Wow!

1706
02:04:27,346 --> 02:04:28,512
Awesome!

1707
02:04:29,221 --> 02:04:31,346
Igor, how did you find this place?

1708
02:04:32,179 --> 02:04:34,012
I was here a couple of days ago.

1709
02:04:37,429 --> 02:04:40,471
Yulia, will you stop binge watching
your own videos?

1710
02:04:40,971 --> 02:04:43,053
We kinda came here
to spend some time together.

1711
02:04:43,137 --> 02:04:44,096
Major Grom…

1712
02:04:46,137 --> 02:04:48,095
Did you see how many likes we got?

1713
02:04:48,179 --> 02:04:49,470
-I did.
-Here you are.

1714
02:04:49,554 --> 02:04:51,596
I dunno. The title sounds too pompous.

1715
02:04:52,262 --> 02:04:53,804
I'm no superhero.

1716
02:04:55,221 --> 02:04:56,429
I can't fly

1717
02:04:57,179 --> 02:04:58,679
or shoot laser from my eyes.

1718
02:05:00,179 --> 02:05:01,928
I don't have this thing either.

1719
02:05:02,012 --> 02:05:06,137
A superhero isn't a man with superpowers.
He's the man who defeated super villains.

1720
02:05:07,179 --> 02:05:08,054
How about that?

1721
02:05:09,679 --> 02:05:11,803
-Right?
-That's the best line in your video.

1722
02:05:11,887 --> 02:05:13,887
-You got it?
-Try it before it gets cold.

1723
02:05:25,096 --> 02:05:26,096
What d'you say?

1724
02:05:32,429 --> 02:05:33,637
It's delicious.

1725
02:05:35,054 --> 02:05:36,762
They stuff fresh meat in it.

1726
02:05:36,846 --> 02:05:38,696
The cat was still alive this morning.

1727
02:05:45,721 --> 02:05:47,345
Come on. What's wrong with you?

1728
02:05:47,429 --> 02:05:48,762
With me?

1729
02:06:03,679 --> 02:06:04,554
Shit.

1730
02:06:06,887 --> 02:06:08,387
No more blank pages.

1731
02:06:11,054 --> 02:06:12,204
Can you hold it for me?

1732
02:06:13,512 --> 02:06:15,862
-Let me take a look.
-No, it's for my eyes only.

1733
02:06:18,221 --> 02:06:20,428
Yulia, that's your portrait.

1734
02:06:20,512 --> 02:06:22,928
-Igor, that's not funny.
-What?

1735
02:06:23,012 --> 02:06:24,928
-It is!
-Yulia, don't look!

1736
02:06:25,012 --> 02:06:27,512
-Take it easy! Come on!
-Igor, I'm not kidding!

1737
02:06:27,596 --> 02:06:30,262
-Igor, leave him alone.
-If you say so.

1738
02:06:31,137 --> 02:06:32,137
That's okay.

Do you want to sedate him?

1753
02:09:08,221 --> 02:09:09,721
No need, Sofia.

1754
02:09:12,887 --> 02:09:15,971
He's a very unusual case.

1755
02:09:20,054 --> 02:09:21,596
A very interesting one.

1756
02:09:25,096 --> 02:09:27,012
Don't worry.

1757
02:09:27,554 --> 02:09:30,512
We'll get out of here soon.

And then…
