3
00:02:25,397 --> 00:02:26,440
Yeah. Yeah.

4
00:02:29,944 --> 00:02:31,862
Right up there. Right up in here.

5
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:41,580
Aim for the rock!

6
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,608
Mankins!

7
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:10,860
Yeah?

8
00:03:10,943 --> 00:03:13,821
You wanna tell me why
your methane sensors are off?

9
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:18,742
I don't know.

10
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:21,078
Maybe the batteries are dead.

11
00:03:22,454 --> 00:03:24,874
- Why don't you get us a canary?
- This is no joke.

12
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:28,210
These are to alert you
to concentrations of methane.

13
00:03:28,794 --> 00:03:29,879
They must stay on.

14
00:04:01,118 --> 00:04:03,287
Where'd that come from?

15
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,914
Sounds like the open pit.

16
00:04:06,123 --> 00:04:07,249
We hit a methane pocket.

17
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,043
That's impossible.

18
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:11,879
Everybody, out! Everybody, out!

19
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:17,592
- Come on!
- Go!

20
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:20,512
Go. Go, go.

21
00:04:21,013 --> 00:04:22,347
No!

22
00:04:47,664 --> 00:04:48,748
Go, go, go!

23
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:28,956
What you got in here, Gurty?

24
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,709
Come on. You can say it. You can say it.

25
00:05:34,503 --> 00:05:38,507
We will sort right here, and they
will save their hands right there.

26
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:40,801
The coffee saved with water for me!

27
00:05:41,301 --> 00:05:42,845
For him. For them.

28
00:05:42,928 --> 00:05:46,181
Is it coffee, Gurty?

29
00:05:51,103 --> 00:05:53,856
This how you guys
still get your kicks, huh?

30
00:05:55,732 --> 00:05:56,776
Walk away, Gurty.

31
00:05:56,859 --> 00:05:58,693
- They're idiots.
- Hey.

32
00:06:01,405 --> 00:06:03,949
How's it feel
to be best friends with a retard?

33
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:08,203
He's my brother, Johansson.

34
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:11,540
And I told you never to call him that.

35
00:06:12,332 --> 00:06:13,708
Retard.

36
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:25,512
McCann, get in here!

37
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:32,853
I know what you get, but I talk
with a lot of hands for hands sometimes.

38
00:06:33,645 --> 00:06:34,521
Gurty.

39
00:06:37,107 --> 00:06:38,067
We're fired.

40
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:43,405
But tires to a point rotated go.

41
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:45,866
Let someone else rotate them. We're fired.

42
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,327
Pack your shit up. Skeeter too.

43
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,244
Come on.

44
00:06:57,502 --> 00:06:58,879
I don't want.

45
00:06:58,963 --> 00:07:01,381
- Me never been in, then today we don't.
- Yeah, I know.

46
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:03,675
Gurty, I don't care! You're going in!

47
00:07:04,468 --> 00:07:06,053
They're gonna look after you.

48
00:07:07,012 --> 00:07:09,098
We've been together a long time,

49
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:13,185
but he can't hold a job,
and I can't carry him anymore.

50
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:15,980
I don't have
a lot of tire left on my own treads.

51
00:07:16,981 --> 00:07:19,608
Will this help
make him self-sufficient, Doctor?

52
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:23,237
I can't promise anything
with language cognition scores like these,

53
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,738
but we'll see what we can do.

54
00:07:25,823 --> 00:07:29,326
Hi, John, I'm Dr. Talbot.
Pleased to meet you.

55
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:32,204
Thank you, I appreciate it
and hope the world lasts for you.

56
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:33,789
He's saying hello.

57
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:36,041
How long to go with them?

58
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,793
With them for the time over.

59
00:07:37,877 --> 00:07:39,294
For them. For me.

60
00:07:39,378 --> 00:07:41,630
He's asking what all this entails, Doctor.

61
00:07:42,131 --> 00:07:43,382
Well, just a few tests.

62
00:07:43,465 --> 00:07:46,676
If he qualifies for rehabilitation,
we arrange housing.

63
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:48,929
Should take no more than an hour.

64
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:50,680
Skeeter.

65
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:52,682
You can't bring Skeeter in here.

66
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:55,352
Let 'em poke and prod you.
It's no big deal.

67
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:57,646
I'll see you in an hour.

68
00:07:59,731 --> 00:08:00,607
Hey,

69
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,442
don't be a big baby.

70
00:08:03,027 --> 00:08:04,945
- Thanks, Doctor.
- You're welcome.

71
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:07,865
John, the examination room
is just down the hall.

72
00:08:08,448 --> 00:08:11,827
<i>Psych evaluator Hackman, dial 617.</i>

73
00:08:12,536 --> 00:08:16,040
<i>Psych evaluator Hackman, dial 617.</i>

74
00:08:19,126 --> 00:08:21,670
No readings indicated
a methane gas pocket?

75
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:25,049
So you're saying,
as general manager of this facility,

76
00:08:25,132 --> 00:08:27,342
that this was out of the blue?

77
00:08:27,426 --> 00:08:29,428
Completely out of the blue, sir.

78
00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:32,139
We think the gas built up
behind the stoping shields

79
00:08:32,222 --> 00:08:34,391
where our PDM sensors couldn't pick it up.

80
00:08:34,975 --> 00:08:37,019
<i>I'm briefing
the Prime Minister in 20 minutes.</i>

81
00:08:37,102 --> 00:08:38,062
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

82
00:08:38,145 --> 00:08:42,691
<i>No one goes in any of the tunnels
until that gas is drilled and capped.</i>

83
00:08:42,775 --> 00:08:44,443
Understood, sir. Understood.

84
00:08:44,985 --> 00:08:47,321
Let me ask you, how do we drill and cap

85
00:08:47,947 --> 00:08:50,157
a methane pocket without a wellhead?

86
00:08:52,284 --> 00:08:53,911
I'll get back to you.

87
00:08:57,289 --> 00:09:01,460
Get me the air force base in Winnipeg,
officer in charge of civilian emergencies.

88
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:05,881
Airlift a 30-ton gas wellhead?

89
00:09:06,548 --> 00:09:07,466
Impossible.

90
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:10,803
And there's no runway
up at Katka to land a C-130 on,

91
00:09:10,886 --> 00:09:14,849
and our largest choppers are Chinooks,
which can't carry a 30-ton wellhead.

92
00:09:14,932 --> 00:09:17,184
Payloads of that nature
have to go by truck.

93
00:09:20,729 --> 00:09:24,608
Jill, that young field officer in Winnipeg
is supposed to know

94
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:27,236
everything about ice road transports
up to the northern mines?

95
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:28,863
- <i>You mean Max Tully?</i>
- Yes, him.

96
00:09:28,946 --> 00:09:30,948
The Prime Minister
will see you now, sir.

97
00:09:31,031 --> 00:09:31,991
Just a sec.

98
00:09:32,616 --> 00:09:33,700
Max Tully?

99
00:09:35,494 --> 00:09:36,703
Mr. Goldenrod!

100
00:09:38,122 --> 00:09:38,956
What?

101
00:09:43,002 --> 00:09:46,213
I'm Max Tully with Mining Safety.
Could I have a word with you?

102
00:09:46,296 --> 00:09:47,297
It's about Katka mine.

103
00:09:48,173 --> 00:09:49,133
What about Katka?

104
00:09:49,216 --> 00:09:51,135
This morning, Tunnel 6 collapsed.

105
00:09:51,218 --> 00:09:54,638
I need an 18-foot gas wellhead,
300 feet of pipe delivered up there

106
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:56,056
in under 30 hours.

107
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,894
Eighteen-foot gas wellhead
and 300 feet of pipe?

108
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:02,855
Goddamn, that's
a hell of a lot of weight, son.

109
00:10:02,938 --> 00:10:04,231
Can you make it happen?

110
00:10:04,314 --> 00:10:07,026
What do I look like, God?
We're three weeks into April.

111
00:10:07,109 --> 00:10:09,111
All of my drivers
are on their way to Hawaii

112
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:11,738
or wherever the hell it is
they go during the off-season.

113
00:10:11,822 --> 00:10:14,158
Say, for conversation's sake,
you have replacements.

114
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:17,744
Say, for conversation's sake, these rigs
have wings. What've you been smoking?

115
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:21,456
March 10th, the season ended.
That's five weeks ago.

116
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,084
But didn't old-timers in the '60s
drive the lake into April?

117
00:10:24,168 --> 00:10:26,211
Yeah, and most of 'em died doing it.

118
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:28,047
So it's really that dangerous.

119
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,714
Yeah. It's that dangerous.

120
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,842
Okay, okay. It's a stupid idea.

121
00:10:31,926 --> 00:10:33,010
Sorry for asking.

122
00:10:37,681 --> 00:10:39,599
Hey, hey, kid. Come here.

123
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,648
I know all the miners up there in Katka.
I know their families.

124
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:50,360
So, it's personal with me.

125
00:10:50,945 --> 00:10:52,947
If I can get drivers and a mechanic,

126
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:55,825
let's say 3:00 this afternoon,

127
00:10:55,908 --> 00:10:58,035
and if <i>you</i> can get
the provincial government

128
00:10:58,118 --> 00:10:59,453
to open up the ice road,

129
00:10:59,954 --> 00:11:01,413
two very big ifs…

130
00:11:05,793 --> 00:11:06,919
we'll do it.

131
00:11:08,212 --> 00:11:09,046
Thank you.

132
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:13,843
Shit.

133
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:19,306
Hi. Um…

134
00:11:23,393 --> 00:11:25,229
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

135
00:11:25,312 --> 00:11:28,565
I brought my brother in this morning.
Vocational rehab?

136
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:30,275
McCann, 813.

137
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:32,236
He's still being evaluated, sir.

138
00:11:33,362 --> 00:11:36,031
The doctor said an hour.
It's been two and a half.

139
00:11:36,115 --> 00:11:38,700
We're a little short-staffed today,
so please take a seat.

140
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:42,079
Hey! Sir?

141
00:11:42,746 --> 00:11:44,206
Sir!

142
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:45,749
Get security on 2-East, please.

143
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:51,630
Hey, bro.

144
00:11:53,257 --> 00:11:54,258
What's happening?

145
00:11:55,425 --> 00:11:56,426
What is all this?

146
00:12:01,556 --> 00:12:02,808
Oh jeez.

147
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:05,936
What is going on here?

148
00:12:06,436 --> 00:12:08,480
Xanax and Lexapro, right?

149
00:12:08,563 --> 00:12:12,151
Probably some Oxy for good measure?
You know, to take the edge off?

150
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:14,403
- They're for PTSD.
- I know what they're for.

151
00:12:14,486 --> 00:12:16,071
Did you ask for these, Gurty?

152
00:12:16,155 --> 00:12:19,158
He has insomnia, hypertension,
makes inappropriate outbursts.

153
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:21,493
Kiss my Irish ass.

154
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:24,288
Post-traumatic stress disorder is real.

155
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:25,956
I can Section 502 him.

156
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:27,666
Do it.

157
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:31,670
The press'll love another story
about how the VA overprescribes opioids

158
00:12:31,754 --> 00:12:32,880
to America's heroes.

159
00:12:32,963 --> 00:12:34,673
You are making a grave mistake.

160
00:12:35,382 --> 00:12:37,843
You try and stop us
from leaving here, so are you.

161
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,847
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

162
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:43,473
Put this on.

163
00:12:43,557 --> 00:12:44,975
Come on. It's cold.

164
00:12:47,394 --> 00:12:48,938
Wait, here. Here.

165
00:12:52,691 --> 00:12:53,901
Come on, your pants.

166
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:23,973
Ken... Kenworth.

167
00:13:24,056 --> 00:13:25,307
More Ken.

168
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,226
Take us great that owned we.

169
00:13:28,018 --> 00:13:29,019
We.

170
00:13:29,103 --> 00:13:32,982
Sure, sure. It would be great
if we owned our own rig.

171
00:13:33,774 --> 00:13:35,317
Did you win the lottery?

172
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,070
Did you happen to win
the Pick-6 and not tell me?

173
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:41,198
This thing costs 200 grand, Gurty.

174
00:13:42,324 --> 00:13:43,575
200.

175
00:14:50,142 --> 00:14:51,977
Ever been to Winnipeg, Gurty?

176
00:14:53,145 --> 00:14:54,438
It's just 70 miles.

177
00:14:58,108 --> 00:15:00,027
"Win a pig."

178
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:02,446
We might, partner.

179
00:15:03,655 --> 00:15:07,159
With any luck,
today we might just win a pig.

180
00:15:12,497 --> 00:15:15,625
<i>News all day, every day.</i>

181
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:16,710
<i>Our top story,</i>

182
00:15:16,794 --> 00:15:20,464
<i>twin explosions rock Northern Manitoba's
Katka mine this morning,</i>

183
00:15:20,547 --> 00:15:24,051
<i>killing eight miners
and leaving 26 more unaccounted for.</i>

184
00:15:24,134 --> 00:15:27,179
<i>The cause of the explosion
has not been determined.</i>

185
00:15:27,262 --> 00:15:29,556
Hi, I'm calling
from Trappers Transpo in Winnipeg.

186
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,852
- We're in an emergency and need drivers.
- Tully, gimme 50 bucks. You got 50 bucks?

187
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:35,104
- Yeah, I do.
- One of my drivers just became available.

188
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:37,272
- Thanks.
- Fantastic. What's it for?

189
00:15:37,356 --> 00:15:38,190
Bail.

190
00:15:38,273 --> 00:15:40,609
- Yeah... What?
- Told you this wasn't gonna be easy.

191
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:48,492
Sunglasses and keys.

192
00:15:49,076 --> 00:15:50,828
You protest and throw rocks again,

193
00:15:51,328 --> 00:15:52,788
we'll arrest you again.

194
00:15:53,455 --> 00:15:55,833
We're gonna keep doing it
until you get off our land.

195
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,168
The city owns that parking lot.

196
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:01,088
I was referring to North America.

197
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,966
See you soon.

198
00:16:16,436 --> 00:16:18,147
How's the fight for justice going?

199
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:22,359
You keep building casinos,

200
00:16:22,442 --> 00:16:24,779
you'll beat the white man
without a shot fired.

201
00:16:29,658 --> 00:16:31,911
You heard about the cave-in up at Katka?

202
00:16:31,994 --> 00:16:33,620
Yeah, it was on the TV in there.

203
00:16:34,121 --> 00:16:36,665
I still haven't heard from Cody though.
I'm worried sick.

204
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:39,126
He's on the list of those missing.

205
00:16:40,335 --> 00:16:42,337
I'm putting together
a little rescue mission.

206
00:16:43,588 --> 00:16:44,673
Ice road?

207
00:16:44,757 --> 00:16:45,590
Yep.

208
00:16:49,386 --> 00:16:50,262
I'm in.

209
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:13,410
Let's get a head count.

210
00:17:13,493 --> 00:17:14,328
Cody.

211
00:17:16,496 --> 00:17:17,414
One.

212
00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:18,916
- Two.
- Three.

213
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:21,460
- Four.
- Five.

214
00:17:21,543 --> 00:17:23,253
- Six.
- Seven.

215
00:17:23,337 --> 00:17:24,797
- Eight.
- Nine.

216
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,090
- Ten.
- Eleven.

217
00:17:26,173 --> 00:17:27,842
- Twelve.
- Thirteen.

218
00:17:40,645 --> 00:17:43,816
<i>I got a wife and kids, Jim.
How would I even explain this to them?</i>

219
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:47,069
No one's gonna force you to go, Dave.
I understand. It's not for everyone.

220
00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:47,987
Thanks.

221
00:17:48,612 --> 00:17:50,364
- What do you got?
- Half are retired.

222
00:17:50,447 --> 00:17:52,157
Half have never seen an ice road.

223
00:17:52,241 --> 00:17:55,285
Next, there are two guys
up from North Dakota. Brothers.

224
00:17:56,453 --> 00:17:57,371
Thank you.

225
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:03,878
Which one of you guys
is Mike McCann?

226
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:05,712
- I am.
- You're the driver?

227
00:18:05,796 --> 00:18:08,090
- He's the mechanic?
- Yep. One of the best.

228
00:18:10,384 --> 00:18:13,303
Says you had experience on the ice road
in the Northwest Territory.

229
00:18:13,387 --> 00:18:15,222
That's pretty serious country.
What'd you drive?

230
00:18:15,722 --> 00:18:17,016
Anything on wheels.

231
00:18:17,516 --> 00:18:20,310
Says you've had 11 gigs
in the last eight years,

232
00:18:20,394 --> 00:18:22,354
which ain't exactly
inspiring my confidence.

233
00:18:23,022 --> 00:18:25,149
Some reason
that you can't hold down a job?

234
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:32,364
My, uh, my brother's a veteran,

235
00:18:32,447 --> 00:18:33,991
got injured in Iraq.

236
00:18:34,491 --> 00:18:37,161
Uh, he's got this thing
called aphasia, which is...

237
00:18:37,244 --> 00:18:38,078
I know what it is.

238
00:18:38,162 --> 00:18:40,790
Long story short, um,
for the past eight years,

239
00:18:40,873 --> 00:18:42,082
I've been his caretaker,

240
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,001
for lack of a better word, and…

241
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:45,878
- And we...
- I get it. I get it.

242
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:47,421
We ain't got time. What's his name?

243
00:18:47,504 --> 00:18:48,839
Call him Gurty.

244
00:18:49,673 --> 00:18:51,175
Gurty. Hey.

245
00:18:52,176 --> 00:18:53,343
Gurty, Jim Goldenrod.

246
00:18:53,844 --> 00:18:55,637
Grab your tool set. Follow me.

247
00:19:04,604 --> 00:19:05,522
Right here.

248
00:19:06,606 --> 00:19:08,483
I want you to pull the rocker arm shaft.

249
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:10,735
I'm gonna time you.

250
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:17,576
Say when.

251
00:19:20,412 --> 00:19:21,246
Go.

252
00:19:41,141 --> 00:19:42,184
Sweet Jesus.

253
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,647
Okay, Tully,

254
00:19:49,024 --> 00:19:50,860
send everybody else home and call Katka.

255
00:19:50,943 --> 00:19:52,987
- I got my crew.
- Where's Tantoo?

256
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,989
She's reparking somebody else's rig.

257
00:20:02,872 --> 00:20:04,248
She seems a little young.

258
00:20:08,502 --> 00:20:10,587
- I'll have the contracts drawn up.
- Thank you.

259
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:15,384
Enough.

260
00:20:16,093 --> 00:20:18,428
Anyone not out by now isn't coming out.

261
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:25,685
You guys hearing that?

262
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,687
What is that?

263
00:20:31,108 --> 00:20:33,778
That sounds like tap code.

264
00:20:33,861 --> 00:20:35,487
You men, give us a hand.

265
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,406
Come on.

266
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,243
Somebody had to have been
in the Army, Navy, Cub Scouts.

267
00:20:51,796 --> 00:20:53,047
What are they saying, Cody?

268
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:54,882
"How many alive?"

269
00:20:54,965 --> 00:20:57,885
Look, if you do hear something,
you call me, all right?

270
00:20:57,968 --> 00:20:58,928
Yes, sir.

271
00:21:08,813 --> 00:21:12,607
Uh, twenty-six… alive.

272
00:21:12,691 --> 00:21:14,484
Uh, Fred, listen to me. Listen.

273
00:21:14,568 --> 00:21:17,988
You tell them we're gonna cap
that methane with a wellhead, all right?

274
00:21:18,072 --> 00:21:19,114
Then we're gonna blast.

275
00:21:19,198 --> 00:21:21,951
You tell 'em those wellheads,
they're coming ASAP, all right?

276
00:21:22,034 --> 00:21:23,035
- Okay.
- Okay.

277
00:21:30,835 --> 00:21:32,795
Wellheads arrive ASAP.

278
00:21:32,878 --> 00:21:34,629
What do they mean, ASAP?

279
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:36,256
Six hours?

280
00:21:37,382 --> 00:21:38,217
Twelve hours?

281
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,384
What if it's 30?

282
00:21:39,885 --> 00:21:41,011
Then we're dead.

283
00:21:47,768 --> 00:21:49,686
The 26 includes Lampard.

284
00:21:50,855 --> 00:21:51,897
Yep.

285
00:21:52,731 --> 00:21:53,732
Mankins?

286
00:21:54,984 --> 00:21:57,027
He's alive.

287
00:21:57,862 --> 00:21:59,071
So the question is time.

288
00:22:00,322 --> 00:22:03,242
I mean, no one's ever lasted
over 30 hours under permafrost.

289
00:22:06,745 --> 00:22:08,998
Well, the government's
got that ice road open.

290
00:22:09,706 --> 00:22:13,543
Safety supervisor guy,
he's even managed to secure transpo.

291
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,421
Jim Goldenrod.

292
00:22:17,882 --> 00:22:22,344
If Jim Goldenrod believes 25-ton wellheads
can roll across a frozen lake in April,

293
00:22:22,427 --> 00:22:24,304
I suppose we should believe it too.

294
00:22:25,014 --> 00:22:25,848
All right.

295
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,518
These wellheads are beasts,
eighteen feet long,

296
00:22:29,601 --> 00:22:30,936
twenty-five-ton heavy.

297
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,563
We got three rigs,
all identically equipped

298
00:22:33,647 --> 00:22:36,817
so that we can achieve
tactical redundancy.

299
00:22:36,901 --> 00:22:39,278
We're taking every chance
to save those miners' lives.

300
00:22:39,361 --> 00:22:41,321
Tactical re-what-ancy?

301
00:22:41,405 --> 00:22:42,572
Redundancy.

302
00:22:42,656 --> 00:22:45,492
Each rig doesn't need the others
to complete the mission.

303
00:22:45,575 --> 00:22:47,536
Gold star to the man from North Dakota.

304
00:22:48,578 --> 00:22:50,289
One, two, three. The gold one is mine.

305
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,500
You two can paper-rock-scissors
for the red one.

306
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,127
She's the one with the comfy seats.

307
00:22:58,213 --> 00:22:59,339
It's all yours.

308
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:03,886
- Contracts. One for you.
- Thanks.

309
00:23:03,969 --> 00:23:05,763
One for you, and you.

310
00:23:05,846 --> 00:23:07,722
200,000 split four ways.

311
00:23:08,598 --> 00:23:09,599
Any questions?

312
00:23:10,642 --> 00:23:13,562
What happens to anyone
that doesn't make it? To their money?

313
00:23:13,645 --> 00:23:14,604
Paragraph four.

314
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:17,191
- Their share goes to those that do.
- That's pretty cold.

315
00:23:17,274 --> 00:23:19,026
Sounds fair to me. Who's that guy?

316
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,861
Mr. Varnay.

317
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:25,490
Tom Varnay,
Katka International Insurance Group.

318
00:23:25,574 --> 00:23:27,952
Tully, these are my trucks.
I say who goes.

319
00:23:28,035 --> 00:23:31,621
Your trucks, but it's Katka's insurance.
If one goes in the lake, it's on Katka.

320
00:23:31,705 --> 00:23:33,123
He's not taking a cut?

321
00:23:33,207 --> 00:23:34,374
No, no. Absolutely not.

322
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:37,795
I'm just along for the ride
and to protect Katka's investment.

323
00:23:37,878 --> 00:23:40,297
All right, you'll ride with Tantoo

324
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,216
in the black Kenworth.
Put your gear in there.

325
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:44,426
You two'll find safety bags
in the locker area.

326
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:45,469
It's time to load up.

327
00:23:45,552 --> 00:23:47,805
We'll fuel the rigs, and we'll push in 15.

328
00:23:49,264 --> 00:23:50,182
Thank you.

329
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:51,683
Thanks.

330
00:23:52,184 --> 00:23:53,185
- Thank you.
- Hello.

331
00:23:57,356 --> 00:23:59,358
Fifty grand apiece times two.

332
00:23:59,441 --> 00:24:02,694
That's more than enough
for a down payment on a rig like this.

333
00:24:04,905 --> 00:24:07,491
Sorry I ripped up your brochure,
by the way.

334
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,577
I'm gonna put Skeeter
up front with us, okay?

335
00:24:11,161 --> 00:24:12,121
Where are you?

336
00:24:16,876 --> 00:24:19,419
Tantoo, is it? Tully says you're Cree.

337
00:24:20,712 --> 00:24:21,839
What's your name mean?

338
00:24:24,591 --> 00:24:25,467
Name mean

339
00:24:26,218 --> 00:24:27,762
"like to drive alone."

340
00:24:32,474 --> 00:24:33,642
Mount up!

341
00:24:33,725 --> 00:24:36,478
Use the head if you have to now.
We're on a bull run.

342
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,314
See you on the flip side, Tully.

343
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,195
We'll run with 200-foot separations,

344
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:27,737
leapfrogging every few hours.

345
00:25:27,822 --> 00:25:30,199
- <i>Is everyone good with that?</i>
- Yep.

346
00:25:31,408 --> 00:25:32,742
Affirmativo.

347
00:25:32,827 --> 00:25:33,869
<i>First leg,</i>

348
00:25:33,953 --> 00:25:38,082
Lake Winnipeg ice road,
about 300 miles, 20 hours.

349
00:25:38,165 --> 00:25:40,500
Second leg, up over Manitoba Pass.

350
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:42,169
Third leg,

351
00:25:42,252 --> 00:25:45,089
<i>Manitonka ice road
to Old Manitonka Bridge.</i>

352
00:25:45,172 --> 00:25:46,882
<i>Twenty-three hours total.</i>

353
00:25:46,966 --> 00:25:48,467
What's wrong with New Manitonka?

354
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,344
<i>The new bridge would be preferred,</i>

355
00:25:50,427 --> 00:25:53,305
but getting up to New Manitonka
is another 90 kilometers.

356
00:25:53,388 --> 00:25:56,600
That puts us
outside the miners' oxygen window.

357
00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:00,980
Old Manitonka was built in the '60s,
so that's rated 75,000 pounds?

358
00:26:01,063 --> 00:26:03,565
Yep. We're gonna be shaving it close.

359
00:26:04,108 --> 00:26:05,234
Here we go, people.

360
00:26:32,845 --> 00:26:34,221
Oh shit.

361
00:26:35,472 --> 00:26:38,600
You said 120 meters that way, 80 that way.

362
00:26:38,683 --> 00:26:39,559
Give or take.

363
00:26:40,227 --> 00:26:41,896
Pretty decent atmospheric volume.

364
00:26:41,979 --> 00:26:44,689
Yeah, except we got
26 sets of lungs down here.

365
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:52,531
<i>Hey, Jim.</i>

366
00:26:53,698 --> 00:26:54,533
Yeah?

367
00:26:54,616 --> 00:26:57,411
I thought I heard
every trucker's expression.

368
00:26:57,912 --> 00:26:59,538
What the heck's a bull run?

369
00:26:59,621 --> 00:27:00,455
<i>Bull run.</i>

370
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,124
Well, back in Minnesota,

371
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:04,459
all the livestock haulers
never used to stop,

372
00:27:04,543 --> 00:27:07,337
'cause bulls, you see, gotta be standing
when they're being transported.

373
00:27:07,421 --> 00:27:09,381
<i>If one gets tired and lies down,</i>

374
00:27:09,464 --> 00:27:11,383
the others will step on him and kill him.

375
00:27:11,466 --> 00:27:14,594
All livestock haulers know this,
so they never stop for anything.

376
00:27:14,678 --> 00:27:18,265
Ah, I see.
I'm learning something tonight.

377
00:28:03,185 --> 00:28:05,020
Hey, Jim, how you feeling about the ice?

378
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:10,275
<i>Cold, hard, and stiff.</i>

379
00:28:11,151 --> 00:28:14,029
I wish we weren't running
in bright sunshine tomorrow though.

380
00:28:56,738 --> 00:28:57,782
You want a sandwich?

381
00:28:58,698 --> 00:29:00,325
You haven't eaten since we left.

382
00:29:01,576 --> 00:29:04,246
You'll know when I'm hungry.
It's very unattractive.

383
00:29:05,164 --> 00:29:06,290
You get cranky?

384
00:29:07,124 --> 00:29:08,250
Worse, I act white.

385
00:29:12,755 --> 00:29:15,090
Tully said you and Goldenrod
had a falling-out.

386
00:29:16,091 --> 00:29:17,426
That wasn't a big deal.

387
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,719
Sounded like a big deal.

388
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:23,557
He fired me.
I got upset, took a swing at him.

389
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,683
It's old news.

390
00:29:28,896 --> 00:29:30,355
How's that Kenworth, boys?

391
00:29:31,648 --> 00:29:33,150
She's a fine ride, Jim.

392
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,861
Thinking we might get one just like it.

393
00:29:37,404 --> 00:29:39,698
Well, what you gonna call her?

394
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:42,952
<i>Take your time, boys.
Naming a big rig's a sacred thing.</i>

395
00:29:43,618 --> 00:29:45,287
What'll we name our truck, Gurty?

396
00:29:47,497 --> 00:29:48,916
Truck Truck Truck.

397
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:51,710
You hear that?

398
00:29:51,794 --> 00:29:54,546
"Truck Truck Truck."
I like it. It's got a ring to it.

399
00:30:00,177 --> 00:30:01,511
It is beautiful out here.

400
00:30:07,517 --> 00:30:11,063
Is it really that dangerous?
It doesn't seem like a big deal.

401
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,191
What exactly do you do?

402
00:30:15,609 --> 00:30:16,443
I'm an actuary,

403
00:30:16,526 --> 00:30:19,446
a risk-assessment professional
if we're being formal.

404
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,198
Well, Mr. Varnay,

405
00:30:22,032 --> 00:30:23,450
hauling heavy cargo on ice

406
00:30:23,533 --> 00:30:24,952
in April is a big deal.

407
00:30:26,203 --> 00:30:27,537
See Custer's head there?

408
00:30:28,956 --> 00:30:30,540
Tips us off to pressure waves.

409
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:33,919
You go too fast,
you create a pressure wave.

410
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,880
In you go.

411
00:30:37,464 --> 00:30:40,717
You go too slow, the ice can't handle
the pounds per square inch on your tire.

412
00:30:41,886 --> 00:30:42,845
In you go.

413
00:31:05,868 --> 00:31:07,912
What the hell was that? Over.

414
00:31:08,495 --> 00:31:09,872
Sounds like my head gasket.

415
00:31:13,042 --> 00:31:15,085
Come on, kid. Come on!

416
00:31:29,016 --> 00:31:30,851
Sweet Jesus, that ain't good.

417
00:31:41,946 --> 00:31:42,947
Shit.

418
00:31:51,956 --> 00:31:52,790
Shit.

419
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:55,292
What the hell are you doing?

420
00:31:56,251 --> 00:31:57,086
Going back.

421
00:31:57,169 --> 00:31:59,129
I thought
we weren't stopping for anything.

422
00:31:59,213 --> 00:32:02,967
- You know, all that "bull run" stuff?
- I said, we're going back.

423
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,760
Goddamn it!

424
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,334
Gurty's gonna run diagnostics
while we hook up. We'll pull together.

425
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:42,089
Use the nylon snatch pulleys on the rear
so the rigs can swing.

426
00:32:52,641 --> 00:32:54,643
Is this, uh, is this gonna work?

427
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,814
How… how far are we gonna tow him?

428
00:32:58,898 --> 00:33:00,315
All the way to the mine?

429
00:33:02,401 --> 00:33:05,279
Do us all a favor, Mr. Varnay,
and get back in your truck.

430
00:33:35,893 --> 00:33:37,561
Shit. Come on.

431
00:33:48,113 --> 00:33:49,114
Oh…

432
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:51,075
Gurty!

433
00:33:51,826 --> 00:33:52,785
Clear out.

434
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:55,454
What happened?

435
00:33:55,537 --> 00:33:56,997
Rear trailer tires went in.

436
00:33:59,124 --> 00:34:00,375
Oh shit.

437
00:34:05,005 --> 00:34:06,757
What the hell's going on?

438
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,801
Come on, Jim.

439
00:34:51,468 --> 00:34:53,470
Jim! Jim!

440
00:34:53,553 --> 00:34:54,388
Jim!

441
00:34:54,471 --> 00:34:55,806
Towline's got me!

442
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:57,391
Cut me loose. My leg's broken.

443
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:03,647
Cut me loose, or you're all going in!
Towline's got me, and my leg's broken.

444
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:04,731
Do it!

445
00:35:05,816 --> 00:35:07,317
- Do it!
- I can't.

446
00:35:07,943 --> 00:35:09,611
Do it! Do it!

447
00:35:14,366 --> 00:35:15,367
Jesus.

448
00:35:24,001 --> 00:35:25,585
Holy shit!

449
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,591
It's spreading out.

450
00:35:32,342 --> 00:35:33,677
Meaning what?

451
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:38,182
Meaning it's gonna keep cracking
for two, maybe three thousand meters.

452
00:35:38,682 --> 00:35:39,850
That's over a mile.

453
00:35:39,934 --> 00:35:41,811
We'll outrun it. Let's move!

454
00:35:41,894 --> 00:35:43,228
We gotta unhook first.

455
00:35:43,728 --> 00:35:44,729
There's no time.

456
00:35:45,898 --> 00:35:48,150
We're gonna have to run tied together. Go!

457
00:35:56,533 --> 00:35:57,785
Get your harness on.

458
00:36:16,136 --> 00:36:18,597
Mike, come in.
We gotta hike up the speed. Over.

459
00:36:19,223 --> 00:36:20,057
<i>Roger.</i>

460
00:36:44,081 --> 00:36:46,458
- Mike, come in. We gotta run faster.
- Roger.

461
00:36:47,251 --> 00:36:48,543
Gurty, running board.

462
00:36:54,884 --> 00:36:56,010
Get out on the running board.

463
00:36:56,093 --> 00:36:58,512
- Why?
- So if we go through, we can jump clear.

464
00:37:18,448 --> 00:37:20,159
Got a pressure wave ahead of me.

465
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:24,371
I got one hell of an ice crack behind me,
so how do you wanna die?

466
00:37:32,587 --> 00:37:35,465
Slush bed at 200 yards.
Get in and buckle up.

467
00:37:38,635 --> 00:37:41,013
Hang on, pal. This is gonna get ugly.

468
00:37:48,645 --> 00:37:50,397
This is not good. This is not good!

469
00:37:58,572 --> 00:37:59,614
I don't like this!

470
00:38:04,244 --> 00:38:05,996
Shit!

471
00:38:21,762 --> 00:38:24,514
I've got your seat belt. You okay, pal?

472
00:38:41,198 --> 00:38:42,199
We're finished.

473
00:38:53,252 --> 00:38:54,128
It stopped.

474
00:38:58,924 --> 00:38:59,759
Yeah.

475
00:39:00,342 --> 00:39:01,218
It stopped!

476
00:39:01,886 --> 00:39:03,595
We capsized for a reason.

477
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:07,057
Now our weight's displaced evenly
instead of on the tires.

478
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:13,313
So based on seven liters
per minute, per man…

479
00:39:13,397 --> 00:39:14,356
Seven liters?

480
00:39:15,232 --> 00:39:16,859
That's all a grown man breathes?

481
00:39:16,942 --> 00:39:19,862
When at rest.
The figure doubles with physical exertion.

482
00:39:20,654 --> 00:39:21,655
Hey, Cody.

483
00:39:22,322 --> 00:39:24,533
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

484
00:39:25,075 --> 00:39:28,078
When the mine blew up,
I said we hit a methane pocket,

485
00:39:28,662 --> 00:39:30,372
and you said, "That's impossible."

486
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:31,748
Why?

487
00:39:36,879 --> 00:39:38,088
It's still settling.

488
00:39:55,981 --> 00:39:57,274
Air compressor…

489
00:39:58,984 --> 00:40:00,820
Thank God they're coming through.

490
00:40:05,908 --> 00:40:06,741
…failed.

491
00:40:10,454 --> 00:40:11,455
Hey.

492
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:13,833
What's the story, Cody?

493
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:14,917
Yeah.

494
00:40:15,876 --> 00:40:17,002
What'd they say?

495
00:40:25,094 --> 00:40:26,971
They say they're still working on it.

496
00:40:31,851 --> 00:40:32,852
- Cody.
- Yeah?

497
00:40:39,942 --> 00:40:41,318
You didn't answer my question.

498
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:44,029
Why is it impossible
we hit a methane pocket?

499
00:40:49,409 --> 00:40:51,161
'Cause I was told it would never happen.

500
00:40:51,871 --> 00:40:53,038
By who?

501
00:40:53,122 --> 00:40:54,206
Who told you that?

502
00:40:57,459 --> 00:40:58,293
Cody.

503
00:41:02,381 --> 00:41:05,592
Easy, boys! Easy! Get him out!

504
00:41:06,176 --> 00:41:07,011
Easy!

505
00:41:12,933 --> 00:41:13,768
Cody!

506
00:41:15,185 --> 00:41:16,937
Watch his leg. Watch his leg.

507
00:41:40,044 --> 00:41:42,004
SOS. SOS.

508
00:41:42,087 --> 00:41:43,756
41.40.

509
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,925
Ice road north of 53.

510
00:41:46,008 --> 00:41:47,676
Kenworth through the ice.

511
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,593
Repeat.

512
00:41:48,677 --> 00:41:50,262
Kenworth through the ice.

513
00:41:50,345 --> 00:41:52,181
<i>Copy. Are there survivors?</i>

514
00:41:52,264 --> 00:41:53,223
Negative.

515
00:41:54,099 --> 00:41:55,893
<i>We are responding. Thank you.</i>

516
00:41:56,977 --> 00:41:59,814
Wait. What about us?

517
00:41:59,897 --> 00:42:01,106
What about us?

518
00:42:05,652 --> 00:42:07,237
We're heading back, right?

519
00:42:09,114 --> 00:42:10,032
Back?

520
00:42:10,532 --> 00:42:12,159
Yeah. That's what I said.

521
00:42:13,243 --> 00:42:15,955
The ice is bound to be thinner
to the south, not thicker.

522
00:42:16,038 --> 00:42:19,458
We still have two deliverable wellheads.
Technical redundancy, remember?

523
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:21,251
And we're more than halfway there.

524
00:42:21,836 --> 00:42:23,003
What do you think, Gurty?

525
00:42:25,255 --> 00:42:27,132
Attaboy. Are you coming with, Tantoo?

526
00:42:27,842 --> 00:42:28,675
Hell yeah.

527
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:31,553
But this is ridiculous.
You're all gonna die.

528
00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:34,849
You wanna go back, go back.
I suggest you do it quick.

529
00:42:37,893 --> 00:42:38,978
<i>Nichiiwad.</i>

530
00:42:39,061 --> 00:42:40,312
The big one.

531
00:42:40,813 --> 00:42:42,481
Drop 50 degrees.

532
00:42:42,564 --> 00:42:45,317
We'll pick up eight to ten centimeters
of new ice.

533
00:42:45,901 --> 00:42:49,613
Let's get the rigs upright and haul ass.
We're back in business.

534
00:42:49,696 --> 00:42:51,615
You're out of your minds. All of you!

535
00:42:52,407 --> 00:42:53,575
Wait, wait. Wait.

536
00:42:54,743 --> 00:42:58,038
- It appears you're the new leader here.
- I'm not the leader of anything.

537
00:42:58,122 --> 00:42:59,581
Everyone's on their own.

538
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:01,751
Fine. Whatever.

539
00:43:04,169 --> 00:43:06,881
You're not curious about back there,
what happened?

540
00:43:07,798 --> 00:43:10,968
- We saw what happened.
- I'm talking about the seized-up engine.

541
00:43:14,429 --> 00:43:15,514
Go on.

542
00:43:17,808 --> 00:43:20,310
How well do you know her? Tantoo?

543
00:43:20,394 --> 00:43:22,562
Met her first time yesterday. Why?

544
00:43:26,691 --> 00:43:28,693
Mind answering a couple questions?

545
00:43:30,362 --> 00:43:33,532
You worked for Jim Goldenrod,
what, two years?

546
00:43:34,324 --> 00:43:35,242
Two and a half.

547
00:43:37,369 --> 00:43:38,537
Why did it end?

548
00:43:40,414 --> 00:43:43,042
I used his rig on the weekend
without permission.

549
00:43:43,918 --> 00:43:46,170
- So, you're a thief.
- I'm not a thief.

550
00:43:47,296 --> 00:43:49,298
Hey, I was hauling banners for a demon...

551
00:43:51,633 --> 00:43:52,885
What is this your business?

552
00:43:52,968 --> 00:43:56,180
You weren't a happy camper, were you?
When he fired you?

553
00:43:57,181 --> 00:43:58,098
No, I...

554
00:43:58,182 --> 00:43:59,183
Look, just...

555
00:44:00,475 --> 00:44:04,188
I've never seen a Kenworth
with less than 10K on the odometer

556
00:44:04,271 --> 00:44:06,065
just up and quit, have you?

557
00:44:06,731 --> 00:44:07,566
No.

558
00:44:08,067 --> 00:44:12,196
Most diesel engines don't seize
on their own unless they burn gasoline.

559
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:15,324
What's this about?

560
00:44:15,407 --> 00:44:18,702
You dosed Goldenrod's rig
with gas while we were loading up.

561
00:44:18,786 --> 00:44:20,037
I saw you next to the pump.

562
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,122
You said you were checking
the tire pressure.

563
00:44:22,206 --> 00:44:23,791
That is a goddamn lie.

564
00:44:23,874 --> 00:44:26,418
You were gonna take us all out,
weren't you?

565
00:44:26,501 --> 00:44:28,503
So you could claim the whole 200 grand.

566
00:44:28,587 --> 00:44:31,173
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Who else, then?

567
00:44:31,256 --> 00:44:33,342
It wasn't me. Wasn't Gurty. Wasn't him.

568
00:44:33,843 --> 00:44:36,011
He works for the company that's paying us.

569
00:44:36,095 --> 00:44:38,555
This is not about the money for me,
you idiots!

570
00:44:38,638 --> 00:44:40,057
God, my brother is in that mine.

571
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,601
And the longer we stand here,
the closer he is to dying.

572
00:44:42,684 --> 00:44:44,019
So if you could just move...

573
00:44:44,103 --> 00:44:46,271
She's lying. You can't trust these people.

574
00:44:47,439 --> 00:44:49,691
Call Katka. His name is Cody Mantooth.

575
00:44:49,775 --> 00:44:51,151
We have different fathers.

576
00:44:51,819 --> 00:44:52,736
God, "These people"?

577
00:44:53,946 --> 00:44:56,490
- You're a racist asshole.
- You're not going anywhere.

578
00:44:56,573 --> 00:44:57,491
Just get out of...

579
00:44:57,574 --> 00:44:59,368
- You're not going anywhere.
- Fine.

580
00:44:59,451 --> 00:45:01,495
Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

581
00:45:11,463 --> 00:45:13,340
We call the company and check your story.

582
00:45:13,423 --> 00:45:15,175
Yeah, and then go fuck yourself.

583
00:45:15,885 --> 00:45:17,177
Tie her up, Gurty.

584
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,356
Yeah, Tully, it's Mike.

585
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,401
<i>I just heard about Goldenrod
from County Emergency. What happened?</i>

586
00:46:14,484 --> 00:46:17,696
We think Tantoo
dosed Jim's rig with gasoline.

587
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,157
<i>Are you kidding?
That's worse than sugar in the tank.</i>

588
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,533
Contact Katka.

589
00:46:22,117 --> 00:46:25,788
Ask 'em if there's a miner,
Cody Mantooth, on the missing list.

590
00:46:26,288 --> 00:46:28,207
- I'll explain later.
- <i>You got it.</i>

591
00:46:40,635 --> 00:46:42,262
We wanna discuss options.

592
00:46:42,346 --> 00:46:43,388
Like what?

593
00:46:44,348 --> 00:46:46,016
Like decreasing our numbers.

594
00:46:47,392 --> 00:46:50,604
I wanna talk to the folks upstairs.
I wanna talk to the bosses.

595
00:46:50,687 --> 00:46:52,147
You don't know tap code.

596
00:46:52,731 --> 00:46:53,732
He does.

597
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,651
You guys can't be serious.

598
00:46:59,363 --> 00:47:00,655
It's called triage.

599
00:47:00,739 --> 00:47:02,449
Hospitals do it all the time.

600
00:47:03,951 --> 00:47:07,287
If we decrease our numbers by one-third,
our oxygen window increases by...

601
00:47:07,371 --> 00:47:08,580
We can do the math.

602
00:47:09,581 --> 00:47:11,666
Hospitals are a bullshit analogy.

603
00:47:11,751 --> 00:47:15,379
Patients get triaged
when it's determined they'd die anyway.

604
00:47:16,797 --> 00:47:18,340
And what about these guys?

605
00:47:18,423 --> 00:47:20,675
They're not gonna make it till morning.

606
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,846
- No one's going for this.
- I agree. It's nuts.

607
00:47:25,597 --> 00:47:27,724
- Say you're wrong.
- Say we're not.

608
00:47:27,808 --> 00:47:29,101
Say we put it to a vote.

609
00:47:29,184 --> 00:47:30,560
What's he saying, Cody?

610
00:47:35,607 --> 00:47:38,986
- They wanna decrease our numbers.
- Can't be serious.

611
00:47:40,654 --> 00:47:42,072
Looks serious to me, Claude.

612
00:47:42,156 --> 00:47:44,741
Nobody wants this, Barney.
Don't make it personal.

613
00:47:44,825 --> 00:47:48,495
Hate to tell ya, friend.
This is about as personal as it gets.

614
00:47:48,578 --> 00:47:49,830
You guys seen yourselves?

615
00:47:49,914 --> 00:47:52,749
Barney, that compound fracture
has sepsis in it.

616
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:55,085
And you, Claude,
how's that fever treating ya?

617
00:47:55,585 --> 00:47:58,297
- You're not gonna make another 12 hours.
- What if we say no?

618
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,757
It's going to a vote.

619
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,843
That's like two foxes and a chicken
voting on what's for dinner.

620
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:05,345
I always knew you were a prick, Mankins.

621
00:48:06,013 --> 00:48:08,265
Didn't know until now
you're also a murderer.

622
00:48:19,234 --> 00:48:21,153
"Suggest decreasing our number."

623
00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:25,032
- What does that mean?
- They mean decreasing their number.

624
00:48:25,615 --> 00:48:26,450
Well, how?

625
00:48:26,533 --> 00:48:27,617
How do you think?

626
00:48:28,869 --> 00:48:29,703
No.

627
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:31,455
What? No.

628
00:48:32,247 --> 00:48:34,583
No, that's crazy.
I'm not taking part in this.

629
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:36,877
We're not calling the shots
down there, Fred.

630
00:48:46,053 --> 00:48:49,098
Hey, those trailers smacked down hard.

631
00:48:49,181 --> 00:48:51,516
Gurty and I are gonna go check the loads,

632
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,893
then we'll push on.

633
00:48:55,229 --> 00:48:56,313
How's she looking?

634
00:49:10,244 --> 00:49:11,161
Hey! Hey!

635
00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:13,455
- Hey!
- Help! Hey!

636
00:49:14,706 --> 00:49:17,752
- Open the damn door!
- Help!

637
00:49:20,796 --> 00:49:21,630
Hey!

638
00:49:32,391 --> 00:49:33,893
Open this damn door!

639
00:49:54,496 --> 00:49:55,664
It was you.

640
00:49:57,124 --> 00:49:59,501
You piece of shit.
"Insurance actuary" my ass.

641
00:49:59,584 --> 00:50:00,836
What do you do for Katka?

642
00:50:01,796 --> 00:50:05,758
Let's just say I work
in a different department of the company.

643
00:50:05,841 --> 00:50:07,009
Yeah, the sewer.

644
00:50:09,011 --> 00:50:11,555
Look, here's the rules.

645
00:50:12,765 --> 00:50:13,808
You behave yourself,

646
00:50:13,891 --> 00:50:17,227
and you can stay in the restraints
those idiot truckers put on you.

647
00:50:17,853 --> 00:50:19,897
But you get a little spirited,

648
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,565
which I know is a problem for

649
00:50:22,607 --> 00:50:23,608
you people,

650
00:50:24,109 --> 00:50:25,569
and I will hog-tie you

651
00:50:25,652 --> 00:50:27,196
and throw you in the rear.

652
00:50:42,544 --> 00:50:44,254
- Yeah?
- <i>Mike, what's your status?</i>

653
00:50:44,338 --> 00:50:47,299
- No, it's Varnay. We're stuck in a storm.
- <i>Got an answer on Cody Mantooth.</i>

654
00:50:47,382 --> 00:50:48,926
I can't talk.

655
00:50:54,389 --> 00:50:56,100
Please work. Please work.

656
00:51:02,147 --> 00:51:04,108
She's outfitted with a heater unit.

657
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:07,611
Hey, Gurty, how heavy
do we think this double mill pipe is?

658
00:51:08,278 --> 00:51:09,905
Five mill double hundred.

659
00:51:09,989 --> 00:51:10,906
Huh?

660
00:51:13,367 --> 00:51:15,535
Three, four, zero.

661
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,371
Three forty each?

662
00:51:17,955 --> 00:51:19,623
Grab hold of the end of this one.

663
00:51:20,875 --> 00:51:22,251
We're gonna punch that out.

664
00:51:22,752 --> 00:51:24,419
Punch pipe the pin post.

665
00:51:24,503 --> 00:51:26,046
My thoughts exactly.

666
00:52:05,169 --> 00:52:06,170
Easy.

667
00:52:06,921 --> 00:52:07,922
Easy.

668
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:16,055
Easy.

669
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:19,975
One, two, three.

670
00:52:27,942 --> 00:52:29,484
One, two, three.

671
00:52:38,994 --> 00:52:40,495
One, two, three.

672
00:52:42,957 --> 00:52:45,000
One, two, three.

673
00:53:47,855 --> 00:53:48,688
Yes!

674
00:53:52,401 --> 00:53:53,944
Oh, no, no, no!

675
00:53:56,655 --> 00:54:00,034
He took the phone,
the pistol, our gear bags.

676
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,202
And the Too.

677
00:54:02,787 --> 00:54:03,788
And the what?

678
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:06,331
Tantoo.

679
00:54:06,415 --> 00:54:08,083
Tantoo as well.

680
00:54:11,003 --> 00:54:12,379
Let's figure this out.

681
00:55:40,217 --> 00:55:41,718
What's the matter with you?

682
00:55:42,677 --> 00:55:43,971
Ease off!

683
00:56:08,078 --> 00:56:09,204
More!

684
00:56:09,288 --> 00:56:11,123
Hike up the pressure!

685
00:56:15,377 --> 00:56:16,253
Gurty!

686
00:56:16,879 --> 00:56:18,422
I said more!

687
00:56:19,006 --> 00:56:19,840
More!

688
00:56:22,592 --> 00:56:23,427
Jeez.

689
00:56:24,011 --> 00:56:25,429
I said more!

690
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:27,014
Mike!

691
00:56:27,097 --> 00:56:28,140
Yeah, I see it.

692
00:56:28,223 --> 00:56:29,641
It's called a winch.

693
00:56:29,724 --> 00:56:32,352
Mike, welding's a winter snap!

694
00:56:32,436 --> 00:56:33,270
What?

695
00:56:34,021 --> 00:56:35,815
Welding got cold!

696
00:56:37,149 --> 00:56:38,442
Just do it!

697
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:50,955
Do you know why we get fired?

698
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:55,000
It's not your disability.
It's your freaking attitude.

699
00:56:56,335 --> 00:56:59,546
You probably didn't take orders
before your disability.

700
00:57:04,927 --> 00:57:06,678
I don't know what's going on here,

701
00:57:07,596 --> 00:57:10,057
but that prick, he killed Goldenrod,

702
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:11,475
and he nearly killed us.

703
00:57:11,558 --> 00:57:13,602
He pinned it all on Tantoo,

704
00:57:13,685 --> 00:57:16,814
who's out here to save her brother,
and we helped him.

705
00:57:17,815 --> 00:57:19,066
We have one chance,

706
00:57:19,149 --> 00:57:22,652
one chance to get out of this
and make this right.

707
00:57:24,029 --> 00:57:26,656
And you're not gonna wreck it.
Not this time.

708
00:57:28,658 --> 00:57:31,161
Don't you dare touch that.

709
00:57:42,297 --> 00:57:43,966
Come on, come on, come on.

710
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:50,890
She's coming free.

711
00:58:01,441 --> 00:58:02,818
What the hell was that?

712
00:58:16,081 --> 00:58:17,666
Gurty? Gurty?

713
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,668
Gurty!

714
00:58:21,128 --> 00:58:21,962
Gurty?

715
00:58:22,712 --> 00:58:23,588
Gurty!

716
01:00:24,168 --> 01:00:25,878
Come on, Gurty. Come on.

717
01:00:25,961 --> 01:00:27,629
Breathe. Breathe.

718
01:00:28,213 --> 01:00:29,965
Come on, Gurty. Work with me here.

719
01:00:44,188 --> 01:00:45,773
Oh jeez.

720
01:00:49,568 --> 01:00:51,570
Gurty.

721
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:53,864
Gurty.

722
01:00:54,614 --> 01:00:55,532
Jesus.

723
01:00:56,325 --> 01:00:57,993
Here, pal. Here, pal.

724
01:00:58,493 --> 01:01:00,370
Here, pal. I got you. I got you.

725
01:01:00,996 --> 01:01:01,914
I got you.

726
01:01:03,207 --> 01:01:04,041
I got you.

727
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:07,795
Gurty, I'm sorry.

728
01:01:07,878 --> 01:01:09,046
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

729
01:01:09,129 --> 01:01:12,174
I'm sorry I hit you.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

730
01:01:12,257 --> 01:01:13,717
I'm sorry, Gurty.

731
01:01:18,848 --> 01:01:20,015
Mike.

732
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:26,814
Yeah. Sunken dreams, Gurty.

733
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:29,566
Sunken dreams.

734
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,987
Yeah. It's eating at me too.

735
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:38,367
Why would an employee
of the company that hired us

736
01:01:38,909 --> 01:01:39,952
sabotage…

737
01:01:44,999 --> 01:01:46,250
They want us to fail.

738
01:01:47,334 --> 01:01:49,503
That's it. They want us to fail.

739
01:01:49,586 --> 01:01:50,545
I didn't see it.

740
01:01:51,421 --> 01:01:54,842
I've been too wrapped up
in what's in this for us.

741
01:01:56,802 --> 01:01:58,303
Oh, now I'm angry.

742
01:02:00,722 --> 01:02:02,057
Let's get out of here.

743
01:02:03,642 --> 01:02:05,144
It's not about money now.

744
01:02:06,061 --> 01:02:07,312
This is personal.

745
01:02:38,218 --> 01:02:40,763
Should be 20 minutes to the shoreline.

746
01:03:07,622 --> 01:03:10,375
Rig two's in the lake 20 klicks due south.

747
01:03:11,001 --> 01:03:12,878
Took the mechanic and the driver with it.

748
01:03:13,712 --> 01:03:18,467
I told them not to store dynamite
in the trailer due to friction detonation,

749
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:20,886
but they had other ideas.

750
01:03:21,971 --> 01:03:23,055
Good.

751
01:03:23,138 --> 01:03:24,223
Good. That's good.

752
01:03:25,474 --> 01:03:26,516
How about the driver?

753
01:03:27,309 --> 01:03:29,269
Well, she's alive, sir.

754
01:03:35,234 --> 01:03:37,778
Put the cab
through that guardrail up there.

755
01:03:39,154 --> 01:03:41,573
Your story is she lost control.

756
01:03:42,324 --> 01:03:45,452
You dove for safety before it went over.
You clear?

757
01:03:46,411 --> 01:03:47,329
Clear, sir.

758
01:03:47,872 --> 01:03:50,665
The miners' oxygen window
closes in three hours,

759
01:03:50,749 --> 01:03:52,835
so the press is gonna be all over us.

760
01:03:53,794 --> 01:03:56,463
They need to be told our valiant rescue

761
01:03:56,546 --> 01:03:57,714
had a tragic end.

762
01:03:58,298 --> 01:03:59,884
I'll make it happen, sir.

763
01:03:59,967 --> 01:04:01,218
Good. Good.

764
01:04:02,594 --> 01:04:03,971
You call me when it's done.

765
01:04:27,577 --> 01:04:30,330
If you do this, it's on your head.

766
01:04:30,414 --> 01:04:32,124
You wanna blame someone? Blame management.

767
01:04:32,207 --> 01:04:33,834
What does management got to do with it?

768
01:04:35,252 --> 01:04:37,296
- All those in favor, raise your...
- Mankins!

769
01:04:38,672 --> 01:04:39,757
I asked you a question.

770
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,967
Because they made us cut
the damn sensors, René.

771
01:04:43,552 --> 01:04:44,594
They what?

772
01:04:45,512 --> 01:04:49,809
Claimed the new quotas were killing them,
so they… couldn't afford a shutdown.

773
01:04:50,684 --> 01:04:54,604
They said there was no chance
of gas pockets this far north.

774
01:04:55,272 --> 01:04:56,982
And they sweetened the deal.

775
01:04:57,066 --> 01:04:58,192
How much?

776
01:05:04,156 --> 01:05:06,283
Hundred dollars per man per month.

777
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:11,914
You turned off the gas sensors
for $100 a month?

778
01:05:11,997 --> 01:05:14,291
And anyone who blew the whistle
gets shitcanned.

779
01:05:14,374 --> 01:05:15,960
None of that matters now, René.

780
01:05:16,043 --> 01:05:17,920
Our oxygen is falling fast.

781
01:05:18,503 --> 01:05:21,548
There's a vote on the floor.
All those in favor, raise your hands.

782
01:05:22,674 --> 01:05:23,968
No.

783
01:05:26,053 --> 01:05:27,096
Hey!

784
01:05:27,637 --> 01:05:30,015
How much methane
do you think is in here now?

785
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:31,433
Huh?

786
01:05:32,184 --> 01:05:33,894
These men are not the enemy.

787
01:05:34,478 --> 01:05:35,562
The enemy's up there.

788
01:05:35,645 --> 01:05:38,732
Bullshit! The enemy's asphyxiation.

789
01:05:38,816 --> 01:05:42,361
We're getting out of here together,
or not at all.

790
01:05:42,444 --> 01:05:44,905
You're one stupid son of a bitch, René.

791
01:05:47,783 --> 01:05:48,951
You too, Cody.

792
01:05:50,035 --> 01:05:50,911
Maybe so,

793
01:05:52,121 --> 01:05:53,663
but this is how it's gonna be.

794
01:06:21,942 --> 01:06:22,860
Right here.

795
01:06:25,237 --> 01:06:26,238
Let's clear the road.

796
01:06:58,728 --> 01:06:59,980
Ow!

797
01:07:00,064 --> 01:07:01,606
Yeah, that's what I thought.

798
01:07:02,107 --> 01:07:04,985
You're never gonna get away with this.
There's gonna be an investigation.

799
01:07:05,569 --> 01:07:06,904
That's the plan.

800
01:07:15,871 --> 01:07:16,789
What is that?

801
01:07:31,804 --> 01:07:33,180
Ah!

802
01:08:08,298 --> 01:08:09,591
Thanks.

803
01:08:39,121 --> 01:08:40,247
Mayday! Mayday!

804
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:42,582
<i>Mayday! Come in! Anybody, come in!</i>

805
01:08:42,666 --> 01:08:43,751
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

806
01:08:44,334 --> 01:08:45,878
Mayday! Is anybody out there?

807
01:08:46,378 --> 01:08:47,712
<i>Tantoo, it's Mike.</i>

808
01:08:48,463 --> 01:08:50,800
We're coming up the pass. Where are you?

809
01:08:50,883 --> 01:08:52,301
Approaching the upper traverse.

810
01:08:52,384 --> 01:08:54,804
I got Varnay behind me with others.
They're all armed.

811
01:08:54,887 --> 01:08:57,681
<i>We've got two hours to get to Katka,
and I'm still pulling weight.</i>

812
01:08:57,765 --> 01:08:59,266
<i>They're gonna stop us.</i>

813
01:08:59,349 --> 01:09:00,684
Yeah, we figured.

814
01:09:00,768 --> 01:09:03,437
Cody always said they cut corners
with the methane regs.

815
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,440
Those bastards, they caused the cave-in.
Now they're trying to cover it up.

816
01:09:07,024 --> 01:09:10,152
Not gonna happen.
Just hang on. We're coming.

817
01:09:23,415 --> 01:09:26,460
Take 'em out
so it will pass forensics.

818
01:09:26,543 --> 01:09:27,920
No bullet holes.

819
01:09:28,003 --> 01:09:30,339
Do not discharge your weapons.

820
01:10:31,108 --> 01:10:31,942
What?

821
01:10:38,323 --> 01:10:39,366
Shit.

822
01:10:39,449 --> 01:10:42,327
Oh, come on. One more mile.
We can do one more mile. Come on.

823
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:47,041
Yeah, we can do it. Come on.

824
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:06,018
Pull over!

825
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:09,814
Pull over now!

826
01:11:09,897 --> 01:11:11,190
Pull over!

827
01:11:13,901 --> 01:11:16,570
If they were gonna shoot us,
they would've done it by now.

828
01:11:17,071 --> 01:11:19,406
Yeah. Good. Come on.

829
01:11:21,283 --> 01:11:22,534
Ready, bro?

830
01:11:24,703 --> 01:11:26,746
Pull over now!

831
01:14:38,147 --> 01:14:40,690
Well, don't just stand there. Let's go.

832
01:14:58,918 --> 01:15:00,585
Come on, come on. Don't stop. Don't stop.

833
01:15:00,669 --> 01:15:01,837
Don't you dare stop. Come on.

834
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:09,303
Don't do this to me. Don't...

835
01:15:09,386 --> 01:15:11,013
Don't. Don't do this.

836
01:15:12,014 --> 01:15:13,348
Come on, don't stop. Come on.

837
01:15:13,432 --> 01:15:15,100
Come on, you piece of shit, let's go.

838
01:15:15,851 --> 01:15:17,686
I didn't mean it! I didn't mean it!

839
01:15:42,711 --> 01:15:45,047
Don't think that I'm not gonna
use this on you!

840
01:15:50,552 --> 01:15:51,846
What's your game?

841
01:15:53,722 --> 01:15:56,016
Oh, what? Are you just gonna stand there?

842
01:15:57,768 --> 01:15:58,602
Yeah.

843
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:00,938
This is the last wellhead.

844
01:16:01,021 --> 01:16:04,649
What are you gonna do?
You gonna push it the rest of the way?

845
01:16:05,150 --> 01:16:09,321
If you're gonna make it to Katka
before your brother stops breathing,

846
01:16:10,364 --> 01:16:12,199
that's what you're gonna have to do.

847
01:16:17,537 --> 01:16:19,289
The other drivers are gonna come.

848
01:16:20,207 --> 01:16:21,917
The other drivers are dead.

849
01:17:05,085 --> 01:17:07,212
He ripped out my fuel equalizer.

850
01:17:07,296 --> 01:17:08,713
Gurty can fix that.

851
01:17:10,632 --> 01:17:12,217
We'll change out your fuel line

852
01:17:12,301 --> 01:17:14,845
and siphon enough juice
to get you down to Katka.

853
01:17:17,139 --> 01:17:18,057
Listen.

854
01:17:19,099 --> 01:17:19,975
We…

855
01:17:20,976 --> 01:17:22,727
we seriously misjudged you.

856
01:17:23,813 --> 01:17:24,646
Friends?

857
01:17:28,067 --> 01:17:28,901
Yeah.

858
01:18:40,014 --> 01:18:41,681
Hey, how long
you think this is gonna take?

859
01:18:41,766 --> 01:18:42,850
A couple of minutes.

860
01:18:42,933 --> 01:18:45,602
- I know you're anxious about your brother.
- Yeah.

861
01:18:45,685 --> 01:18:48,647
Cody's all I got, you know?
It's kinda like you and yours.

862
01:18:49,148 --> 01:18:49,982
Yeah.

863
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:54,319
Gurty's like that commercial.

864
01:18:55,279 --> 01:18:57,364
Takes a lickin' but keeps on tickin'.

865
01:19:51,877 --> 01:19:53,253
That last can should do it.

866
01:19:54,713 --> 01:19:56,841
He saved my life. Give him a treat.

867
01:20:09,394 --> 01:20:12,022
We can't stay here, and we can't back up.

868
01:20:12,522 --> 01:20:13,941
We'll have to outrun it.

869
01:20:14,024 --> 01:20:16,401
- You're dreaming.
- You got a better idea?

870
01:21:34,229 --> 01:21:35,105
Oh. Oh.

871
01:21:36,774 --> 01:21:38,275
- Oh…
- Uncouple the trailer.

872
01:21:38,358 --> 01:21:39,734
We got a wellhead to deliver.

873
01:21:50,162 --> 01:21:51,163
Oh jeez.

874
01:21:52,456 --> 01:21:54,333
It's not as bad as it looks.

875
01:21:57,169 --> 01:21:59,171
It's, uh…

876
01:21:59,254 --> 01:22:01,715
It looks pretty bad, kid.

877
01:22:02,591 --> 01:22:03,675
Just be fast about it.

878
01:22:04,718 --> 01:22:06,386
Like pulling out a wisdom tooth.

879
01:22:06,470 --> 01:22:09,473
A wisdom tooth?
Do I… do I look like a dentist?

880
01:22:09,556 --> 01:22:10,724
Aah!

881
01:22:12,184 --> 01:22:13,727
Good girl. Good girl.

882
01:22:13,811 --> 01:22:16,105
Breathe. Breathe.

883
01:22:16,188 --> 01:22:18,774
That's it. Good girl. Good girl.

884
01:22:18,858 --> 01:22:20,860
Gurty, come and help me!

885
01:22:22,778 --> 01:22:24,446
Good girl. Good girl.

886
01:22:25,948 --> 01:22:26,782
Come on.

887
01:22:34,623 --> 01:22:35,624
Hang tight.

888
01:22:36,208 --> 01:22:40,295
Gurty and I are gonna haul
your trailer off the cliff, hook up,

889
01:22:40,379 --> 01:22:41,713
and head to that mine.

890
01:22:42,923 --> 01:22:44,549
We still got 45 minutes.

891
01:22:45,467 --> 01:22:46,301
Yeah.

892
01:23:16,373 --> 01:23:20,002
Sir? Mine Safety down in Winnipeg
wants René's laptops.

893
01:23:20,085 --> 01:23:22,254
Fred, Mine Safety gets the laptops

894
01:23:22,337 --> 01:23:24,464
when I say
they get the laptops, all right?

895
01:23:24,548 --> 01:23:26,383
We got a goddamn CEO to worry about.

896
01:23:26,466 --> 01:23:29,261
Yeah, well, you can tell him yourself.
He'll be here in an hour.

897
01:23:32,932 --> 01:23:36,310
There is nothing in those e-mails
that implicates us.

898
01:23:37,477 --> 01:23:39,814
Everything was cash,
so there's no paper trail.

899
01:23:40,522 --> 01:23:44,819
To the authorities, this just looks
like another tragic mining accident.

900
01:23:49,073 --> 01:23:51,826
Right in the morning, we open Tunnel 6.

901
01:23:52,534 --> 01:23:53,786
We remove the bodies.

902
01:23:54,536 --> 01:23:57,331
We let the public hold
their ritual funerals.

903
01:23:57,414 --> 01:24:00,625
We weather the obligatory
"occupational hazard" debate.

904
01:24:02,169 --> 01:24:03,378
And we open back up.

905
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,006
Business as usual.

906
01:24:12,054 --> 01:24:14,556
Come on, Varnay, answer the goddamn phone.

907
01:25:04,982 --> 01:25:06,358
Look, Gurty, we did it.

908
01:25:06,441 --> 01:25:07,567
We did it!

909
01:25:25,585 --> 01:25:27,254
Mike. Mike.

910
01:27:16,530 --> 01:27:17,739
Give me that pistol!

911
01:27:19,825 --> 01:27:22,036
Gurty, you gotta take the wheel.

912
01:27:22,828 --> 01:27:24,204
Come on. You can do it.

913
01:27:34,131 --> 01:27:36,967
Do not stop
until you reach the mine, got it?

914
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:37,927
Do not stop.

915
01:27:40,846 --> 01:27:42,681
Hey. Kill him.

916
01:27:43,265 --> 01:27:44,892
Not for me, for my brother.

917
01:29:51,310 --> 01:29:52,937
I've done this a thousand times.

918
01:29:54,021 --> 01:29:56,065
Move. I can do it.

919
01:30:40,943 --> 01:30:42,152
Shit.

920
01:30:44,989 --> 01:30:45,990
Traction pads.

921
01:30:46,490 --> 01:30:47,491
Yes, go.

922
01:31:07,636 --> 01:31:08,846
Come on, come on, come on.

923
01:31:11,807 --> 01:31:13,600
Shit. Shit.

924
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:22,609
Gurty, the cables are snapping.
Let's go! Come on!

925
01:33:33,615 --> 01:33:34,992
Oh shit. Oh shit.

926
01:33:49,214 --> 01:33:51,050
Gurty, shut the gate!

927
01:34:18,618 --> 01:34:19,787
Gurty!

928
01:34:33,843 --> 01:34:34,718
Gurty?

929
01:34:55,865 --> 01:34:56,991
Gurty.

930
01:34:57,074 --> 01:34:57,992
Gurty!

931
01:35:01,661 --> 01:35:02,955
He saved the rig.

932
01:35:03,038 --> 01:35:04,206
Oh Jesus.

933
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:08,919
Mike… you… brother mine.

934
01:35:09,879 --> 01:35:11,881
My brother.

935
01:35:17,970 --> 01:35:19,513
Brother. Mine.

936
01:35:32,734 --> 01:35:36,864
No, no, no, no.

937
01:35:38,323 --> 01:35:39,283
No.

938
01:35:41,869 --> 01:35:42,912
I'm sorry.

939
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:46,581
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

940
01:35:47,332 --> 01:35:48,625
I'm so sorry.

941
01:35:56,842 --> 01:35:59,678
Deputy Minister, Jack Tager,
Vice President of Operations.

942
01:35:59,762 --> 01:36:01,180
George Sickle, General Manager.

943
01:36:01,263 --> 01:36:02,222
- Tager.
- Sir.

944
01:36:02,306 --> 01:36:03,682
- Sickle.
- How are you, sir?

945
01:36:03,766 --> 01:36:06,476
- It's cold up here.
- We have hot drink and food inside, sir.

946
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:09,271
How was that drive down
from Gillam Airfield?

947
01:36:09,354 --> 01:36:12,316
Cut the formalities, Sickle.
Tell me the situation.

948
01:36:13,984 --> 01:36:17,905
Our last contact
with the rescue team was 0300.

949
01:36:18,655 --> 01:36:20,115
Uh, Deputy Minister, how about you?

950
01:36:20,199 --> 01:36:22,742
Your, uh, your man in Winnipeg.
Heard anything?

951
01:36:23,243 --> 01:36:24,161
Negative.

952
01:36:24,244 --> 01:36:27,581
It's been 30 hours,
and the wellheads haven't arrived.

953
01:36:27,664 --> 01:36:30,542
I don't believe the men
are gonna get out of Tunnel 6 alive.

954
01:36:48,727 --> 01:36:49,686
What's that?

955
01:36:49,770 --> 01:36:51,772
That's our emergency Klaxon.

956
01:37:02,241 --> 01:37:03,242
Oh my God.

957
01:37:07,621 --> 01:37:09,623
Hey, welcome to Katka.

958
01:37:10,332 --> 01:37:11,166
You McCann?

959
01:37:11,834 --> 01:37:12,877
Yeah.

960
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,003
You need medical?

961
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:23,763
Everyone, on the double.
We still have a chance.

962
01:37:25,389 --> 01:37:27,724
We got another one.
We need a gurney, ASAP.

963
01:37:28,976 --> 01:37:29,977
There's no hurry.

964
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:33,856
Get that wellhead unloaded
and bolted down. Let's go.

965
01:37:33,939 --> 01:37:36,358
Straight to the drill site.
Go, go, go, go!

966
01:37:49,704 --> 01:37:51,040
Wellhead team! You're up!

967
01:38:17,566 --> 01:38:18,400
Got it!

968
01:38:19,193 --> 01:38:21,611
Wellhead is tapped and sprung.

969
01:38:21,695 --> 01:38:24,281
All right, blasting team,
Tunnel 6 on the double!

970
01:38:41,131 --> 01:38:43,217
- You're in no condition...
- I don't give a shit.

971
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:44,802
Put a Band-Aid on it. I heard blasting.

972
01:38:44,885 --> 01:38:46,887
- I'm gonna find Cody. What?
- Tantoo, Tantoo, Tantoo.

973
01:38:47,387 --> 01:38:50,933
We're outside the oxygen window.
We didn't make it in time.

974
01:38:51,016 --> 01:38:52,101
Don't say that.

975
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:55,855
Look, Gurty died
so that the miners would live, okay?

976
01:38:55,938 --> 01:38:58,398
My brother is alive.
I'm gonna find him. Let's go.

977
01:39:10,119 --> 01:39:11,536
Someone's coming out!

978
01:39:37,104 --> 01:39:37,980
Cody?

979
01:39:47,114 --> 01:39:47,990
Cody?

980
01:39:48,866 --> 01:39:49,784
Oh my God.

981
01:39:52,161 --> 01:39:53,412
You're alive. Oh my God.

982
01:39:54,121 --> 01:39:55,414
You saved my life.

983
01:39:58,375 --> 01:39:59,376
I had help.

984
01:40:01,711 --> 01:40:02,712
Thank you.

985
01:40:18,353 --> 01:40:19,438
All right!

986
01:40:23,525 --> 01:40:24,651
You paid them?

987
01:40:27,112 --> 01:40:29,865
You paid them to shut off their sensors?

988
01:40:36,538 --> 01:40:37,832
You're disgusting.

989
01:41:02,397 --> 01:41:03,232
Mr. McCann?

990
01:41:04,316 --> 01:41:06,735
I'm Deputy Minister
of Natural Resources for Canada.

991
01:41:07,486 --> 01:41:10,990
I wanna thank you
and offer condolences for your brother.

992
01:41:11,573 --> 01:41:13,700
The company has
some papers for you to sign.

993
01:41:13,784 --> 01:41:16,328
We have a check for you.
And the police need your statement.

994
01:41:21,625 --> 01:41:22,960
Excuse me, Mr. McCann?

995
01:41:23,961 --> 01:41:26,088
We found this with your brother's things.

996
01:41:38,517 --> 01:41:39,393
Thank you.

997
01:42:14,804 --> 01:42:15,846
- Hey!
- Hey.

998
01:42:18,808 --> 01:42:20,810
- Brand-new Kenworth, huh?
- Yep.

999
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:22,477
It's a good color.

1000
01:42:22,561 --> 01:42:23,813
In honor of Jim.

1001
01:42:24,479 --> 01:42:25,480
What you hauling?

1002
01:42:26,315 --> 01:42:27,691
- Sporting goods.
- Oh.

1003
01:42:28,483 --> 01:42:30,277
- Ain't that the life?
- Yep.

1004
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:32,822
No bosses, no punching time clocks.

1005
01:42:32,905 --> 01:42:34,406
- Good pay rates.
- Yeah.

1006
01:42:34,990 --> 01:42:37,326
Well, you find yourself
pining for the ice road,

1007
01:42:37,409 --> 01:42:38,618
you know where to find me.

1008
01:42:38,702 --> 01:42:39,536
Deal.

1009
01:42:43,748 --> 01:42:44,708
Thank you, Mike.
