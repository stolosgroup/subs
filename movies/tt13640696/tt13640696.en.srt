<i>Agatha Christie's</i> The Mousetrap.

3
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:11,136
<i>In my opinion, a
second-rate murder mystery.</i>

4
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:13,471
<i>Not that I've seen
it, you understand.</i>

5
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,407
<i>But it's a whodunit.</i>

6
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,579
<i>You've seen one,
you've seen 'em all.</i>

7
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:21,581
<i>You know the drill.</i>

8
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:22,949
<i>An interminable prologue</i>

9
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:26,151
<i>in which all the key
players are introduced.</i>

10
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:28,821
<i>You get a sense of the
world they inhabit,</i>

11
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:32,457
<i>and then the most unlikable
character gets bumped off.</i>

12
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,660
There's been a murder?

13
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:37,730
<i>Cue the entrance of a
world-weary detective,</i>

14
00:01:37,732 --> 00:01:41,366
<i>who comes in and
pokes his nose around.</i>

15
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:44,837
<i>Talks to witnesses. Takes
a couple of wrong turns.</i>

16
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:48,574
<i>And then gathers all the
suspects in the drawing room</i>

17
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:51,209
<i>and points the finger at
the least likely chump</i>

18
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,411
<i>because of the way the guy,</i>

19
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,914
<i>I don't know,</i>

20
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,749
<i>ties his shoelaces.</i>

21
00:01:56,751 --> 00:02:01,319
Now you've seen our play,
you're an accomplice to murder.

22
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,724
And so, we ask you to remember

23
00:02:04,726 --> 00:02:07,627
that it is very much
in your interests

24
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:12,364
not to tell a soul outside
of this theater who done it.

25
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:15,534
<i>But what do I know?</i>

26
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:18,336
<i>The Limeys, they just lap it up.</i>

27
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,506
<i>The play's a smash hit.</i>

28
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:22,842
<i>Not to mention a cash cow.</i>

29
00:02:22,844 --> 00:02:27,381
<i>Right there is the milkmaid
in chief, Petula Spencer.</i>

30
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:50,803
<i>This lavish affair is a party to
celebrate the 100th performance.</i>

31
00:02:50,805 --> 00:02:52,772
<i>No wonder film
producer John Woolf</i>

32
00:02:52,774 --> 00:02:56,274
<i>wants to turn the play into
a major motion picture.</i>

33
00:02:56,276 --> 00:03:00,345
<i>Here he is now in the arms of
his slightly paranoid wife.</i>

34
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:03,381
I sense that death
is close at hand.

35
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,618
It's probably just a draft.

36
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,620
<i>This is where I come in.</i>

37
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:09,722
<i>Leo Kopernick's the name.</i>

38
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:12,525
<i>Big-shot Hollywood director.</i>

39
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:14,694
<i>Hired to make the
film adaptation</i>

40
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:18,329
<i>marginally less
boring than the play.</i>

41
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:22,935
<i>Easier said than done when the
writer's a giant pompous ass.</i>

42
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:25,270
<i>Mervyn Cocker-Norris.</i>

43
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,006
I say, you're rather tall.

44
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:29,542
Am I? Haven't really thought
about it, to be honest.

45
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:31,610
Is that what happened here?

46
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:33,913
Sort of. I had a bit of
an accident backstage.

47
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:38,017
<i>Sure, he's educated and he
knows a lot of $10 words,</i>

48
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:40,886
<i>but it's like he's never
seen a film before,</i>

49
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,855
<i>let alone try to write one.</i>

50
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:44,592
Oh, <i>ma vattinne!</i>

51
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,528
<i>Chi e chistu?</i>

52
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:49,562
No one important.

53
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:51,964
<i>Omm, femmina o bestia,
basta che respira!</i>

54
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:55,435
You know, at times you do rather
overdo the temperamental Neapolitan.

55
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,805
That's a nice jacket.

56
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:04,476
Say, why don't you scare me up
a real drink, will you, kid?

57
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:09,449
Like a pint of rye or bourbon
or motor oil, if you have to.

58
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,417
Yeah. Hop to it, now, huh?

59
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,521
<i>In England, that actually
counts as good service.</i>

60
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:17,523
<i>I was stationed
here during the war</i>

61
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:20,593
<i>and, if anything, the
locals are more uptight now</i>

62
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:23,028
<i>than when they had the
Luftwaffe overhead.</i>

63
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,397
Mervyn?

64
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:26,832
Shouldn't you be home?

65
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,333
I thought we had a deadline.

66
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,535
I thought so too.

67
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:32,337
But then our esteemed director
tore up the screenplay

68
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,673
and told me to start
all over again.

69
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:37,676
He's of the opinion that a modern
audience will walk out in protest

70
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:41,614
if they're not served at least one
violent death in the opening frames.

71
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:44,652
Suffice to say, we are no
longer on speaking terms.

72
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,352
Merv!

73
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:50,856
London's most sensitive writer.

74
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:52,525
How is <i>The Mousetrap,</i> huh?

75
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:53,993
Did they catch the
guy who did it?

76
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:56,363
I will not stand
here and be insulted.

77
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:59,865
Well, I guess he's gonna go
over there and be insulted.

78
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,700
Huh.

79
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:05,571
<i>What passes for
glamour in these parts.</i>

80
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:08,707
<i>Sheila Sim and
Dickie Attenborough.</i>

81
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:11,376
<i>Kid likes the sound
of his own voice.</i>

82
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,478
<i>Even money, he makes a speech.</i>

83
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,581
I suppose I ought
to say a few words.

84
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,582
Not too many.

85
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:19,384
And when have I ever?
Our wedding, remember?

86
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:20,686
We almost missed the honeymoon.

87
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:21,787
Yes.

88
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:23,856
Darlings, you're ever so kind.

89
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:27,893
I'd like to ask you all to
raise a metaphorical bat

90
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:29,628
to the old pavilion.

91
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,565
<i>The Mousetrap</i> is 100, not out.

92
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:34,035
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

93
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,070
<i>I tell you what
else is 100 not out.</i>

94
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:39,972
<i>Petula's mother.</i>

95
00:05:39,974 --> 00:05:43,509
<i>The old kook's just
crazy about seafood.</i>

96
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,644
They just brought out
more langoustines.

97
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:51,016
Excuse me, I just need
to deal with that.

98
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,117
Mother! Please,

99
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:53,484
you've had quite enough. Hi.

100
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,655
<i>Now, I'm not one to tell
tales out of school,</i>

101
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:58,757
<i>but the girls over here,</i>

102
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,126
<i>they go wild for
an American accent</i>

103
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:03,598
<i>and the promise of
a pair of nylons.</i>

104
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,631
<i>But the husbands...</i>

105
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:08,100
Right. I think it's time
someone taught you a lesson.

106
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:09,902
<i>They're not so easily won over.</i>

107
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:12,838
It's only fair to warn you that
I learned to box in the RAF.

108
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,977
Yeah? Well, I learned to fly
a plane in Gleason's Gym.

109
00:06:21,015 --> 00:06:26,018
<i>All of which explains, in an
admittedly roundabout fashion,</i>

110
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,021
<i>how I come to be in the
theater's backstage area</i>

111
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:31,092
<i>in need of a change of clothes.</i>

112
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:44,972
Hello?

113
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:18,572
Hello?

114
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:18,265
Aw, jeez.

115
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:23,669
<i>I guess I should have
seen this coming.</i>

116
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:27,106
<i>It's always the most unlikable
character who gets bumped off.</i>

117
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,143
<i>It's a whodunit.</i>

118
00:08:31,145 --> 00:08:34,013
<i>You've seen one,
you've seen 'em all.</i>

119
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:12,019
We're closed.

120
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:16,023
Clear off.

121
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,628
Honestly.

122
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:27,299
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.
Inspector, uh, Stoppard, sir.

123
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:30,069
Sorry, I was under strict
instructions not to let anyone in.

124
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:31,236
Just open the door.

125
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,238
Yes, sir. Of course. Sorry,
I didn't recognize you, sir.

126
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,674
I've actually, uh, just
been transferred myself.

127
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:38,343
Thought it was Leeke and
Priestley on rotation tonight.

128
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:40,214
Careful, sir.

129
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:41,947
In you come.

130
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:50,691
Constable. Stalker, sir.

131
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:53,892
God, you're all
wet through, sir.

132
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,894
Hope you don't catch
a cold after that.

133
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:57,031
Yep, after you, sir.

134
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:03,902
Victim's name is Leo Kopernick,
sir. The film director.

135
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:06,138
Suspected Communist,
blacklisted in Hollywood,

136
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,808
so he came out here to work
on a picture for John Woolf.

137
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,777
You know John Woolf,
the film producer.

138
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:14,146
He made <i>The African Queen</i>
with Humphrey Bogart.

139
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:15,747
"Nature, Mr. Allnut,

140
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:18,917
"is what we are put in
this world to rise above."

141
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,919
That didn't sound
anything like Bogart.

142
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:23,388
No, that was Katharine
Hepburn, sir. She's in it too.

143
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,923
Wonderful actress.

144
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,059
I go to the pictures
quite a lot, actually.

145
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:28,427
It's the escape, I suppose.

146
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:29,828
The romance of
the silver screen.

147
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,896
Yes, thank you, Constable.

148
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:32,032
Yes, sir.

149
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:58,290
Eh, signs of a struggle.

150
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:00,092
Actually, sir, I
believe that happened

151
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:01,426
when Mrs. Boyle was killed.

152
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:02,961
Mrs. Boyle? Who's...

153
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:05,063
Yes, sir. Um...

154
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:06,625
She's that woman in
the front row there.

155
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:11,105
Well, she seems to
have bounced back.

156
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:13,238
Oh.

157
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,341
Sorry, sir. No, she was killed
in the play. Also strangled.

158
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,310
Not that I've seen it,
although I would like to.

159
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:21,747
It's an Agatha Christie,
and I do like a good murder.

160
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:23,749
Yes, thank you, Constable.

161
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:24,785
Yes, sir.

162
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,361
A ski did that, sir.

163
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,363
They use it in the
play, apparently.

164
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,766
As I said, I haven't seen it.

165
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:44,303
And then the large dent in the
cranium is a sewing machine.

166
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:46,772
Seems he was killed in the
costume store initially,

167
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:48,409
and then he was deposited here.

168
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:52,246
Staged, so to speak.

169
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:55,783
Sorry, sir.

170
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:06,258
Yeah, that's the ski that
he took in the face, sir.

171
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,963
And, uh, I'm afraid it
was downhill from there.

172
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:12,097
Oh. Sorry, sir.

173
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:13,867
That one just came
out on its own.

174
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:22,941
Seems he came down here

175
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:23,978
for a change of clothes.

176
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:27,281
Why?

177
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:36,822
It was a party to celebrate
the 100th performance, sir.

178
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:38,056
The other nought must have...

179
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:41,059
When the victim
upset the sponge.

180
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:45,565
Um, and he then proceeded to sit
in the assortment of crustaceans.

181
00:12:52,006 --> 00:12:55,941
I'm told he was
intoxicated, sir, as a newt.

182
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:58,846
This was actually a lot more
fun than I thought it would be.

183
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:08,086
Then he left. No one saw him again
until the body was discovered.

184
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:09,223
That's correct, sir.

185
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:13,193
Perhaps they were all
in on it together, sir?

186
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,332
Hmm.

187
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:33,178
Looks like the killer tried to
pull out the victim's tongue.

188
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,881
Why would anyone do
a thing like that?

189
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:38,417
Excuse me, Chief Inspector.

190
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:39,585
It's just "Inspector."

191
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:41,920
Yes. Of course. Inspector.

192
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:43,589
I hate to interrupt, I do.

193
00:13:43,591 --> 00:13:44,657
There really is nothing worse...

194
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:47,527
Petula Spencer, sir.
Prominent theater impresario.

195
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:48,894
Yes, thank you, Constable.

196
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:52,964
Tell me, how much longer do you
intend to keep us all hostage here?

197
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,199
Or is that the idea?

198
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,902
"Let the galled jade wince."

199
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:58,236
Gather all the
suspects under one roof

200
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:01,239
and then interrogate each of us in
turn until the mystery is solved?

201
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,342
Mervyn Cocker-Norris,
overrated playwright.

202
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:05,045
Celebrated playwright.

203
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,212
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

204
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:09,014
I can't read me own handwriting.

205
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,218
Not that we are
suspects, necessarily.

206
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:14,922
Are we suspects?

207
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,524
It was just a reference
to Agatha Christie

208
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:20,492
and her penchant for denouement,

209
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:23,063
in which the detective
gathers the susp...

210
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:26,198
I dare say, that's not...

211
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,300
Please continue. Yes,
thank you, Mervyn.

212
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:30,235
Inspector, I want you to know

213
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:33,171
that I have nothing
but the utmost respect

214
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,207
for the Metropolitan Police.

215
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:37,442
But, well, do you think
you might be finished

216
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:39,111
in time for curtain
up tomorrow night?

217
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:40,245
Oh, for goodness' sake.

218
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,080
John Woolf, esteemed
film producer.

219
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:43,382
Yes, thank you, Constable.

220
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:45,350
This is a murder investigation.

221
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:48,987
Surely that takes
precedence, sold out or not.

222
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,123
Yes, it's all going to plan
for you, isn't it, Woolfie?

223
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,457
You want the run to end.

224
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:55,026
I want nothing of the sort.

225
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,562
It's the decent thing
to do, that's all.

226
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:59,231
Close the theater out
of respect for Leo.

227
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:00,533
Such a tragic loss.

228
00:15:00,535 --> 00:15:06,204
Inspector, I implore
you not to overreact.

229
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:09,141
I would hate to have to
go over your head and

230
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:11,644
talk directly to your superiors.

231
00:15:11,646 --> 00:15:13,513
Oh, we wouldn't want that,
now, would we, madam?

232
00:15:13,515 --> 00:15:15,548
But I'm afraid that
under the circumstances,

233
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,619
as a precaution... Precaution?

234
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:20,051
He's already dead.

235
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,587
He is, madam.

236
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:24,122
But until we have an idea
as to a likely motive,

237
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,291
who's to say this
is the end of it?

238
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,293
What is that supposed to mean?

239
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:31,062
We are no longer
merely suspects.

240
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:34,001
We are also potential victims.

241
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:36,671
Oh.

242
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:38,704
Mmm.

243
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:41,609
Oh, God, I wasn't in that,
was I? I must look dreadful.

244
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:08,135
Excuse me, sir.

245
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,144
Stoppard!

246
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,146
My office.

247
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:23,281
Hello, sir.

248
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:24,550
What in God's name possessed you

249
00:16:24,552 --> 00:16:26,384
to close down the Ambassadors?

250
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,086
Uh, protocol, sir.
It's a crime scene.

251
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:31,389
No, it's a public relations
disaster, is what it is.

252
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:32,525
Public what, sir?

253
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:33,793
Stalker! Sir.

254
00:16:33,795 --> 00:16:35,761
Not to put too
fine a point on...

255
00:16:35,763 --> 00:16:36,829
Yes, please. Here.

256
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:38,731
Not to put too fine a
point on it, Inspector,

257
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:42,400
but your latest blunder
is front page news.

258
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:43,669
Fleet Street is all over this,

259
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:45,605
like hot jam on a
Devonshire scone.

260
00:16:45,607 --> 00:16:49,307
You are slap-bang
in the crosshairs.

261
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:50,776
Now, we need to do
everything we can

262
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:53,679
to make sure the bullet
doesn't miss you and hit me.

263
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:55,648
Yeah, of course,
sir. Yes. Good.

264
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,617
Then you'll inform
the theater at once.

265
00:16:57,619 --> 00:16:59,384
Well, I thought as
a precaution, I...

266
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:00,786
The Home Secretary

267
00:17:00,788 --> 00:17:03,656
is a close, personal
friend of Agatha Christie.

268
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:06,091
His brother-in-law
is Rex Harrison.

269
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:07,158
Wonderful actor.

270
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,694
Yes, thank you,
Constable. Sir.

271
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:11,363
It's actually worked in our favor to
have the press distracted like this.

272
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:14,767
It means we can keep a lid on
the Rillington Place murders.

273
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:17,837
Rillington Place murders.
Yes. What's that?

274
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,672
Blimey.

275
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:21,541
Haven't you heard?

276
00:17:21,543 --> 00:17:23,643
We have a serial
killer on the loose.

277
00:17:23,645 --> 00:17:26,146
You didn't think all of this
was for you, now, did you?

278
00:17:27,782 --> 00:17:29,381
No, of course... No.

279
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:31,651
Of course not.

280
00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:35,320
Well, have all the resources been
allocated to this other investigation?

281
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:37,790
No, not all of them, no.

282
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:40,860
I understand you, uh, met
WPC Stalker last night?

283
00:17:40,862 --> 00:17:42,294
I did, yes.

284
00:17:42,296 --> 00:17:43,796
Constable. Inspector.

285
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:47,867
A very capable officer.

286
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:50,505
Or at least she will be once
she gets the proper instruction.

287
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,138
Sorry, sir, I'm
not sure I, uh...

288
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,372
You don't mean you want me to...

289
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:57,242
Yes, I do. I'd like you
to show her the ropes.

290
00:17:57,244 --> 00:18:00,880
I'm hoping some of her enthusiasm
for police work might rub off on you.

291
00:18:00,882 --> 00:18:03,181
But the, uh, bullet,
sir. Is that why...

292
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:05,685
This is not a debate, Stoppard.

293
00:18:05,687 --> 00:18:08,554
I have a reputation
as a modernizer.

294
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:10,623
I have to be seen to keep it up.

295
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,458
I have said in public

296
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,629
that I think women are
the future of the force.

297
00:18:16,631 --> 00:18:19,632
Absolutely, sir, I agree.

298
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:20,733
But we're not looking

299
00:18:20,735 --> 00:18:22,233
for stolen sweets... Sweets.

300
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,836
Or a lost bleeding bicycle.

301
00:18:23,838 --> 00:18:26,606
This is a murder investigation,
and she is inexperienced.

302
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:30,610
They were inexperienced
in the war.

303
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:32,745
Ask Jerry how that turned out.

304
00:18:32,747 --> 00:18:34,279
Yes, sir. But, uh...

305
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:35,380
That... Huh?

306
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:38,586
Will be all. Thank you.

307
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:40,622
Commissioner. Inspector.

308
00:18:41,723 --> 00:18:43,725
Constable. Inspector.

309
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:46,926
Commissioner. Constable.

310
00:18:46,928 --> 00:18:49,327
Um, sorry again about
last night, sir.

311
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,462
With the rain and everything...

312
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:52,304
Water under the bridge,
Constable. No harm done.

313
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:00,640
You all right?

314
00:19:00,642 --> 00:19:04,844
Yeah. Do we have an
address for the victim?

315
00:19:04,846 --> 00:19:09,216
Yep. It is "Laurel
Canyon, Hollywood, USA."

316
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:13,220
Where was he staying
in England, Constable?

317
00:19:14,522 --> 00:19:16,221
Oh. Um...

318
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:17,823
Right.

319
00:19:38,646 --> 00:19:41,246
If I am honest,
<i>Monsieur</i> Kopernick,

320
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:42,915
he was not a very good guest.

321
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:43,949
In arrears, was he?

322
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:47,720
<i>La, non,</i> but he did
not pay for his room.

323
00:19:47,722 --> 00:19:49,254
<i>Monsieur</i> Woolf did.

324
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:50,256
Hmm.

325
00:19:51,693 --> 00:19:53,628
What part of France
are you from, sir?

326
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:55,563
Belgium.

327
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,264
Ah, right.

328
00:20:03,638 --> 00:20:05,773
Oh, my, my.

329
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:10,275
What a bloody pigsty.

330
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:12,945
They don't clean the
rooms at the Savoy?

331
00:20:12,947 --> 00:20:14,949
<i>Helas,</i> not this one.

332
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,849
Hmm.

333
00:20:16,851 --> 00:20:19,317
The maids, they refuse.

334
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:22,890
We offer them more money,
but still they say <i>non.</i>

335
00:20:23,825 --> 00:20:24,992
There was

336
00:20:25,927 --> 00:20:28,561
an incident.

337
00:20:28,563 --> 00:20:32,399
Always <i>avec Monsieur</i> Kopernick,
there was an incident.

338
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,306
Hmm.

339
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:52,419
Ooh.

340
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,787
Thank you, Constable.

341
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:56,922
Oh. Sorry, sir.

342
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:59,426
Did one of these incidents
ever turn violent?

343
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:02,360
<i>Oui. Une fois.</i>

344
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:05,831
How dare you call
me a bad writer!

345
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,133
I didn't say that. I
said it's bad writing.

346
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:09,902
I did the best I could within
the confines of the genre,

347
00:21:09,904 --> 00:21:11,504
and Woolf loved it!

348
00:21:11,506 --> 00:21:13,973
Woolf wouldn't know a good script if
it came up and bit him on the ass.

349
00:21:13,975 --> 00:21:16,675
It's horseshit! No, it
isn't! Not all of it!

350
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:17,877
All right, what I
read is horseshit!

351
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:20,846
You mean you didn't
even finish it?

352
00:21:20,848 --> 00:21:21,947
I read enough, pal,

353
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:23,749
to know that nobody gets
killed in the first 10 pages!

354
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:25,918
You charlatan! Give it back!

355
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,520
Listen. Listen to
me. Listen! Give...

356
00:21:27,522 --> 00:21:29,454
We need to go in a completely
different direction!

357
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:40,067
I'll kill you for this,
Kopernick, you bastard!

358
00:21:43,671 --> 00:21:46,739
That's that then, sir. It's
as good as a confession.

359
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:49,409
Let's not jump to
conclusions, Constable.

360
00:21:49,677 --> 00:21:51,010
No, sir.

361
00:21:51,012 --> 00:21:53,612
The least we can do is
talk to this other party.

362
00:21:53,614 --> 00:21:55,482
Yes, sir. Cocker-Norris, sir.

363
00:21:57,952 --> 00:21:59,618
Tell me, do you
write everything down

364
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,754
in that little notebook?

365
00:22:01,756 --> 00:22:03,856
Only if it's important, sir.

366
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:05,593
How do you know
if it's important?

367
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:08,794
Well,

368
00:22:08,796 --> 00:22:12,698
uh, I'll just sort of put
everything in as we go,

369
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,967
and then down the line when
we know what's important,

370
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:17,004
we'll know that it's
already in the notebook.

371
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:21,507
So you do write everything down.

372
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:22,643
Yeah, everything.

373
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,645
That's what I thought.

374
00:22:37,124 --> 00:22:38,557
Make yourself comfortable.

375
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,761
You're just in
time for elevenses.

376
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:03,450
Oh.

377
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:14,629
Oh!

378
00:23:21,602 --> 00:23:24,203
You must excuse the <i>desordre,</i>

379
00:23:24,205 --> 00:23:26,505
it's research for
the film adaptation.

380
00:23:26,507 --> 00:23:29,775
Police statements, court
reports, newspaper cuttings.

381
00:23:29,777 --> 00:23:32,179
<i>The Mousetrap</i> is actually
based on a real-life case.

382
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,513
Nettle tea?

383
00:23:34,515 --> 00:23:37,482
I appreciate you've not yet
had time to come to terms

384
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:38,851
with the death of
Mr. Kopernick, but...

385
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:40,786
Is it true his tongue
was pulled out?

386
00:23:40,788 --> 00:23:42,655
I'm afraid I can't
divulge details

387
00:23:42,657 --> 00:23:43,722
of an ongoing investigation.

388
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:44,924
It was disgusting.

389
00:23:44,926 --> 00:23:47,826
<i>Amore, non pozzo fatica cosi!</i>

390
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:48,896
What?

391
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,697
<i>E na cos' 'e pazz!</i>

392
00:23:59,006 --> 00:24:03,575
That's Gio. Nephew of
mine. Very hotheaded.

393
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:05,210
I wonder if it
isn't all the fumes.

394
00:24:05,212 --> 00:24:06,779
You know, from the chemicals.

395
00:24:06,781 --> 00:24:09,014
He's an amateur taxidermist.

396
00:24:09,016 --> 00:24:12,584
He has a fascination
with the macabre.

397
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:14,522
I call it his
Stymphalian Bird series.

398
00:24:14,822 --> 00:24:16,188
Hmm.

399
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,660
Macabre in a strictly
"ornithological" sense, that is.

400
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,530
You wanted to ask me about Leo?

401
00:24:24,532 --> 00:24:26,899
We heard there was an
argument at the Savoy,

402
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:28,661
and I noticed you had
the other half of this.

403
00:24:34,642 --> 00:24:37,810
Inspector, that was a
<i>contretemps,</i> nothing more.

404
00:24:37,812 --> 00:24:40,245
Read that part. Yeah.

405
00:24:40,247 --> 00:24:43,651
"I'll kill you for this,
Kopernick, you bastard."

406
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:48,153
Well, obviously, I...

407
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:50,089
Taken out of context, I...

408
00:24:50,091 --> 00:24:54,827
Those words were spoken in anger
and under extreme provocation.

409
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:57,098
We had creative
differences, that's all.

410
00:24:57,898 --> 00:24:59,565
Hmm.

411
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:01,068
How did you like <i>The Mousetrap?</i>

412
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:03,669
Oh, yeah, the play? Mmm.

413
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:05,604
Yeah, I, uh... I
didn't see it yet.

414
00:25:05,606 --> 00:25:06,672
Well, if you'd like,

415
00:25:06,674 --> 00:25:07,873
I can precis
this... No, no, no.

416
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,576
I got the basics. It's
a whodunit, right?

417
00:25:10,578 --> 00:25:14,246
So, you got a dead
body, a detective,

418
00:25:14,248 --> 00:25:17,182
and then all the suspects
rather conveniently

419
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:19,587
end up in a remote
country house together.

420
00:25:19,987 --> 00:25:21,353
In a nutshell.

421
00:25:21,355 --> 00:25:24,590
Our task will be to present
this improbable series of events

422
00:25:24,592 --> 00:25:26,325
to an audience of
moderate intelligence

423
00:25:26,327 --> 00:25:28,994
in a manner that does not
cause too much offense.

424
00:25:28,996 --> 00:25:30,596
Easy.

425
00:25:30,598 --> 00:25:31,766
Flashbacks.

426
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:33,701
No.

427
00:25:34,168 --> 00:25:35,601
No what?

428
00:25:35,603 --> 00:25:37,202
No flashbacks.

429
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:39,171
<i>They are crass, lazy,
and they interrupt</i>

430
00:25:39,173 --> 00:25:40,472
the flow of the story.

431
00:25:40,474 --> 00:25:44,145
In my opinion, they are the last
refuge of a moribund imagination.

432
00:25:44,712 --> 00:25:45,644
Whatever next?

433
00:25:45,646 --> 00:25:48,180
A caption that says,
"Three weeks later"?

434
00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:54,219
Merv. Merv, will you come on?

435
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:55,754
This is crazy. Will
you open the door?

436
00:25:55,756 --> 00:25:57,356
I'm not coming out
until Woolf gets here.

437
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:01,193
What is it this time?

438
00:26:01,195 --> 00:26:02,795
I'll tell you what it is.

439
00:26:02,797 --> 00:26:04,029
I pitched a new ending,

440
00:26:04,031 --> 00:26:06,965
Cockamamie-Novice over here
locks himself in the bathroom.

441
00:26:06,967 --> 00:26:08,801
Is this instead
of the car chase?

442
00:26:08,803 --> 00:26:09,968
As well as.

443
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:14,006
I think he thinks "denouement"
is French for "shootout."

444
00:26:14,008 --> 00:26:15,674
Will you at least
hear me out first,

445
00:26:15,676 --> 00:26:18,043
and then tell me
you don't like it?

446
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:21,847
Come on, I storyboarded it
for you. Come on, have a seat.

447
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:25,050
Why can't we just have the detective
gather everyone in the drawing room

448
00:26:25,052 --> 00:26:27,386
and then reveal to
them who did it?

449
00:26:27,388 --> 00:26:30,656
Why? 'Cause it's
old, it's tired.

450
00:26:30,658 --> 00:26:32,024
It's been done a thousand times.

451
00:26:32,026 --> 00:26:35,194
So then who explains to the
audience what on Earth's going on?

452
00:26:35,196 --> 00:26:36,295
No one.

453
00:26:36,297 --> 00:26:38,263
I don't know. The killer.

454
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:39,932
Now you see what I
have to put up with?

455
00:26:39,934 --> 00:26:41,900
Will you please have a seat?

456
00:26:41,902 --> 00:26:44,670
So, a remote country house.

457
00:26:44,672 --> 00:26:48,040
We got all the, uh, suspects
gathered in the drawing room, right?

458
00:26:48,042 --> 00:26:50,409
So far, soporific.

459
00:26:50,411 --> 00:26:52,811
Suddenly, the lights go out.

460
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:57,952
Our hero grips his Colt
Special, edges into the hall.

461
00:26:59,687 --> 00:27:01,922
The killer's got a hostage,
can't get a clear shot.

462
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,289
Suddenly, kaboom!

463
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:06,024
The place goes up in flames.

464
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:08,193
Blam! Blam!

465
00:27:08,195 --> 00:27:09,962
Our hero plugs the killer.

466
00:27:09,964 --> 00:27:11,230
One in the gut!

467
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,031
One in the knee!

468
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:14,199
Then, all of a sudden...

469
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:18,137
His goddamned gun jams.

470
00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:19,306
He's a sittin' duck.

471
00:27:21,108 --> 00:27:22,174
Sorry, not that one.

472
00:27:23,244 --> 00:27:24,311
I'm sorry about this.

473
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:26,311
He's a sittin' duck.

474
00:27:27,715 --> 00:27:30,317
Our killer, dying but not dead,

475
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:32,419
takes aim.

476
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:35,087
Boom! He fires.

477
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:36,455
Out of nowhere,

478
00:27:36,457 --> 00:27:39,358
our hero cop's partner
dives in slow motion!

479
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,394
Takes a bullet!

480
00:27:42,396 --> 00:27:48,367
Our hero cradles his partner
like a father would his child.

481
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:51,172
His face a gumbo of emotions.

482
00:27:52,773 --> 00:27:55,242
We hold on the inferno,

483
00:27:56,877 --> 00:27:59,413
and we pan left,
to a dead butler.

484
00:28:01,815 --> 00:28:03,817
Hank Williams plays us out.

485
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:05,953
<i>I Saw The Light.</i>

486
00:28:13,994 --> 00:28:16,461
You hate it. No,
no, I don't hate it.

487
00:28:16,463 --> 00:28:18,864
But you don't love it.
Of course he doesn't!

488
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:19,932
It's preposterous

489
00:28:19,934 --> 00:28:22,401
and totally out of keeping
with the rest of the film.

490
00:28:22,403 --> 00:28:23,503
Oh, who cares?

491
00:28:23,505 --> 00:28:25,505
The audience only ever
remembers the last 20 minutes.

492
00:28:25,507 --> 00:28:27,072
Oh, poppycock.

493
00:28:27,074 --> 00:28:28,840
Uh, Hitchcock, actually.

494
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:30,244
How does he get the gun?

495
00:28:30,778 --> 00:28:31,644
He's a cop!

496
00:28:31,646 --> 00:28:34,146
Uh, police are not
armed in England.

497
00:28:34,148 --> 00:28:36,248
What? How do they
kill the bad guys?

498
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,282
They don't.

499
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:40,520
They ask them to stop
in the name of the law.

500
00:28:40,522 --> 00:28:42,120
Huh.

501
00:28:42,122 --> 00:28:43,455
Well, he fought in the war,

502
00:28:43,457 --> 00:28:45,991
so he kept his service revolver.

503
00:28:45,993 --> 00:28:48,896
God damn it, we're gonna have
to pick this up another time.

504
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:53,165
Say, uh, Merv.

505
00:28:53,167 --> 00:28:56,134
You wouldn't want to lend
me this pad, would you?

506
00:28:56,136 --> 00:28:57,903
Just for the night.

507
00:28:57,905 --> 00:29:01,039
Only I got this dame parked
outside I wanna impress.

508
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:03,110
As in, she actually is a dame.

509
00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:06,845
And, well, you know.

510
00:29:06,847 --> 00:29:09,414
My place ain't
exactly the Savoy.

511
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:12,050
I thought his place
exactly was the Savoy.

512
00:29:12,052 --> 00:29:15,053
No, he didn't take up residence
there till a month later.

513
00:29:15,055 --> 00:29:18,190
And the production company
footed the bill when he did.

514
00:29:18,192 --> 00:29:20,092
How he finagled that,
I'll never know.

515
00:29:21,195 --> 00:29:23,998
Either I need a new agent,
or he had dirt on Woolf.

516
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:25,399
Hmm.

517
00:29:29,504 --> 00:29:31,370
Did you ever meet these women?

518
00:29:31,372 --> 00:29:33,171
Who were they?

519
00:29:33,173 --> 00:29:35,274
Oh, girls he met during the war

520
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:37,376
who had low standards and
even lower self-esteem.

521
00:29:37,378 --> 00:29:38,946
I never had the pleasure.

522
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,283
Oh, wait.

523
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:44,517
Tell a lie.

524
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:48,521
Merv! Come on.

525
00:29:48,523 --> 00:29:50,355
When I said we should
tear up the script,

526
00:29:50,357 --> 00:29:51,559
I didn't mean literally!

527
00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:57,095
Hello, Leo.

528
00:29:57,097 --> 00:29:58,263
What is that doing here?

529
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:01,099
He was Kopernick's son!

530
00:30:01,101 --> 00:30:02,336
Peas in a pod.

531
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,136
And the mother?

532
00:30:04,138 --> 00:30:07,509
I didn't get a good look. A
plain girl, rather homely.

533
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:10,008
<i>Dark hair, glasses,</i>

534
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,078
thick lenses.

535
00:30:12,246 --> 00:30:13,945
So there we have it,
sir. <i>Cherchez la femme.</i>

536
00:30:13,947 --> 00:30:15,013
What?

537
00:30:15,015 --> 00:30:16,549
It's Belgian, sir. It
means, "Look for the woman."

538
00:30:16,551 --> 00:30:19,151
I know what it means,
Constable. What woman?

539
00:30:19,153 --> 00:30:21,521
The mother of Kopernick's
illegitimate son.

540
00:30:21,523 --> 00:30:23,422
Cocker-Norris couldn't
remember her name,

541
00:30:23,424 --> 00:30:25,123
but I bet it's in that
little black book.

542
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:27,292
You know, the one that you
found in the hotel room, sir.

543
00:30:27,294 --> 00:30:29,027
If we find her, we
have our answer.

544
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:30,962
We need to get a police sketch
artist down here at once

545
00:30:30,964 --> 00:30:32,299
before he forgets anything.

546
00:30:34,935 --> 00:30:37,637
Mmm. I'm doing it
again, aren't I, sir?

547
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:39,605
Jumping to conclusions.
Conclusions, yeah.

548
00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:40,872
Little bit.

549
00:30:40,874 --> 00:30:41,909
Sorry.

550
00:30:42,343 --> 00:30:43,377
Constable.

551
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,647
I have a very important
mission for you.

552
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:48,980
Mmm-hmm.

553
00:30:48,982 --> 00:30:51,316
I need you to find
a telephone box.

554
00:30:51,318 --> 00:30:52,618
Call the station.

555
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,487
Get an address for John
Woolf, the film producer.

556
00:30:55,489 --> 00:30:56,556
And I'll wait for you here.

557
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:59,360
Uh, "Romulus Films, Soho,"
sir. I wrote it down.

558
00:31:00,394 --> 00:31:01,962
You did? Mmm-hmm.

559
00:31:04,098 --> 00:31:05,466
Right.

560
00:31:06,266 --> 00:31:08,001
Well done. Thank you.

561
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:10,168
Shall we?

562
00:31:21,982 --> 00:31:23,350
Uh, telegram came for you.

563
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:27,520
Bad news?

564
00:31:27,522 --> 00:31:28,654
It's the studio.

565
00:31:28,656 --> 00:31:30,623
Grace Kelly's doing a
Hitchcock picture for Warner,

566
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:32,491
so it's Dial M for
Maybe Next Time.

567
00:31:32,493 --> 00:31:34,192
Grace Kelly? Yes.

568
00:31:34,194 --> 00:31:35,427
For the part you
promised Sheila?

569
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:37,597
Yes, that's right.

570
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:40,132
Which is why this
is such good news.

571
00:31:42,403 --> 00:31:43,969
Ann?

572
00:31:43,971 --> 00:31:45,203
Darling, what's the matter?

573
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:47,372
You do know a promise is only
a promise if you keep it.

574
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:48,407
What do you mean?

575
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:49,975
I mean you promised me
a night out months ago.

576
00:31:49,977 --> 00:31:51,176
I have been so busy lately.

577
00:31:51,178 --> 00:31:52,310
Yes, I know. I am
your assistant.

578
00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:54,212
I promise, as soon as I
have a moment to spare...

579
00:31:54,214 --> 00:31:55,648
Well, you're free on Wednesday.

580
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,382
Am I? Are you sure? Mmm. Yes.

581
00:31:57,384 --> 00:31:59,151
I thought I was... No.

582
00:31:59,153 --> 00:32:00,653
No, well, you should know.

583
00:32:00,655 --> 00:32:02,522
You are my assistant, after all.

584
00:32:02,524 --> 00:32:04,322
Well, that's settled,
then. It's a date.

585
00:32:04,324 --> 00:32:05,490
I promise I will take you out.

586
00:32:05,492 --> 00:32:07,325
I'm afraid, Mr. Woolf, you
really must be going now,

587
00:32:07,327 --> 00:32:08,460
otherwise you'll be late.

588
00:32:08,462 --> 00:32:10,230
Ah, right. Thank you. Mmm.

589
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:12,297
No, I'm serious.

590
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:13,566
You do actually need
to get back to Romulus.

591
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,002
Oh. Right. Okay. Yes. Yes.

592
00:32:24,077 --> 00:32:27,045
This is exciting, isn't it, sir?

593
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:28,180
I'd say this is
the type of thing

594
00:32:28,182 --> 00:32:30,350
that made you want to become
a police officer, was it?

595
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:37,324
Me? I just sort of
fell into it, really.

596
00:32:38,392 --> 00:32:40,025
They needed people
after the war,

597
00:32:40,027 --> 00:32:41,627
and I needed the money, so...

598
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,631
No, it's true. The
hours can be unsociable,

599
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:48,200
but I can't type or
stand the sight of blood,

600
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:50,703
so that ruled out
secretary for me.

601
00:32:50,705 --> 00:32:51,739
Mmm.

602
00:32:57,044 --> 00:32:58,644
You don't mind if I pick
your brains, do you, sir?

603
00:32:58,646 --> 00:33:00,646
Only I have sergeants'
exams in a month,

604
00:33:00,648 --> 00:33:03,281
and I just have one or two questions
that I'd love to run by you.

605
00:33:03,283 --> 00:33:04,216
Um... Actually, Constable,

606
00:33:04,218 --> 00:33:06,485
I've just remembered
that I have a, uh...

607
00:33:06,487 --> 00:33:08,621
dentist appointment.

608
00:33:08,623 --> 00:33:11,389
Oh. Sorry, sir. I didn't
know you were suffering.

609
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:12,592
Just a routine checkup.

610
00:33:12,594 --> 00:33:14,326
What shall I do,
sir? Wait here.

611
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:16,729
But what if Woolf turns up, sir?

612
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:19,364
Won't be long. And
you have your, uh,

613
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:20,400
notebook.

614
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,638
Keep your eyes
peeled. Yes, sir.

615
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:56,536
- Gin.
- Gin?

616
00:33:56,538 --> 00:33:58,105
Yeah, please.

617
00:34:08,783 --> 00:34:10,552
Oh, you're joking.

618
00:34:13,855 --> 00:34:15,188
Oh, no.

619
00:34:20,695 --> 00:34:22,296
Oh, God.

620
00:34:40,615 --> 00:34:42,550
Follow this up with
another, please.

621
00:35:25,727 --> 00:35:27,260
There you are, Constable.

622
00:35:28,696 --> 00:35:30,798
I've been looking
all over for you.

623
00:35:33,668 --> 00:35:36,201
So, I gather it was
you that, uh, paid

624
00:35:36,203 --> 00:35:39,739
for Mr. Kopernick's rather
extravagant hotel suite.

625
00:35:39,741 --> 00:35:42,440
Oh, nothing unusual
in that, Inspector.

626
00:35:42,442 --> 00:35:47,212
I'm afraid a producer is expected
to indulge the whims of the talent.

627
00:35:47,214 --> 00:35:50,215
Especially when
they're American.

628
00:35:50,217 --> 00:35:52,918
But still, a pretty penny,
a room at the Savoy.

629
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,020
Par for the course.

630
00:35:54,022 --> 00:35:57,523
When I was in the Congo
for <i>The African Queen,</i>

631
00:35:57,525 --> 00:36:01,627
Huston and Bogart refused
to drink the water.

632
00:36:01,629 --> 00:36:04,764
Insisted on bourbon, even
to brush their teeth.

633
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:08,266
Not so easy to get hold of in
the jungle, I can assure you.

634
00:36:08,268 --> 00:36:11,804
Huh. You know, Constable Stalker
here is a great admirer of that film.

635
00:36:11,806 --> 00:36:13,240
Aren't you, Constable?

636
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,242
It's a marvelous film, sir.

637
00:36:17,244 --> 00:36:19,244
Why, thank you, Constable.

638
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:20,880
Encyclopedia.

639
00:36:20,882 --> 00:36:22,782
Cinematic encyclopedia up there.

640
00:36:22,784 --> 00:36:24,550
I wouldn't say that. Yeah.

641
00:36:24,552 --> 00:36:25,785
Right.

642
00:36:25,787 --> 00:36:27,352
Being humble.

643
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:28,754
I'm not.

644
00:36:28,756 --> 00:36:31,258
So, it's not true that
Kopernick had dirt on you?

645
00:36:37,264 --> 00:36:38,798
Who told you that?

646
00:36:59,721 --> 00:37:02,454
Well, now, what do we have here?

647
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:06,458
Huh, Woolfie?

648
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,027
Sittin' in a quiet corner,

649
00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:09,931
all very nice and intimate.

650
00:37:10,565 --> 00:37:12,031
Hmm?

651
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:14,533
Say, you wouldn't mind if
I joined you, would you?

652
00:37:14,535 --> 00:37:16,401
Not at all, old boy.

653
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:17,870
Uh-huh.

654
00:37:17,872 --> 00:37:21,406
And you must be
Mrs. Woolf, huh?

655
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:23,475
Swell to make your acquaintance.

656
00:37:23,477 --> 00:37:26,411
No, no. Leo, this is Ann.

657
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:27,813
She's my assistant.

658
00:37:27,815 --> 00:37:28,850
Ah.

659
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:31,652
Workin' late, huh?

660
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:34,854
If you'll excuse me...

661
00:37:34,856 --> 00:37:36,591
Um, I'm sorry.

662
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:40,628
You have a nice night, now.

663
00:37:43,631 --> 00:37:45,332
Well, now.

664
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,502
This puts me in a tough spot.

665
00:37:51,672 --> 00:37:54,341
That I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to take advantage of.

666
00:37:56,744 --> 00:37:59,547
<i>He asked to be put up at
the Savoy, and I agreed.</i>

667
00:38:00,413 --> 00:38:02,782
I knew it wouldn't be for long.

668
00:38:02,784 --> 00:38:05,485
That is, just until I found
the right moment to...

669
00:38:07,054 --> 00:38:08,355
tell my wife.

670
00:38:10,357 --> 00:38:12,925
I see. Well,

671
00:38:12,927 --> 00:38:14,962
we'll be in touch if
there's anything else.

672
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:16,864
Uh...

673
00:38:17,698 --> 00:38:19,000
Constable.

674
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:20,568
Shall we?

675
00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:30,709
But, sir, Woolf killed
Kopernick to hush up the affair.

676
00:38:30,711 --> 00:38:31,844
Case closed.

677
00:38:31,846 --> 00:38:33,378
I think if that was the case,

678
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,100
he wouldn't have
volunteered the information.

679
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:38,383
So, then he's in the clear?

680
00:38:38,385 --> 00:38:39,552
No, not necessarily.

681
00:38:39,554 --> 00:38:41,835
He might have killed Kopernick
for another reason entirely.

682
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:44,890
I tell you,

683
00:38:44,892 --> 00:38:48,527
I'll never get the hang of this
in time for sergeants' exams.

684
00:38:53,768 --> 00:38:54,867
Constable, about earlier.

685
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:57,803
I know it looked like I'd
just come out of the pub.

686
00:38:57,805 --> 00:38:59,805
You had just come
out of the pub.

687
00:38:59,807 --> 00:39:01,507
That's right.

688
00:39:01,509 --> 00:39:02,908
But I'd only gone in there

689
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,710
to get rid of the
taste of the mouthwash.

690
00:39:04,712 --> 00:39:06,547
So you had a gin, sir.

691
00:39:07,815 --> 00:39:09,849
It's an antiseptic.
I had a filling.

692
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:11,853
I thought you said it
was a routine checkup.

693
00:39:13,654 --> 00:39:16,891
I see we've read the chapter
on interrogation techniques.

694
00:39:17,558 --> 00:39:19,558
Sir,

695
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,994
I know I haven't done
anything yet to impress you

696
00:39:21,996 --> 00:39:26,632
or to inspire any
confidence, and...

697
00:39:26,634 --> 00:39:28,834
I know you'd probably rather
that I wasn't on the case.

698
00:39:28,836 --> 00:39:32,137
But I didn't ask to be put
on this case either, sir.

699
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:34,874
I was nervous, and I still am,

700
00:39:34,876 --> 00:39:36,775
and I'm probably
trying a bit too hard.

701
00:39:36,777 --> 00:39:39,444
But, you know, even
if I do make mistakes

702
00:39:39,446 --> 00:39:40,779
or if I jump to conclusions

703
00:39:40,781 --> 00:39:43,749
or talk a little bit too
much, that has been said,

704
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:47,855
I just want you to know
that you can trust me.

705
00:39:48,823 --> 00:39:49,857
Sir.

706
00:39:53,828 --> 00:39:56,631
Okay. Good. Um...

707
00:41:17,011 --> 00:41:19,180
Oh, you're joking.

708
00:41:20,081 --> 00:41:22,181
Constable. Commissioner.

709
00:41:22,183 --> 00:41:23,349
Stoppard about?

710
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:25,684
Er, no, sir. He's not yet
made it in this morning.

711
00:41:25,686 --> 00:41:27,019
It's almost eleven o'clock.

712
00:41:27,021 --> 00:41:29,755
He, uh... He had a
dentist appointment, sir.

713
00:41:29,757 --> 00:41:31,590
A filling, I think
he said it was.

714
00:41:31,592 --> 00:41:32,558
A molar, it might have been?

715
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,561
I have been summoned
to the Home Secretary.

716
00:41:35,563 --> 00:41:36,929
He wants a debrief.

717
00:41:36,931 --> 00:41:38,566
I said I had good news.

718
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:48,209
Have you seen the
play, sir? Huh?

719
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,176
Oh. Yes.

720
00:41:51,178 --> 00:41:53,212
I'm afraid I took the
wife for her birthday.

721
00:41:53,214 --> 00:41:54,146
Oh.

722
00:41:54,148 --> 00:41:56,015
Of course, it didn't
fool me for a moment.

723
00:41:56,017 --> 00:41:57,218
I knew who did it right away.

724
00:41:58,252 --> 00:42:01,086
She was baffled, though.

725
00:42:01,088 --> 00:42:03,722
Even after the chap
explained everything.

726
00:42:03,724 --> 00:42:06,861
It was a trying night
for all concerned.

727
00:42:07,028 --> 00:42:08,227
Mmm.

728
00:42:08,229 --> 00:42:09,828
I'll stick to flowers in future.

729
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,730
Yes, always a safe bet, sir.

730
00:42:14,235 --> 00:42:15,601
Sorry.

731
00:42:15,603 --> 00:42:16,602
Police.

732
00:42:16,604 --> 00:42:18,672
Please try to be
more careful, sir.

733
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,280
Good morning.

734
00:42:28,282 --> 00:42:30,017
Commissioner. Inspector.

735
00:42:31,819 --> 00:42:33,185
Is it wise to eat so many mints?

736
00:42:33,187 --> 00:42:34,853
How do you mean, sir?

737
00:42:34,855 --> 00:42:37,958
Well, haven't you just
been to the dentist?

738
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,193
Yes, that's right, sir.

739
00:42:41,195 --> 00:42:42,830
Yeah. It was just a checkup.

740
00:42:44,965 --> 00:42:47,134
Although I did have
a filling as well.

741
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,868
Since I was there.

742
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,703
I've come down here for
an update, Inspector.

743
00:42:51,705 --> 00:42:53,105
We have good news, sir.

744
00:42:53,107 --> 00:42:54,673
We do?

745
00:42:54,675 --> 00:42:56,675
Yes, sir. Isn't that what
you told the Home Secretary?

746
00:42:56,677 --> 00:42:59,078
Yes, that's what I
told the Home Secretary

747
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,779
on the telephone.

748
00:43:00,781 --> 00:43:02,283
I came down here to get it.

749
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,117
So we don't have good news?

750
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,351
We do have a witness, sir.

751
00:43:06,353 --> 00:43:07,453
To the murder?

752
00:43:07,455 --> 00:43:09,922
Yeah, that would be
nice, wouldn't it?

753
00:43:09,924 --> 00:43:12,991
Um, no. One of the ushers
saw a suspicious character.

754
00:43:12,993 --> 00:43:14,695
He's waiting for us inside.

755
00:43:15,296 --> 00:43:16,929
Very well.

756
00:43:16,931 --> 00:43:20,232
I'll tell the Home Secretary
we have a promising lead.

757
00:43:20,234 --> 00:43:22,803
And I'll rely on you not
to make a liar out of me.

758
00:43:23,737 --> 00:43:25,237
Constable. Commissioner.

759
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:26,972
Inspector.

760
00:43:26,974 --> 00:43:28,008
Commissioner.

761
00:43:30,678 --> 00:43:31,810
Constable.

762
00:43:31,812 --> 00:43:32,847
Inspector.

763
00:43:36,117 --> 00:43:37,916
<i>So, Dennis, um,</i>

764
00:43:37,918 --> 00:43:40,152
I understand that you saw
something the other night.

765
00:43:40,154 --> 00:43:42,187
Yeah. What'd you see?

766
00:43:42,189 --> 00:43:45,090
Well, I'd gone to get a bottle
of Scotch for the dead man.

767
00:43:45,092 --> 00:43:49,161
Um... This was before,
you know, he died.

768
00:43:49,163 --> 00:43:50,863
Um... And then you came back,

769
00:43:50,865 --> 00:43:52,831
and that's when you saw
the suspicious character?

770
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:53,966
Exactly.

771
00:43:53,968 --> 00:43:56,068
Well, sort of.

772
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:58,937
I didn't get a very good
look, if I'm honest.

773
00:43:58,939 --> 00:44:02,374
He had on, like, a
darkish overcoat.

774
00:44:02,376 --> 00:44:05,010
I see. Anything else?

775
00:44:06,313 --> 00:44:08,780
A pair of trousers.

776
00:44:08,782 --> 00:44:10,449
And a hat.

777
00:44:10,451 --> 00:44:12,319
It was on his head.

778
00:44:13,087 --> 00:44:14,853
Right. Yeah.

779
00:44:14,855 --> 00:44:17,723
Yeah. A soft, felt hat.

780
00:44:17,725 --> 00:44:18,924
Mmm-hmm.

781
00:44:18,926 --> 00:44:20,225
What about a
physical description?

782
00:44:20,227 --> 00:44:23,195
Was he a tall man?
Short? Thick set?

783
00:44:23,197 --> 00:44:25,364
Oh... Just average, I'd say.

784
00:44:25,366 --> 00:44:27,799
Average height or average build?

785
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:29,036
Um...

786
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:30,871
Both?

787
00:44:31,739 --> 00:44:32,971
No, don't ask me.

788
00:44:32,973 --> 00:44:35,009
I don't know. I'm asking you.

789
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,045
Average height,

790
00:44:38,946 --> 00:44:40,212
medium build.

791
00:44:40,214 --> 00:44:42,314
Would you say like
the Inspector?

792
00:44:42,316 --> 00:44:43,448
Yeah.

793
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:44,950
Suppose so. Pretty much.

794
00:44:44,952 --> 00:44:48,253
So what did he do that
made you suspicious?

795
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,389
It wasn't so much what he did,

796
00:44:50,391 --> 00:44:53,394
it was more, you know,
the way he did it.

797
00:44:54,328 --> 00:44:56,395
Right. How'd he do it?

798
00:44:56,397 --> 00:44:58,832
Well, sort of...

799
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,302
suspiciously.

800
00:45:05,472 --> 00:45:07,107
This has been great.

801
00:45:07,775 --> 00:45:09,043
Off you go.

802
00:45:09,944 --> 00:45:11,210
Thank you. Thank you.

803
00:45:11,212 --> 00:45:12,246
Thank you.

804
00:45:14,081 --> 00:45:15,214
That was good.

805
00:45:15,216 --> 00:45:17,785
Do you think that went well?

806
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,520
I think it's time we
talk to that actor

807
00:45:20,522 --> 00:45:21,787
who had a fight with Kopernick.

808
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:23,155
Mr. Attenborough, sir?

809
00:45:23,157 --> 00:45:25,290
That's the one. Famous, is he?

810
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:28,360
You're pulling my leg, sir.
You've never heard of Dickie?

811
00:45:28,362 --> 00:45:29,461
Richard Attenborough?

812
00:45:29,463 --> 00:45:32,497
Pinkie Brown? <i>Brighton
Rock?</i> You must have.

813
00:45:32,499 --> 00:45:34,333
"You wanted a
recording of my voice.

814
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,367
"Well, here it is.

815
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:36,536
"What you want me to
say is 'I love you.'"

816
00:45:36,538 --> 00:45:40,405
Keep in mind that we're
here to conduct an interview

817
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:41,608
as part of a murder
investigation,

818
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:44,510
not an article for <i>Sight
& Sound</i> magazine, yes?

819
00:45:44,512 --> 00:45:45,813
Yes, sir.

820
00:45:47,047 --> 00:45:48,882
Come in, darling.

821
00:45:51,218 --> 00:45:52,884
Inspector Stoppard.

822
00:45:52,886 --> 00:45:55,921
I say, a real-life detective.

823
00:45:55,923 --> 00:45:58,023
Scotland Yard and everything.

824
00:45:58,025 --> 00:45:59,126
And you are?

825
00:46:03,197 --> 00:46:05,264
This is...

826
00:46:05,266 --> 00:46:07,199
Constable Stalker. Stalker.

827
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:11,103
Oh, I like the way you did that.

828
00:46:11,105 --> 00:46:12,838
Very natural.

829
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,141
I hope you don't mind, sir,
but I just want to say bravo.

830
00:46:16,143 --> 00:46:19,344
And, uh, encore. Oh.

831
00:46:19,346 --> 00:46:20,412
All right, thank you, Constable.

832
00:46:20,414 --> 00:46:21,880
Yes, thank you, Constable.

833
00:46:21,882 --> 00:46:23,315
Are you a lover of theater?

834
00:46:23,317 --> 00:46:24,852
I can get you
tickets if you like.

835
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:28,954
I would like, sir.
Yes. Very much.

836
00:46:28,956 --> 00:46:31,223
It would be good to get a
professional take on it.

837
00:46:31,225 --> 00:46:32,291
Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah.

838
00:46:32,293 --> 00:46:33,892
I have so many questions.

839
00:46:33,894 --> 00:46:35,460
I have one or two of my own.

840
00:46:35,462 --> 00:46:38,130
I dare say that you do.

841
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:40,999
I understand that you
and, uh, Kopernick

842
00:46:41,001 --> 00:46:43,035
came to blows the
night in question.

843
00:46:43,037 --> 00:46:45,904
Was there a particular
reason for the ill feeling?

844
00:46:45,906 --> 00:46:48,543
Tell me, Inspector, did you
get your limp during the war?

845
00:46:51,378 --> 00:46:52,444
It's very slight.

846
00:46:52,446 --> 00:46:54,046
I noticed it the other night

847
00:46:54,048 --> 00:46:56,248
- when you were on stage.
- I, um...

848
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:59,051
Well, I thought I might
borrow it, if you don't mind.

849
00:46:59,053 --> 00:47:02,354
It's always good for the lead
character to have a physical defect.

850
00:47:02,356 --> 00:47:05,424
Speaks to a troubled soul.

851
00:47:05,426 --> 00:47:08,628
It was me, Inspector.
You need look no further.

852
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:09,895
I arrest you

853
00:47:09,897 --> 00:47:11,129
for the murder of
Leo... No, no, no.

854
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:12,364
No. Not yet.

855
00:47:12,366 --> 00:47:13,498
Oh. Sorry, sir.

856
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,502
I was the particular
reason for the ill feeling.

857
00:47:16,504 --> 00:47:19,237
Yes, well, Leo had his
eye on Sheila, you see.

858
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:20,305
And I took exception.

859
00:47:20,307 --> 00:47:22,209
He was a real hound, Inspector.

860
00:47:26,046 --> 00:47:27,979
Come on, play nice.

861
00:47:27,981 --> 00:47:29,016
Maybe I can help you.

862
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:31,016
Help me?

863
00:47:31,018 --> 00:47:32,518
To do what?

864
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,022
Bag the lead role in the
film of <i>The Mousetrap.</i>

865
00:47:36,457 --> 00:47:37,923
Top billing.

866
00:47:37,925 --> 00:47:39,024
Make you a star.

867
00:47:39,026 --> 00:47:41,426
But I have bagged the lead role.

868
00:47:41,428 --> 00:47:43,128
Yeah, who told
you that, Woolfie?

869
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:44,996
He is the producer.

870
00:47:44,998 --> 00:47:46,932
Honey, he just cuts the checks.

871
00:47:46,934 --> 00:47:47,999
I'm the director.

872
00:47:48,001 --> 00:47:50,570
Without me, there is no
movie. You understand?

873
00:47:50,572 --> 00:47:52,439
You got a problem, buddy?

874
00:47:53,941 --> 00:47:56,108
Keep the change.
And the glass.

875
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:58,544
And the studio, don't
they have a say in it?

876
00:47:58,546 --> 00:48:01,980
Rumor is they want to
put a name in the picture

877
00:48:01,982 --> 00:48:04,349
that people have heard of.

878
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,952
Bona fide Hollywood star.

879
00:48:06,954 --> 00:48:09,423
They like Grace Kelly.
You ever heard of her?

880
00:48:13,093 --> 00:48:14,361
Don't worry.

881
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:16,997
They can be talked round.

882
00:48:18,098 --> 00:48:21,335
I've got a very,
uh, silver tongue.

883
00:48:26,473 --> 00:48:27,472
<i>I won't lie, Inspector.</i>

884
00:48:27,474 --> 00:48:29,642
I was not entirely sorry
to learn of his demise,

885
00:48:29,644 --> 00:48:31,677
but I had no part in it.

886
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:34,212
Much like the film adaptation
of <i>The Mousetrap,</i> it would seem.

887
00:48:34,214 --> 00:48:35,681
Oh, come now, darling,
you don't know that.

888
00:48:35,683 --> 00:48:37,717
Woolf promised you the role.

889
00:48:37,719 --> 00:48:40,051
He's a man of his
word. He went to Eton.

890
00:48:40,053 --> 00:48:41,587
Wake up, Dickie.

891
00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:43,589
He's a man of whatever word
will get his film made.

892
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:47,459
And that contract business with
Choo is coming apart at the seams.

893
00:48:47,461 --> 00:48:49,161
Choo? Bless you, sir.

894
00:48:49,163 --> 00:48:51,531
No, as in Petula Spencer.

895
00:48:51,533 --> 00:48:53,733
She sold Woolf the film rights.

896
00:48:53,735 --> 00:48:55,467
Well, about those tickets.

897
00:48:55,469 --> 00:48:56,636
Is there a day that
suits you better?

898
00:48:56,638 --> 00:49:00,005
Uh, I'm generally free on
Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

899
00:49:00,007 --> 00:49:00,840
And Thursdays.

900
00:49:00,842 --> 00:49:03,074
Well, thank you, sir.
Thank you, madam.

901
00:49:03,076 --> 00:49:04,710
No, no, not at all. We'll
be sure to let you know

902
00:49:04,712 --> 00:49:06,612
if anything else
springs to mind.

903
00:49:06,614 --> 00:49:09,481
I'm sure it's always
the insignificant detail

904
00:49:09,483 --> 00:49:11,584
that catches the
killer in the end.

905
00:49:11,586 --> 00:49:12,720
Isn't that so, Inspector?

906
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:20,258
I don't usually have a
lot on on weekends either.

907
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,728
Or Mondays. For the...
For the tickets.

908
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:24,029
Constable. Sir.

909
00:49:24,031 --> 00:49:25,096
Right.

910
00:49:59,266 --> 00:50:00,535
She'll see you now.

911
00:50:02,202 --> 00:50:04,336
So, you own this theater?

912
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:06,371
Yes. Humble beginnings.

913
00:50:07,642 --> 00:50:09,174
You'll have to excuse Mother.

914
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:11,644
She's not been herself
since Father died,

915
00:50:11,646 --> 00:50:13,779
in the first Great War.

916
00:50:13,781 --> 00:50:16,448
It's been a long 30 years.

917
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:18,383
It's nice that you
gave her a job.

918
00:50:18,385 --> 00:50:20,820
Well, how else is she
gonna pay the rent?

919
00:50:20,822 --> 00:50:23,656
I let her have the spare
room at a discount as it is.

920
00:50:23,658 --> 00:50:26,124
Yes, no. You can stop there.

921
00:50:26,126 --> 00:50:29,194
We get the idea. Bravo.

922
00:50:29,196 --> 00:50:30,830
I understand that
you handled the sale

923
00:50:30,832 --> 00:50:33,198
of <i>The Mousetrap</i> film
rights to John Woolf?

924
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,603
Yes, that's right.
I did. Wait... Why?

925
00:50:36,504 --> 00:50:37,672
What's he been saying?

926
00:50:38,506 --> 00:50:41,139
Oh, he's such a crybaby.

927
00:50:41,141 --> 00:50:44,175
Honestly, he acts as though
I put a gun to his head.

928
00:50:46,848 --> 00:50:48,280
Oh!

929
00:50:48,282 --> 00:50:50,248
Hang on a minute.
Is this important?

930
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:51,717
I doubt it. What does it say?

931
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:54,352
"No motion picture based on
the stage play <i>The Mousetrap</i>

932
00:50:54,354 --> 00:50:55,688
"is to enter into production

933
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:57,790
"until a minimum of
six months have elapsed

934
00:50:57,792 --> 00:50:59,825
"since the end of its
first theatrical run."

935
00:50:59,827 --> 00:51:01,727
Oh, you don't need
to worry about that.

936
00:51:01,729 --> 00:51:02,695
It's a whodunit.

937
00:51:02,697 --> 00:51:04,296
As soon as word gets
out who did do it,

938
00:51:04,298 --> 00:51:05,865
audiences are bound to drop off.

939
00:51:05,867 --> 00:51:09,769
Come on, sign on the dotted
line, and I'll make a toast.

940
00:51:14,174 --> 00:51:16,542
Ann, darling, the
next contract I sign

941
00:51:16,544 --> 00:51:18,476
will be our marriage
certificate.

942
00:51:18,478 --> 00:51:21,212
Well, first it'll be
the divorce papers.

943
00:51:21,214 --> 00:51:23,383
But then our
marriage certificate.

944
00:51:25,352 --> 00:51:27,287
Edana, darling.

945
00:51:28,288 --> 00:51:29,154
What a pleasant surprise.

946
00:51:29,156 --> 00:51:31,791
You know Choo and,
uh... Mmm-hmm.

947
00:51:31,793 --> 00:51:32,892
Ann. I do.

948
00:51:32,894 --> 00:51:34,860
Dear girl, what on Earth
are you doing down there?

949
00:51:34,862 --> 00:51:38,263
I just fell over. Excuse me.

950
00:51:38,265 --> 00:51:41,199
Honestly, it's like having
Buster Keaton for an assistant.

951
00:51:41,201 --> 00:51:42,802
Now, I've just come
from Madame Zena...

952
00:51:42,804 --> 00:51:44,804
Oh, darling, I really wish
you wouldn't see that...

953
00:51:44,806 --> 00:51:46,171
Please don't call
her a charlatan.

954
00:51:46,173 --> 00:51:47,333
I was going to say "crackpot."

955
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:53,278
- What's this?
- It's a Tarot card.

956
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,849
I can see that.
What does it mean?

957
00:51:55,617 --> 00:51:56,682
Betrayal.

958
00:52:02,557 --> 00:52:03,623
Ooh.

959
00:52:03,625 --> 00:52:06,358
Betrayal as in his
affair, not the contract.

960
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,661
That was above board.
Is above board.

961
00:52:08,663 --> 00:52:11,296
Agatha insisted on
that clause, not me.

962
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:14,700
No, she's fiercely protective of
her own work, you see, because...

963
00:52:14,702 --> 00:52:16,636
Well, she has to be.

964
00:52:16,638 --> 00:52:18,571
People get so riled up.

965
00:52:18,573 --> 00:52:20,438
She's had death
threats, you know.

966
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,475
Poor girl can't write so
much as a letter to <i>The Times</i>

967
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:25,276
without a deluge of legal action

968
00:52:25,278 --> 00:52:28,714
and spurious claims she stole
this plot or that character.

969
00:52:28,716 --> 00:52:30,650
Isn't that what
happened here, though?

970
00:52:30,652 --> 00:52:34,285
Isn't <i>The Mousetrap</i>
based on a true story?

971
00:52:34,287 --> 00:52:38,223
Yes. Well, originally.
I mean, tangentially.

972
00:52:38,225 --> 00:52:39,424
In any case, that's the reason

973
00:52:39,426 --> 00:52:42,795
Woolf was so keen to shut
the theater the other night.

974
00:52:42,797 --> 00:52:44,329
He can't make his film

975
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:46,932
until the play ends its
run in the West End.

976
00:52:46,934 --> 00:52:50,368
As it is, what with the play
being such a phenomenal success,

977
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:53,405
he's stuck in
theatrical purgatory.

978
00:52:53,407 --> 00:52:54,272
Mmm-hmm.

979
00:52:54,274 --> 00:52:56,909
He's a ruthless
customer, is Woolf.

980
00:52:56,911 --> 00:52:59,614
He'll stop at nothing
to get his film made.

981
00:53:05,753 --> 00:53:07,387
<i>It's definitely Woolf, sir.</i>

982
00:53:08,255 --> 00:53:10,388
Well, not 100%.

983
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:14,694
More like 73-74%, I'd say.

984
00:53:14,696 --> 00:53:18,531
He killed Kopernick in the
theater to force it to close down

985
00:53:18,533 --> 00:53:20,432
so that he could make his film.

986
00:53:20,434 --> 00:53:22,500
He could marry his mistress.

987
00:53:22,502 --> 00:53:24,402
And then he could get
shot of a blackmailer.

988
00:53:24,404 --> 00:53:26,271
It's not Woolf.
It's too elaborate.

989
00:53:26,273 --> 00:53:28,306
Burn the place down, if
that's what you want.

990
00:53:28,308 --> 00:53:31,610
Besides, doesn't he need
a director to make a film?

991
00:53:31,612 --> 00:53:33,278
Well, then it's back
to Cocker-Norris.

992
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,582
Process of elimination.

993
00:53:35,382 --> 00:53:36,749
No, it's not Mervyn.

994
00:53:36,751 --> 00:53:39,451
Yeah, but the tongue business.

995
00:53:39,453 --> 00:53:41,421
And he clearly didn't
like Leo, did he?

996
00:53:44,291 --> 00:53:45,891
People don't rip out
other people's tongues

997
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:47,325
because of creative differences.

998
00:53:47,327 --> 00:53:49,729
They do it out of revenge

999
00:53:49,731 --> 00:53:51,530
or rage because they've
lost a loved one.

1000
00:53:51,532 --> 00:53:52,631
They can't forgive or forget,

1001
00:53:52,633 --> 00:53:55,300
so they just stew and
fester alone in the dark

1002
00:53:55,302 --> 00:53:56,502
until finally it all comes out

1003
00:53:56,504 --> 00:53:58,906
in a sudden, frenzied
act of violence.

1004
00:54:04,579 --> 00:54:06,377
How did you get the limp, sir?

1005
00:54:06,379 --> 00:54:07,847
If you don't mind me asking.

1006
00:54:07,849 --> 00:54:10,916
Uh, in the war. Got shot
in the Italian Alps.

1007
00:54:10,918 --> 00:54:11,953
Hmm.

1008
00:54:13,554 --> 00:54:14,756
Sounds painful.

1009
00:54:16,323 --> 00:54:18,356
What do you...

1010
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:20,659
Sorry, sir.

1011
00:54:20,661 --> 00:54:22,830
No, that's very funny.

1012
00:54:24,565 --> 00:54:27,432
Is there a
Mr. Stalker, Stalker?

1013
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:29,704
Uh, I'm afraid he
died in the war, sir.

1014
00:54:31,606 --> 00:54:32,738
Children?

1015
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,339
A boy and a girl.

1016
00:54:34,341 --> 00:54:36,441
Can't be easy.

1017
00:54:36,443 --> 00:54:39,044
What about you? Do you
have any family, sir?

1018
00:54:39,046 --> 00:54:41,847
Uh, I came close, once.

1019
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:43,749
Yeah, I had an unfaithful wife.

1020
00:54:43,751 --> 00:54:45,584
Oh.

1021
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:46,819
She was eight months pregnant

1022
00:54:46,821 --> 00:54:48,421
when she told me I
wasn't the father.

1023
00:54:50,558 --> 00:54:52,660
I'd made a cot and everything.

1024
00:54:53,728 --> 00:54:55,930
That's awful, sir. I'm sorry.

1025
00:54:59,366 --> 00:55:01,000
- Landlord.
- Yes, sir?

1026
00:55:01,002 --> 00:55:02,500
Another round.

1027
00:55:02,502 --> 00:55:03,569
Oh, I don't know.

1028
00:55:03,571 --> 00:55:05,805
Should we maybe get going, sir?

1029
00:55:05,807 --> 00:55:07,438
Got work tomorrow.

1030
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:12,745
Go on, steer off before
I call the police!

1031
00:55:14,649 --> 00:55:17,082
Sorry again. Thank you.

1032
00:55:17,084 --> 00:55:19,084
Are you sure you're all
right to drive, sir?

1033
00:55:19,086 --> 00:55:20,451
Absolutely.

1034
00:55:20,453 --> 00:55:21,452
Oh!

1035
00:55:21,454 --> 00:55:23,624
I could run you
home if you like.

1036
00:55:37,605 --> 00:55:41,574
Now. Just gonna pop you there.

1037
00:55:41,576 --> 00:55:43,511
I can take it from
here, Constable.

1038
00:55:47,014 --> 00:55:48,514
Oh.

1039
00:55:48,516 --> 00:55:49,550
Sir.

1040
00:55:56,023 --> 00:55:57,058
There we go.

1041
00:57:13,134 --> 00:57:14,501
Morning, sir.

1042
00:57:15,569 --> 00:57:17,202
What do you want?

1043
00:57:17,204 --> 00:57:20,806
Uh, the other night,
sir. The dead Yank.

1044
00:57:20,808 --> 00:57:23,878
Inspector Stoppard got the call
and not Leeke or Priestley.

1045
00:57:24,779 --> 00:57:25,813
So?

1046
00:57:35,589 --> 00:57:37,856
Leeke was in Skegness
on his honeymoon,

1047
00:57:37,858 --> 00:57:39,927
and Priestley took the
Rillington Place call.

1048
00:57:42,096 --> 00:57:43,130
What time?

1049
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:47,935
Half-past 11:00. <i>Book
at Bedtime</i> was on.

1050
00:57:53,774 --> 00:57:56,110
Did you ever meet
Stoppard's wife, sir?

1051
00:57:56,911 --> 00:57:57,910
I did.

1052
00:57:57,912 --> 00:57:59,981
You don't happen to
remember her name, do you?

1053
00:58:07,088 --> 00:58:08,222
It was...

1054
00:58:10,257 --> 00:58:12,026
Mrs. Stoppard.

1055
00:58:14,762 --> 00:58:15,796
Brilliant.

1056
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,849
Hello, is this Abigale?

1057
00:58:36,917 --> 00:58:38,150
Hello, is this Beryl?

1058
00:58:38,152 --> 00:58:40,319
I am a friend of
Leo Kopernick's.

1059
00:58:41,856 --> 00:58:42,890
Beryl?

1060
00:58:44,592 --> 00:58:46,293
Is Geraldine there
by any chance?

1061
00:59:13,754 --> 00:59:15,754
- Oh, Constable.
- Sir.

1062
00:59:15,756 --> 00:59:18,090
Did Dickie ever come through
on those theater tickets?

1063
00:59:18,092 --> 00:59:21,660
I thought of going, and, uh...
Maybe the play's the thing

1064
00:59:21,662 --> 00:59:25,097
Ties this all together.
Would you like to tag along?

1065
00:59:25,099 --> 00:59:26,667
Yes, sir. Um...

1066
00:59:28,702 --> 00:59:30,135
What is it, Constable?

1067
00:59:30,137 --> 00:59:31,906
Uh, nothing, sir. Oh.

1068
00:59:32,807 --> 00:59:35,741
Do you, um, want a cup of tea?

1069
00:59:35,743 --> 00:59:38,310
Listen to me, Stalker.

1070
00:59:38,312 --> 00:59:42,314
No one is ever going to take you
seriously as a police officer

1071
00:59:42,316 --> 00:59:44,083
if you act like a
tea-lady, do you hear me?

1072
00:59:44,085 --> 00:59:45,717
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

1073
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:47,154
Milk and two sugars.

1074
00:59:51,725 --> 00:59:52,791
Commissioner.

1075
01:00:00,201 --> 01:00:01,733
I said, "Who do you want?

1076
01:00:01,735 --> 01:00:04,403
"Agatha Christie or
Mervyn Cocker-Norris?

1077
01:00:04,405 --> 01:00:07,306
"Anyone can do her,
but only I can do me."

1078
01:00:07,308 --> 01:00:09,741
<i>Stronzo.</i>

1079
01:00:09,743 --> 01:00:13,345
<i>The Mousetrap</i> in the
house style, as it were.

1080
01:00:13,347 --> 01:00:15,180
I'll take the bare
bones of the story,

1081
01:00:15,182 --> 01:00:19,086
a rather mundane tale of child
abuse, and make it my own.

1082
01:00:22,957 --> 01:00:24,656
Here we are.

1083
01:00:24,658 --> 01:00:27,126
Oh. These aren't
together, sir.

1084
01:00:27,128 --> 01:00:28,327
Oh.

1085
01:00:28,329 --> 01:00:30,395
Well, we can cover
more ground that way.

1086
01:00:30,397 --> 01:00:31,730
Keep your eyes peeled.

1087
01:00:31,732 --> 01:00:33,298
Yes, sir.

1088
01:00:43,144 --> 01:00:44,278
Cheers.

1089
01:00:57,091 --> 01:00:58,125
Hello?

1090
01:01:01,395 --> 01:01:03,195
Hello?

1091
01:01:03,197 --> 01:01:05,464
Is anyone there?

1092
01:01:05,466 --> 01:01:07,968
Who's calling at this late hour?

1093
01:01:09,103 --> 01:01:10,137
Yes?

1094
01:01:10,771 --> 01:01:11,805
All right then.

1095
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,740
That was Scotland Yard.

1096
01:01:14,742 --> 01:01:16,808
They're sending
out an inspector.

1097
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:19,845
In this unseasonable blizzard?

1098
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:22,080
What on Earth for?

1099
01:01:22,082 --> 01:01:23,784
Good Lord.

1100
01:01:25,452 --> 01:01:26,752
Inspector.

1101
01:01:26,754 --> 01:01:27,821
Thank you.

1102
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:30,224
Good evening.

1103
01:01:32,359 --> 01:01:34,862
I am Detective Sergeant Trotter.

1104
01:01:35,496 --> 01:01:37,129
Please excuse the limp.

1105
01:01:37,131 --> 01:01:40,098
An old war wound
playing up in the cold.

1106
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,770
I'm assuming you were
warned of my arrival?

1107
01:01:44,104 --> 01:01:47,406
Apropos of nothing,
I'm a magistrate.

1108
01:01:47,408 --> 01:01:50,342
Also, he looks too young
to be an inspector.

1109
01:01:50,344 --> 01:01:53,513
Well, I'm old enough to
remember the Corrigan Case.

1110
01:01:53,515 --> 01:01:57,115
Yes, a dreadful business.

1111
01:01:57,117 --> 01:02:01,820
Two brothers who put their faith
in the British social services.

1112
01:02:01,822 --> 01:02:04,925
A sorry tale of abuse
that ended in tragedy.

1113
01:02:06,327 --> 01:02:08,060
Yes, it was in
all of the papers.

1114
01:02:08,062 --> 01:02:09,861
Gio, I can't sit
through this again.

1115
01:02:09,863 --> 01:02:11,863
I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?

1116
01:02:11,865 --> 01:02:16,802
One died, the other
left traumatized.

1117
01:02:16,804 --> 01:02:19,204
I shudder to think what
an ordeal like that

1118
01:02:19,206 --> 01:02:21,073
might do to a vulnerable mind.

1119
01:02:21,075 --> 01:02:21,940
Won't be a moment.

1120
01:02:21,942 --> 01:02:23,842
I'm just going to
try and catch Mervyn.

1121
01:02:23,844 --> 01:02:25,545
Oh, bother. I forgot the tea.

1122
01:02:25,547 --> 01:02:27,846
By God, that has to be

1123
01:02:27,848 --> 01:02:30,349
the worst cup of
tea I've ever had.

1124
01:02:31,952 --> 01:02:34,186
I agree.

1125
01:02:34,188 --> 01:02:37,823
Did you make it in a
teapot or a plant pot?

1126
01:02:37,825 --> 01:02:38,824
Pardon me.

1127
01:02:38,826 --> 01:02:40,158
- Excuse me. Thank you. Sorry.
- Oh, dear.

1128
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,326
Pardon me. Excuse me. Sorry.

1129
01:02:41,328 --> 01:02:44,496
I've already had another
disaster in the kitchen.

1130
01:02:44,498 --> 01:02:48,002
I left out the steak pieces
in my steak and kidney pie.

1131
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:50,536
Gloves.

1132
01:02:50,538 --> 01:02:52,572
Kidney pie just doesn't
have the same ring to it.

1133
01:02:52,574 --> 01:02:54,273
Sorry. Excuse me. Pardon me.

1134
01:02:54,275 --> 01:02:55,476
Excuse me. Terribly sorry.

1135
01:02:56,544 --> 01:02:58,410
Bleeding gloves. I'm so sorry.

1136
01:02:58,412 --> 01:03:00,112
There they are. Thank you.

1137
01:03:00,114 --> 01:03:01,947
Sorry. Sorry. Terribly sorry.

1138
01:03:01,949 --> 01:03:02,914
I'm beginning to think

1139
01:03:02,916 --> 01:03:04,082
it was a dreadful
mistake to skip lunch.

1140
01:03:04,084 --> 01:03:05,286
Excuse me.

1141
01:03:06,521 --> 01:03:08,422
I'll open a tin of peas.

1142
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:47,593
<i>We interrupt</i> Book at Bedtime

1143
01:03:47,595 --> 01:03:51,363
<i>to warn residents in the
Colney Hatch area of London</i>

1144
01:03:51,365 --> 01:03:54,900
<i>to be on the lookout
for an escaped lunatic.</i>

1145
01:04:00,207 --> 01:04:01,543
Hmm.

1146
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:14,386
You startled me.

1147
01:04:14,388 --> 01:04:16,556
You startled me.

1148
01:04:52,426 --> 01:04:53,959
Turn the lights on.

1149
01:05:19,186 --> 01:05:21,321
Stop in the name of the law!

1150
01:05:31,331 --> 01:05:33,167
Bollocks!

1151
01:05:37,171 --> 01:05:39,004
Well, that's a good thing.

1152
01:05:39,006 --> 01:05:40,307
The limp, was it too much?

1153
01:05:41,676 --> 01:05:43,475
Oh. Oh, God.

1154
01:05:43,477 --> 01:05:45,645
Oh, sorry, sir. I thought
you were somebody else.

1155
01:05:45,647 --> 01:05:47,212
No, no, it's all right.

1156
01:05:47,214 --> 01:05:48,614
And thank you for the tickets.

1157
01:05:48,616 --> 01:05:49,684
Very welcome.

1158
01:06:39,701 --> 01:06:41,233
There ya go.

1159
01:06:41,235 --> 01:06:42,467
Bottoms up.

1160
01:06:42,469 --> 01:06:43,505
Cheers.

1161
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:50,408
What brings you to
this neck of the woods?

1162
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:52,477
Oh, a murder investigation.

1163
01:06:52,479 --> 01:06:54,682
Yeah? Anyone I know?

1164
01:06:56,083 --> 01:06:57,182
You.

1165
01:07:00,655 --> 01:07:01,821
I'm sorry, I thought...

1166
01:07:01,823 --> 01:07:04,291
No, no, no. It's all right.
It's all right. Uh...

1167
01:07:05,727 --> 01:07:07,562
Say, uh, Inspector.

1168
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:11,498
Tell me, was anyone, uh...

1169
01:07:13,267 --> 01:07:15,637
you know, sad to see me go?

1170
01:07:19,741 --> 01:07:20,775
Ah.

1171
01:07:22,209 --> 01:07:23,243
Figures.

1172
01:07:31,418 --> 01:07:33,285
I'm sorry, sir, you
can't go in there.

1173
01:07:33,287 --> 01:07:34,219
Ah...

1174
01:07:34,221 --> 01:07:35,821
You can only go in
if you have a ticket.

1175
01:07:35,823 --> 01:07:38,423
I had a ticket. It
was in my pocket.

1176
01:07:38,425 --> 01:07:42,193
That's... I could have sworn
I had on a pair of trousers.

1177
01:07:42,195 --> 01:07:43,430
I had trousers on.

1178
01:07:45,232 --> 01:07:46,331
Where's my ticket?

1179
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:47,733
I'm sorry, sir.

1180
01:07:47,735 --> 01:07:49,434
I can't let you in
unless you have a ticket.

1181
01:07:49,436 --> 01:07:51,804
I had a ticket. I just
don't have it on me.

1182
01:07:51,806 --> 01:07:54,139
Let me in! Stop mucking about.

1183
01:07:54,141 --> 01:07:55,508
I've gotta go in.
No, please, sir.

1184
01:07:58,478 --> 01:07:59,747
You. I know you.

1185
01:08:01,415 --> 01:08:02,548
What are you doing?

1186
01:08:04,251 --> 01:08:06,184
<i>Sir. Sir.</i>

1187
01:08:06,186 --> 01:08:07,421
I've got a ticket!

1188
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:14,161
The hell is going on?

1189
01:08:17,599 --> 01:08:18,800
What am I doing here?

1190
01:08:19,734 --> 01:08:21,466
What happened to my trousers?

1191
01:08:21,468 --> 01:08:22,902
You asked me to press them, sir.

1192
01:08:22,904 --> 01:08:24,169
I did?

1193
01:08:24,171 --> 01:08:25,439
Yes, sir. You were adamant.

1194
01:08:28,342 --> 01:08:29,711
How long have I been here?

1195
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:31,411
Eighteen hours.

1196
01:08:35,248 --> 01:08:37,516
My head is killing me.

1197
01:08:37,518 --> 01:08:39,286
It's bloody freezing in here.

1198
01:08:41,321 --> 01:08:42,489
Did you make an arrest?

1199
01:08:43,891 --> 01:08:45,658
We did.

1200
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:47,560
Who was it? Was it Gio?

1201
01:08:47,562 --> 01:08:49,294
Gio?

1202
01:08:49,296 --> 01:08:52,665
Yeah, Gio. The... The
Italian chap, the killer.

1203
01:08:52,667 --> 01:08:55,601
The man in a darkish
overcoat, soft felt hat...

1204
01:08:55,603 --> 01:08:57,335
I chased out the theater.

1205
01:08:57,337 --> 01:08:59,239
Inspector, that man was you.

1206
01:08:59,507 --> 01:09:00,840
What?

1207
01:09:00,842 --> 01:09:03,943
You are the man in
the darkish overcoat

1208
01:09:03,945 --> 01:09:07,780
and the soft felt hat that
Constable Stalker here

1209
01:09:07,782 --> 01:09:09,449
chased from the theater.

1210
01:09:10,618 --> 01:09:13,552
I'm sorry, I'm not following.

1211
01:09:13,554 --> 01:09:15,521
I think I might
have a concussion.

1212
01:09:15,523 --> 01:09:16,658
Or the shakes?

1213
01:09:21,763 --> 01:09:23,529
No, this is ridiculous.

1214
01:09:23,531 --> 01:09:25,731
What possible reason

1215
01:09:25,733 --> 01:09:27,667
could I have for
strangling a playwright?

1216
01:09:27,669 --> 01:09:30,235
I haven't seen
anything he's done.

1217
01:09:30,237 --> 01:09:33,841
No, but Mervyn saw the woman who
visited Kopernick at the Savoy.

1218
01:09:34,776 --> 01:09:36,542
So?

1219
01:09:36,544 --> 01:09:40,515
Inspector, have you
spoken to Joyce lately?

1220
01:09:40,982 --> 01:09:42,414
Joyce?

1221
01:09:42,416 --> 01:09:43,549
Your wife.

1222
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,482
Ex-wife.

1223
01:09:44,484 --> 01:09:46,952
Yes. I met her once
at a police social.

1224
01:09:46,954 --> 01:09:49,822
A plain girl.

1225
01:09:49,824 --> 01:09:50,823
Very homely.

1226
01:09:50,825 --> 01:09:53,526
What does Joyce have
to do with anything?

1227
01:09:53,528 --> 01:09:56,762
Uh, her name was in Leo's
little black book, sir.

1228
01:09:56,764 --> 01:09:57,930
Oh, come on. You don't...

1229
01:09:57,932 --> 01:09:59,999
You don't seriously
think that Leo and...

1230
01:10:00,001 --> 01:10:02,735
Didn't your wife
leave you for a Yank?

1231
01:10:02,737 --> 01:10:05,604
Leo was an American G.I.

1232
01:10:05,606 --> 01:10:08,408
Will you listen to yourselves?
You hear what you're sayin'?

1233
01:10:09,644 --> 01:10:10,678
Constable.

1234
01:10:16,383 --> 01:10:18,751
"They do it out
of revenge or rage

1235
01:10:18,753 --> 01:10:23,354
"because they have lost a loved
one and can't forgive or forget.

1236
01:10:23,356 --> 01:10:25,725
"So they just stew and fester

1237
01:10:25,727 --> 01:10:29,496
"until it all comes out in a
sudden, frenzied act of violence."

1238
01:10:32,265 --> 01:10:33,835
You wrote that down.

1239
01:10:36,971 --> 01:10:40,506
That was a private conversation.

1240
01:10:40,508 --> 01:10:42,610
Well, I thought it
could be important, sir.

1241
01:10:43,911 --> 01:10:45,445
Unbelievable.

1242
01:10:47,949 --> 01:10:49,414
We found her.

1243
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:50,816
Who? Joyce.

1244
01:10:50,818 --> 01:10:52,618
Joyce. Joyce is here?

1245
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:53,654
Constable.

1246
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:13,708
That's not my wife.

1247
01:11:15,342 --> 01:11:17,743
I'm sorry? I said
that's not my wife.

1248
01:11:17,745 --> 01:11:20,345
But it is your ex-wife.

1249
01:11:20,347 --> 01:11:22,784
Never seen that woman
before in my life.

1250
01:11:24,852 --> 01:11:26,353
But your name is Joyce?

1251
01:11:26,521 --> 01:11:27,853
Uh...

1252
01:11:27,855 --> 01:11:29,891
Well, it's a common name.

1253
01:11:31,391 --> 01:11:32,660
'Course it is. Yeah.

1254
01:11:34,427 --> 01:11:35,663
'Course it is.

1255
01:11:37,832 --> 01:11:40,733
Well, Inspector, in
that case, I believe

1256
01:11:40,735 --> 01:11:42,435
you are owed an apology.

1257
01:11:44,605 --> 01:11:46,674
Constable.

1258
01:11:48,408 --> 01:11:50,876
Uh... Yes, sir. O' course.

1259
01:11:50,878 --> 01:11:52,978
I'm... I'm so sorry,
sir. I just...

1260
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:57,049
I just got the wrong end of the
stick, and I have no excuse. I just...

1261
01:11:57,051 --> 01:11:59,854
I jumped to conclusions
again. I'm so sorry.

1262
01:12:05,059 --> 01:12:08,127
Commissioner, why don't you
run along back to the office,

1263
01:12:08,129 --> 01:12:09,829
look over the
quarterly accounts.

1264
01:12:09,831 --> 01:12:11,997
Let me handle the
murder investigation.

1265
01:12:11,999 --> 01:12:13,400
Inspector.

1266
01:12:16,537 --> 01:12:17,638
Sorry.

1267
01:12:52,139 --> 01:12:53,973
It's Dickie and Sheila.

1268
01:12:53,975 --> 01:12:57,011
Hello, Woolf. Didn't
expect to see you here.

1269
01:13:00,915 --> 01:13:03,115
Perhaps, it is

1270
01:13:03,117 --> 01:13:05,851
Miss Rams... bottom.

1271
01:13:05,853 --> 01:13:08,122
Get that...

1272
01:13:14,962 --> 01:13:16,494
If you have broken down,

1273
01:13:16,496 --> 01:13:19,531
there is a garage not
15 miles from here.

1274
01:13:19,533 --> 01:13:21,499
No, we're here for dinner.

1275
01:13:21,501 --> 01:13:23,068
I don't think so, sir.

1276
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:26,471
This is Winterbrook House?

1277
01:13:26,473 --> 01:13:27,742
The Christie residence?

1278
01:13:28,643 --> 01:13:29,742
It is.

1279
01:13:29,744 --> 01:13:30,809
Uh, we have an invitation.

1280
01:13:30,811 --> 01:13:31,846
We do, yes.

1281
01:13:33,781 --> 01:13:35,983
Richard Attenborough.
Friends call me "Dickie."

1282
01:13:43,824 --> 01:13:46,027
I do hope you
haven't traveled far.

1283
01:13:49,997 --> 01:13:52,064
Fellowes! Who is it?

1284
01:13:52,066 --> 01:13:54,900
No one, sir. Tinkers.

1285
01:13:54,902 --> 01:13:57,169
What, in this
unseasonable blizzard?

1286
01:13:57,171 --> 01:13:59,738
Come on, man. Open sesame.

1287
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:01,640
Richard Attenborough.
Friends call me "Dickie."

1288
01:14:01,642 --> 01:14:03,842
Max Mallowan, eminent
archaeologist.

1289
01:14:03,844 --> 01:14:05,110
Good God, man,
you're frozen solid.

1290
01:14:05,112 --> 01:14:06,745
It's cold. It's
cold, yes. Come in.

1291
01:14:06,747 --> 01:14:08,747
Hello, Sheila Sim. Hello.

1292
01:14:08,749 --> 01:14:10,516
John Woolf. How do you do?

1293
01:14:10,518 --> 01:14:11,550
Ann Saville.

1294
01:14:11,552 --> 01:14:13,519
We're friends of
Petula. Spencer.

1295
01:14:13,521 --> 01:14:15,854
Oh, yes. I know Choo.

1296
01:14:15,856 --> 01:14:18,590
We thought we'd been
invited for dinner.

1297
01:14:18,592 --> 01:14:21,026
Yes, we received this,

1298
01:14:21,028 --> 01:14:23,262
but apparently, not from you.

1299
01:14:23,264 --> 01:14:25,230
Extraordinary.

1300
01:14:25,232 --> 01:14:28,067
You know who's going
to love this? Agatha.

1301
01:14:28,069 --> 01:14:30,035
It's just like one
of her confections.

1302
01:14:30,037 --> 01:14:31,170
She's in the kitchen now

1303
01:14:31,172 --> 01:14:33,005
trying to figure
out some new ending.

1304
01:14:33,007 --> 01:14:35,941
It helps to do the
dishes, apparently.

1305
01:14:39,613 --> 01:14:42,948
Ooh, hello. Who else
didn't we invite to dinner?

1306
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:44,283
Ah, it's Petula.

1307
01:14:44,285 --> 01:14:45,720
Why, so it is.

1308
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:48,020
Come in out of the cold, Choo!

1309
01:14:48,022 --> 01:14:49,824
What on Earth have
you got there?

1310
01:14:50,891 --> 01:14:52,024
It's not Mother, is it?

1311
01:14:52,026 --> 01:14:53,594
'Fraid so.

1312
01:14:53,861 --> 01:14:55,728
Oh, God.

1313
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:56,929
Better make that eight
for dinner, Fellowes,

1314
01:14:56,931 --> 01:14:58,697
and let Agatha know. Yes, sir.

1315
01:14:58,699 --> 01:14:59,932
And get a shovel
to clear the path.

1316
01:14:59,934 --> 01:15:01,000
Yes, sir.

1317
01:15:01,002 --> 01:15:02,134
And do we have enough coal?

1318
01:15:02,136 --> 01:15:03,869
Yes, sir. Three
bags full, sir.

1319
01:15:03,871 --> 01:15:05,806
Hello, Maxie. Hello, darling.

1320
01:15:06,307 --> 01:15:08,640
Oh, it's a full house.

1321
01:15:08,642 --> 01:15:09,908
Yes.

1322
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:10,943
Mother.

1323
01:15:10,945 --> 01:15:13,045
Come on in. Straight
through to the drawing room.

1324
01:15:13,047 --> 01:15:14,580
- Here.
- Now,

1325
01:15:14,582 --> 01:15:17,883
I have a rather potent
Mesopotamian aperitif

1326
01:15:17,885 --> 01:15:19,785
that'll have you
thawed out in a jiffy.

1327
01:15:45,312 --> 01:15:48,047
I'm sorry again that you
had to find out like this.

1328
01:15:48,049 --> 01:15:50,651
Oh, I can't say it
came as a surprise.

1329
01:15:51,619 --> 01:15:53,320
Leo was a bad seed.

1330
01:15:54,155 --> 01:15:56,822
Always in trouble, he was.

1331
01:15:56,824 --> 01:15:58,791
He picked a fight the
night he took us out.

1332
01:15:58,793 --> 01:16:00,995
Mmm. Mervyn Cocker-Norris
at the hotel.

1333
01:16:01,796 --> 01:16:03,697
No. At the pictures.

1334
01:16:03,931 --> 01:16:04,965
Oh.

1335
01:16:13,174 --> 01:16:15,974
He turned on this tall
fella who came in after us

1336
01:16:15,976 --> 01:16:17,376
and shouted,

1337
01:16:17,378 --> 01:16:19,346
"What are you following
me for, buddy?"

1338
01:16:20,114 --> 01:16:21,814
And, um...

1339
01:16:21,816 --> 01:16:22,881
Did he know a good dentist,

1340
01:16:22,883 --> 01:16:24,852
'cause he was about to
lose a lot of teeth.

1341
01:16:26,654 --> 01:16:27,719
Hmm.

1342
01:16:27,721 --> 01:16:30,022
Right, who's ready for a top-up?

1343
01:16:30,024 --> 01:16:31,123
No.

1344
01:16:31,125 --> 01:16:32,724
Where's the old girl?

1345
01:16:32,726 --> 01:16:34,693
Not gonna play the
recluse card, is she?

1346
01:16:34,695 --> 01:16:36,862
Oh, no, no, no. She'll
be down soon enough.

1347
01:16:39,133 --> 01:16:40,799
That will be Fellowes.

1348
01:16:40,801 --> 01:16:42,236
The man's an oaf.

1349
01:16:46,774 --> 01:16:49,009
A tall fella, you say? Mmm.

1350
01:16:49,777 --> 01:16:51,278
Had a funny accent.

1351
01:16:53,114 --> 01:16:54,246
Italian?

1352
01:16:54,248 --> 01:16:55,747
No, not that funny.

1353
01:16:55,749 --> 01:16:56,984
More like...

1354
01:16:58,919 --> 01:17:00,287
a village idiot.

1355
01:17:04,792 --> 01:17:06,225
I'm sorry, but you
have to get out.

1356
01:17:08,929 --> 01:17:11,864
Oh. No. Good
heavens. No. Uh...

1357
01:17:11,866 --> 01:17:13,932
<i>Che cosa succede?</i>

1358
01:17:13,934 --> 01:17:15,267
<i>Poli... Polizei.</i>

1359
01:17:15,269 --> 01:17:16,768
<i>Telefono, por favor.</i>

1360
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:18,137
<i>Telefono?</i> Yes. <i>Si.</i>

1361
01:17:18,139 --> 01:17:19,705
<i>Sta la. Gracias.</i>

1362
01:17:22,109 --> 01:17:24,343
Scotland Yard, Sergeant
Bakewell speaking.

1363
01:17:24,345 --> 01:17:25,713
Yes, Stoppard here.

1364
01:17:30,985 --> 01:17:32,718
Police, stand back.

1365
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,419
He keeps a key...

1366
01:17:34,421 --> 01:17:35,756
under the mat.

1367
01:17:40,227 --> 01:17:42,161
<i>Let me guess, Inspector.</i>

1368
01:17:42,163 --> 01:17:44,062
<i>You're after an address.</i>

1369
01:17:44,064 --> 01:17:45,197
How did you know that?

1370
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:46,231
Constable Stalker, sir.

1371
01:17:46,233 --> 01:17:48,369
She called just now for
the same information.

1372
01:17:49,737 --> 01:17:50,838
Stalker?

1373
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:00,879
Agatha?

1374
01:18:00,881 --> 01:18:02,247
Gosh, is she all right?

1375
01:18:34,982 --> 01:18:37,117
Where's Agatha? What
have you done with her?

1376
01:18:44,925 --> 01:18:46,491
It was the usher, sir. I know.

1377
01:18:46,493 --> 01:18:48,227
He was under our
noses all this time.

1378
01:18:48,229 --> 01:18:50,429
Is he in? No, sir.
But I found this.

1379
01:18:50,431 --> 01:18:51,964
If we get going
now, sir, we can...

1380
01:18:51,966 --> 01:18:53,232
I can take it from
here, Constable.

1381
01:18:53,234 --> 01:18:54,866
Oh, right. And... And me, sir?

1382
01:18:54,868 --> 01:18:56,103
Go back to the station.

1383
01:18:57,271 --> 01:18:58,370
Yes, sir.

1384
01:18:58,372 --> 01:18:59,505
Oh, and, Constable?

1385
01:18:59,507 --> 01:19:01,173
Yes, sir?

1386
01:19:01,175 --> 01:19:03,010
Make a start on the paperwork.

1387
01:19:04,979 --> 01:19:06,278
Yes, sir.

1388
01:19:19,326 --> 01:19:22,361
Is it me, or does he
look awfully familiar?

1389
01:19:22,363 --> 01:19:25,833
It's Dennis. He's an
usher from the Ambassadors

1390
01:19:26,433 --> 01:19:28,200
Oh, Dennis!

1391
01:19:28,202 --> 01:19:29,569
So nice to see you.

1392
01:19:29,571 --> 01:19:31,336
This is a strange coincidence.

1393
01:19:31,338 --> 01:19:32,406
What are you doing here?

1394
01:19:33,374 --> 01:19:34,542
Well, I invited you.

1395
01:19:35,577 --> 01:19:37,309
Oh, my God.

1396
01:19:37,311 --> 01:19:39,046
You killed Leo and Mervyn!

1397
01:19:39,847 --> 01:19:41,280
I did.

1398
01:19:41,282 --> 01:19:43,915
I wanted to stop the
film and the play.

1399
01:19:43,917 --> 01:19:45,484
What film? What play?

1400
01:19:45,486 --> 01:19:46,885
<i>The Mousetrap!</i>

1401
01:19:46,887 --> 01:19:47,953
Now, look here, Dennis.

1402
01:19:47,955 --> 01:19:50,556
We all have strong
opinions on the theater.

1403
01:19:50,558 --> 01:19:52,858
In a sense, that's
what it's there for,

1404
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:54,860
to provoke emotion.

1405
01:19:54,862 --> 01:19:57,496
And I appreciate you don't
care for <i>The Mousetrap.</i>

1406
01:19:57,498 --> 01:20:01,099
I'll be the first to admit
it's not exactly <i>Hamlet.</i>

1407
01:20:01,101 --> 01:20:03,902
But you must see

1408
01:20:03,904 --> 01:20:05,904
that this is a bit
of an overreaction.

1409
01:20:05,906 --> 01:20:07,607
That's not what this is.

1410
01:20:07,609 --> 01:20:10,510
Then, what... what is this?

1411
01:20:10,512 --> 01:20:13,178
It's not your story to
tell, is it? It's mine.

1412
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:14,514
Oh, I might have known.

1413
01:20:14,516 --> 01:20:15,981
A disgruntled writer.

1414
01:20:15,983 --> 01:20:18,383
Don't tell me, you
had the idea first?

1415
01:20:18,385 --> 01:20:20,852
No. It happened to me.

1416
01:20:20,854 --> 01:20:22,087
I'm sorry, I am completely lost.

1417
01:20:22,089 --> 01:20:23,889
I don't have a
theatrical background.

1418
01:20:23,891 --> 01:20:26,226
You're not Dennis
Corrigan, are you?

1419
01:20:30,331 --> 01:20:31,999
Oh, you poor boy.

1420
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:33,865
How do you mean?

1421
01:20:33,867 --> 01:20:36,301
He lost his brother
in real life.

1422
01:20:36,303 --> 01:20:38,303
Dreadful business, it was.

1423
01:20:38,305 --> 01:20:40,606
It was years ago, now.
I told you about it.

1424
01:20:40,608 --> 01:20:43,041
It was the case <i>The
Mousetrap</i> was based on.

1425
01:20:43,043 --> 01:20:45,977
Inspired by,
Mother. And loosely.

1426
01:20:45,979 --> 01:20:47,647
Oh, but you're an usher.

1427
01:20:47,649 --> 01:20:50,382
You had to watch that
play night after night.

1428
01:20:50,384 --> 01:20:52,052
It must've been torture.

1429
01:20:53,087 --> 01:20:55,655
I thought it would help.

1430
01:20:55,657 --> 01:20:57,623
<i>He was only six when
he died, my brother.</i>

1431
01:20:57,625 --> 01:21:00,526
<i>The Mousetrap</i> is actually
based on a real-life case.

1432
01:21:00,528 --> 01:21:02,994
<i>Neglected and left
for dead by the people</i>

1433
01:21:02,996 --> 01:21:05,364
<i>who were supposed
to look after us.</i>

1434
01:21:05,366 --> 01:21:09,301
<i>It sold a lot of newspapers,
but no one cared about us.</i>

1435
01:21:11,438 --> 01:21:13,939
<i>I thought the play
would be different.</i>

1436
01:21:13,941 --> 01:21:16,509
<i>A famous writer was
going to tell our story.</i>

1437
01:21:16,511 --> 01:21:20,078
Two brothers who put their faith
in the British social services.

1438
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:23,048
<i>But when I saw what
Agatha Christie had done,</i>

1439
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:26,985
<i>used our pain and suffering as a
motive for a deranged killer...</i>

1440
01:21:28,489 --> 01:21:30,656
<i>my brother's death reduced
to a cheap sideshow...</i>

1441
01:21:30,658 --> 01:21:32,457
There's been a murder?

1442
01:21:32,459 --> 01:21:34,025
<i>I knew he wouldn't be able</i>

1443
01:21:34,027 --> 01:21:36,294
<i>to rest in peace
until the play ended.</i>

1444
01:21:36,296 --> 01:21:38,964
But it didn't.

1445
01:21:38,966 --> 01:21:42,000
It just went on, and on, and on.

1446
01:21:42,002 --> 01:21:44,336
<i>The Mousetrap</i> is 100, not out.

1447
01:21:44,338 --> 01:21:46,304
<i>When I heard about
the film adaptation,</i>

1448
01:21:46,306 --> 01:21:48,340
<i>I just snapped.</i>

1449
01:21:48,342 --> 01:21:51,143
Without me, there is no
movie. You understand?

1450
01:21:51,145 --> 01:21:52,411
You got a problem, buddy?

1451
01:21:52,413 --> 01:21:55,147
<i>I killed the director
to stop the film,</i>

1452
01:21:55,149 --> 01:21:58,283
<i>and thought a corpse on the stage
would put an end to the play.</i>

1453
01:22:00,154 --> 01:22:02,187
<i>But they didn't even
close the theater.</i>

1454
01:22:02,189 --> 01:22:03,689
Do you think you might
be finished in time

1455
01:22:03,691 --> 01:22:05,257
for curtain up tomorrow night?

1456
01:22:05,259 --> 01:22:07,159
<i>And Mervyn's new
ideas for the film</i>

1457
01:22:07,161 --> 01:22:08,694
<i>made me sick to my stomach.</i>

1458
01:22:08,696 --> 01:22:10,429
I'll take the bare
bones of the story,

1459
01:22:10,431 --> 01:22:14,634
a rather mundane tale of child
abuse, and make it my own.

1460
01:22:14,636 --> 01:22:16,067
<i>He left me no choice.</i>

1461
01:22:17,137 --> 01:22:19,070
You startled me.

1462
01:22:19,072 --> 01:22:20,508
<i>I had to kill him, too.</i>

1463
01:22:23,277 --> 01:22:25,611
<i>I thought that would
be the end of it.</i>

1464
01:22:25,613 --> 01:22:28,182
But you all just carried on
like nothing had happened.

1465
01:22:29,684 --> 01:22:31,116
Shame on you.

1466
01:22:33,053 --> 01:22:36,457
Well, maybe you'll take notice if
I kill Agatha Christie herself.

1467
01:22:40,595 --> 01:22:42,194
Oh, I think she's
tryin' to say something.

1468
01:22:42,196 --> 01:22:43,663
Oh, for God's sake, let her out.

1469
01:22:43,665 --> 01:22:44,730
I'll stop the film.

1470
01:22:44,732 --> 01:22:46,766
And the play.
This is barbaric.

1471
01:22:46,768 --> 01:22:48,035
Fine.

1472
01:22:55,275 --> 01:22:57,209
Edana?

1473
01:22:57,211 --> 01:22:59,377
Darling, what... what
are you doing here?

1474
01:22:59,379 --> 01:23:01,313
I followed you.

1475
01:23:01,315 --> 01:23:03,348
I suppose I was going
to make a scene.

1476
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:05,283
Hello, Ann.

1477
01:23:05,285 --> 01:23:08,721
Then this beanpole assaulted
me, and I woke up in a carpet.

1478
01:23:08,723 --> 01:23:11,557
If you're not Agatha Christie,
where the hell is she?

1479
01:23:11,559 --> 01:23:13,391
Good God, man. You
mean you don't know?

1480
01:23:13,393 --> 01:23:16,228
What kind of a bumbling,
half-witted psychopath are you?

1481
01:23:16,230 --> 01:23:18,298
Will you be quiet! Please!

1482
01:23:18,733 --> 01:23:20,600
Let me think!

1483
01:23:20,602 --> 01:23:22,400
Yes, of course! Of
course. Why don't you...

1484
01:23:22,402 --> 01:23:25,370
Why don't you come in and
sit down, Dennis? Um...

1485
01:23:25,372 --> 01:23:27,172
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1486
01:23:27,174 --> 01:23:29,542
Have a little
moment to yourself.

1487
01:24:39,681 --> 01:24:40,715
What?

1488
01:25:02,637 --> 01:25:05,403
Uh, well... Um...

1489
01:25:05,405 --> 01:25:08,473
I, for one, believe that, uh,

1490
01:25:08,475 --> 01:25:10,810
Dennis here is owed an apology.

1491
01:25:10,812 --> 01:25:12,210
Yes.

1492
01:25:12,212 --> 01:25:14,346
He... He's right, of course.

1493
01:25:14,348 --> 01:25:15,881
The truth is the truth.

1494
01:25:15,883 --> 01:25:18,818
It is not to be
manipulated or played with,

1495
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:20,620
and certainly not
for entertainment.

1496
01:25:20,622 --> 01:25:22,287
- No, no.
- No, no, no.

1497
01:25:22,289 --> 01:25:24,590
Art is supposed to
reveal the truth...

1498
01:25:24,592 --> 01:25:25,658
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1499
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:27,693
Not pervert it.

1500
01:25:27,695 --> 01:25:29,895
How would Agatha
Christie like it

1501
01:25:29,897 --> 01:25:31,864
if someone took
one of her stories

1502
01:25:31,866 --> 01:25:34,432
and twisted it and corrupted it

1503
01:25:34,434 --> 01:25:36,569
just for the hell of it?

1504
01:25:36,571 --> 01:25:38,638
She wouldn't.

1505
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:41,206
I... I think that
we should all feel

1506
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:42,742
thoroughly ashamed of ourselves.

1507
01:25:42,744 --> 01:25:45,343
Oh, here we are.
Tea for everyone.

1508
01:25:45,345 --> 01:25:46,545
There you are, my dear.

1509
01:25:46,547 --> 01:25:48,446
Sorry to have kept you.

1510
01:25:48,448 --> 01:25:50,484
No, no, please don't get
up, not on my account.

1511
01:25:50,918 --> 01:25:52,217
There, there.

1512
01:25:52,219 --> 01:25:53,284
No, no, no,

1513
01:25:53,286 --> 01:25:54,587
no, no, it's fine. Be careful.

1514
01:25:54,589 --> 01:25:58,289
Just as it was. I
think it was that way.

1515
01:25:58,291 --> 01:26:00,225
It is so nice to see
you again, Agatha,

1516
01:26:00,227 --> 01:26:01,527
in spite of the circumstances.

1517
01:26:01,529 --> 01:26:02,728
No, no, no, not that one.

1518
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:04,699
No, that's for Dennis.

1519
01:26:07,902 --> 01:26:09,436
It is Dennis, isn't it?

1520
01:26:10,738 --> 01:26:12,370
There we are.

1521
01:26:12,372 --> 01:26:14,940
I put an extra lump in.

1522
01:26:14,942 --> 01:26:16,474
Thank you.

1523
01:26:16,476 --> 01:26:18,577
Everyone else, help themselves.

1524
01:26:20,414 --> 01:26:22,414
Now, Dennis.

1525
01:26:22,416 --> 01:26:23,616
How can I help?

1526
01:26:23,618 --> 01:26:25,450
Why don't we sit here
and drink our tea

1527
01:26:25,452 --> 01:26:28,455
and discuss the matter
like civilized people, hmm?

1528
01:26:29,924 --> 01:26:31,957
I want you to stop
<i>The Mousetrap.</i>

1529
01:26:31,959 --> 01:26:35,326
Oh, I am sorry, but
that I cannot do. No.

1530
01:26:35,328 --> 01:26:38,764
I'm afraid it goes against
everything I hold dear in life.

1531
01:26:38,766 --> 01:26:41,266
Yes. I'm a writer, you see.

1532
01:26:41,268 --> 01:26:44,570
I can't be told what to
write or what not to write.

1533
01:26:44,572 --> 01:26:47,542
It would be a denial
of one's freedom.

1534
01:26:48,543 --> 01:26:52,580
Do you see, Dennis?
Hmm? Do drink up.

1535
01:27:17,839 --> 01:27:19,306
Oh, good God, Fellowes.

1536
01:27:20,775 --> 01:27:22,307
Get up. Get up.

1537
01:27:22,309 --> 01:27:23,776
Now, look here, young man, I...

1538
01:27:23,778 --> 01:27:25,613
Max!

1539
01:27:46,868 --> 01:27:48,567
- Yes, good idea... Oh.
- Yes.

1540
01:27:48,569 --> 01:27:51,469
Oh, my God. Now
what's happened?

1541
01:28:06,821 --> 01:28:08,488
Oh.

1542
01:28:09,489 --> 01:28:10,525
Dennis.

1543
01:28:12,627 --> 01:28:14,929
Put the popular author
down, please, Dennis.

1544
01:28:15,530 --> 01:28:16,798
No.

1545
01:28:20,868 --> 01:28:23,569
Sheila, darling,
now's hardly the time.

1546
01:28:23,571 --> 01:28:25,538
Dickie, I need a light.

1547
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:26,908
But you don't smoke.

1548
01:28:27,708 --> 01:28:29,010
Dickie.

1549
01:29:04,444 --> 01:29:05,546
Look out!

1550
01:29:06,781 --> 01:29:07,880
No, Dennis!

1551
01:29:07,882 --> 01:29:10,518
Don't do it, please!

1552
01:29:16,423 --> 01:29:18,090
Darling!

1553
01:29:18,092 --> 01:29:20,593
It's all right.

1554
01:29:20,595 --> 01:29:22,763
He's dead. It's over.

1555
01:29:26,433 --> 01:29:27,434
Sir...

1556
01:29:28,669 --> 01:29:29,804
I'm bleedin'.

1557
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:35,174
Hang in there, Constable.

1558
01:29:35,176 --> 01:29:37,442
Sergeant's exam's in a month.

1559
01:29:37,444 --> 01:29:39,645
It's funny, sir. I actually...
I don't feel anything.

1560
01:29:39,647 --> 01:29:41,013
I think it mighta
just been a nick.

1561
01:29:41,015 --> 01:29:43,582
Yeah. Just the nick
of time, I'd say.

1562
01:29:43,584 --> 01:29:44,917
Very good.

1563
01:29:44,919 --> 01:29:48,187
I'm sorry, Constable.

1564
01:29:48,189 --> 01:29:50,556
I haven't been
altogether honest or open

1565
01:29:50,558 --> 01:29:53,192
or loyal or fair to
you as a partner.

1566
01:29:53,194 --> 01:29:57,563
Truth be told, I haven't been
a partner at all, you know.

1567
01:29:57,565 --> 01:29:58,764
Sir, you don't have to say that.

1568
01:29:58,766 --> 01:30:00,699
No, I want you to know...

1569
01:30:00,701 --> 01:30:02,034
I do trust you.

1570
01:30:02,036 --> 01:30:04,469
Thank you, sir. That
does mean a lot.

1571
01:30:04,471 --> 01:30:06,739
Um, but when I say that
I can't feel anything,

1572
01:30:06,741 --> 01:30:09,508
I think what I mean is that, um,

1573
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:11,911
I don't think the
bullet hit me, sir.

1574
01:30:11,913 --> 01:30:12,980
What do you mean?

1575
01:30:13,981 --> 01:30:15,182
Did you, um...

1576
01:30:16,617 --> 01:30:18,717
- Oh, I see.
- Oh, no. Yeah.

1577
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:20,753
Oh. Well, you're right
again, Constable.

1578
01:30:20,755 --> 01:30:21,854
Are you all right, sir?

1579
01:30:21,856 --> 01:30:23,188
I think you better
call an ambulance.

1580
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:24,424
Yep.

1581
01:30:25,793 --> 01:30:27,828
Yes, I don't feel so good.

1582
01:30:29,697 --> 01:30:31,931
A shoot-out and a big explosion.

1583
01:30:31,933 --> 01:30:35,102
Perhaps it's for the best that
Mervyn wasn't alive to see it.

1584
01:30:36,170 --> 01:30:37,204
Quite.

1585
01:31:08,135 --> 01:31:10,972
It's okay, everyone,
I'm... I'm fine.

1586
01:31:16,077 --> 01:31:20,548
<i>Now that's what I call
a Leo Kopernick ending.</i>

1587
01:31:22,049 --> 01:31:24,650
<i>But before we go
our separate ways,</i>

1588
01:31:24,652 --> 01:31:28,589
<i>you'll be wanting to know what
became of the heroes of this tale.</i>

1589
01:31:31,258 --> 01:31:33,692
<i>Constable Stalker,
as advertised,</i>

1590
01:31:33,694 --> 01:31:37,296
<i>sat her sergeant's exams
in the spring of 1953.</i>

1591
01:31:40,101 --> 01:31:41,869
