GABRIEL:
Take the child and his mother...

819
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:02,349
...and flee to Egypt...

820
01:32:02,558 --> 01:32:06,144
...and remain there until I bring you word.

MARY:
The Almighty has done great things.

822
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:40,178
And holy is His name.

823
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:47,060
He has shown strength with His arm.

824
01:32:51,107 --> 01:32:53,400
He has scattered the proud.

825
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:05,203
He has filled the hungry with good things.

826
01:33:07,206 --> 01:33:11,251
And the rich he has sent away empty.

827
01:33:19,051 --> 01:33:22,554
He has brought down rulers
from their thrones...

828
01:33:24,765 --> 01:33:28,643
...and has exalted
those who were humble.
