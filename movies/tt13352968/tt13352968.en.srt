00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:49,413
Ciao.
- Bye.

3
00:03:35,388 --> 00:03:38,130
Hello!
I'm Leo. You must be Nancy.

4
00:03:38,173 --> 00:03:39,610
That's right.

5
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:42,526
May I come inside?
- Yes, of course. Yes, of course.

6
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:50,882
May I kiss you on the cheek?

7
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,711
Yes, that would be fine.

8
00:04:00,195 --> 00:04:01,849
You smell wonderful.
- Thank you.

9
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:04,156
What is it?
- Coco Chanel.

10
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,331
Nigel la Lawson wears it.

11
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,942
Ah, Nigel la. So sexy.

12
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:10,989
Don't you agree?

13
00:04:11,032 --> 00:04:14,340
Yes, no, I... I was waiting
for you to say, "for her age".

14
00:04:14,384 --> 00:04:17,691
Most people say, when a woman's over
about 42, that she's sexy "for her age."

15
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:19,563
I was waiting...
I was waiting for that.

16
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:23,306
Ah, right. Uh, no, Nigel la Lawson
is empirically sexy, at any age.

17
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:28,702
Hey, Nancy?
- Yes?

18
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:31,009
We're gonna have a great time.
- OK.

19
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:32,140
OK.

20
00:04:45,197 --> 00:04:46,720
I tell you what
I'd love right now...

21
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:48,374
What?
- A drink.

22
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:50,463
A drink, of course,
of course. Sorry.

23
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:52,335
What can I get you?

24
00:04:52,378 --> 00:04:54,225
How about a glass of fizz
to ease us into the mood.

25
00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:56,208
A glass of fizz. Hold on.

26
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:00,517
Allow me.

27
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:14,966
For you.
- Thanks very much.

28
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,016
To being empirically sexy.

29
00:05:23,714 --> 00:05:26,194
Yes. I'll drink to that.

30
00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:33,114
A very fine vintage.

31
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:34,812
It's just from the minibar.

32
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,859
Oh, you meant me.

33
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:40,121
Me.
- I'm just teasing.

34
00:05:40,165 --> 00:05:41,775
Righto, righto.
- Shall we sit?

35
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:42,820
Yes, let's sit.

36
00:05:51,132 --> 00:05:53,439
So, what would you...
- So, you enjoy music...

37
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:54,962
by people?

38
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:56,790
Yeah, I do.

39
00:05:57,487 --> 00:05:59,358
What kind of music do you like?

40
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,405
Oh, I don't know.
All sorts, um...

41
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:05,233
Sorry, I'm a bit
distracted cos, um...

42
00:06:06,017 --> 00:06:08,585
cos up close you really are
very good-looking.

43
00:06:09,324 --> 00:06:11,370
Mm.
- Thank you.

44
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,634
Even more than in your photo.

45
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:16,027
Ah, I'm better in 3D.

46
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:18,681
Mm.

47
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,685
I hope that you received, um...

48
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:23,687
the contractual.

49
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,558
Oh, the money?

50
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:28,300
The money, yes, sorry. I didn't
want to be crass and just say it.

51
00:06:28,343 --> 00:06:32,260
There's nothing crass about getting paid
for your work, Nancy, trust me on that.

52
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:34,306
And thank you,
it's all received.

53
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:38,266
Are you Irish?
- Yes, I am.

54
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:41,313
Have you been doing this long?

55
00:06:41,356 --> 00:06:43,663
A little while now, yeah.

56
00:06:44,142 --> 00:06:45,883
Long enough to know some things.

57
00:06:45,926 --> 00:06:46,884
Do you enjoy it?

58
00:06:46,927 --> 00:06:48,668
You know what? I love it, Nancy.

59
00:06:48,712 --> 00:06:53,107
Meeting all kinds of people,
getting up to all sorts of things...

60
00:06:53,673 --> 00:06:55,153
mutual pleasure.

61
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:58,286
You don't feel... demeaned then?

62
00:07:01,376 --> 00:07:02,552
Not at all.

63
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,902
Or degraded?
- No.

64
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:07,731
But what if you meet someone
and you really just...

65
00:07:07,774 --> 00:07:09,559
don't want to do it?

66
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:10,995
Hasn't happened yet.

67
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:12,083
Really?
- Really.

68
00:07:12,126 --> 00:07:13,258
I find that astonishing.

69
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:16,479
How many have you...
- Oh, a gentleman never tells.

70
00:07:16,522 --> 00:07:18,045
Oh, of course, yes.

71
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,571
You don't have to worry, Nancy.
This is just about us tonight.

72
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,443
So, what is your fantasy?

73
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:27,272
Um...

74
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:31,015
I'm not sure you could really
class it as a fantasy as such.

75
00:07:31,058 --> 00:07:32,756
It's a bit mundane for that.

76
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:35,672
OK, well, what
would you most desire?

77
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:37,587
I mean, desires
are never mundane.

78
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:40,024
Um...

79
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:43,941
to have sex...

80
00:07:45,246 --> 00:07:47,118
tonight, um, with you.

81
00:07:48,728 --> 00:07:50,861
That's about it, really.

82
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,340
For the moment.

83
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:54,168
Great.
- But do you mind?

84
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:56,388
Do you want... I mean, am I...

85
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,434
...a disappointment,
so to speak?

86
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:17,322
OK?

87
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:19,411
OK, OK.
- Top-up?

88
00:08:19,454 --> 00:08:20,454
Yes, please.

89
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:31,031
Thank you.

90
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,822
I'm sorry, I just can't bear
the suspense.

91
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:41,085
Can... Could we...

92
00:08:41,128 --> 00:08:43,087
Would it be alright
if we just did it now?

93
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,350
Right now? And get it over with?

94
00:08:45,393 --> 00:08:46,960
Get it over with?
- Yes.

95
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:48,962
You're meant to enjoy it.

96
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:51,201
No, I know that, I'm just not very
good at waiting for things to happen.

97
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:53,924
I'm much better when they've
happened and I'm... recovering.

98
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:57,667
You make it sound like it's
an ordeal. It's not compulsory.

99
00:08:58,493 --> 00:09:00,495
Shall we just sit and chat
for a bit?

100
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:02,019
Oh no, I don't want to do that.

101
00:09:02,062 --> 00:09:03,605
I don't think we'd
have very much in common.

102
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:06,240
You might be surprised.
- I am very rarely surprised.

103
00:09:06,806 --> 00:09:09,374
I like to plan things properly,
specifically

104
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:11,681
in order to avoid
being surprised, if I'm honest.

105
00:09:11,724 --> 00:09:15,075
Fine, but I hope
I can surprise you anyway.

106
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:18,992
N... No, I don't want anything
like that.

107
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:20,124
Anything like what?

108
00:09:20,646 --> 00:09:22,387
You know, anything perverted.

109
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:25,172
Oh, no, no, no.
Not that kind of surprise.

110
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:27,566
Oh good, I don't like anything
going in to places

111
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,612
that are designed for
things to come out.

112
00:09:29,655 --> 00:09:31,222
You're talking about anal sex?

113
00:09:31,265 --> 00:09:32,702
I don't like that phrase.

114
00:09:32,745 --> 00:09:35,705
Nancy, I won't be doing anything
you don't want me to do.

115
00:09:35,748 --> 00:09:37,707
I've never done
anything like this before.

116
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,926
I've never bought
anybody like this for my own...

117
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,362
Pleasure.
- ...use.

118
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:46,498
Nancy, listen to me. I choose to do this.
- Yes. Right.

119
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:50,676
You know, you haven't bought me,
you've bought my service.

120
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:52,983
I set a price and you agreed.

121
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,159
I'm not being exploited.

122
00:09:55,202 --> 00:09:57,857
I can't bear the suspense.
I can't bear it.

123
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:59,554
The anticipation?
- Yes...

124
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,296
of disappointment.

125
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,298
Why do you assume
you'll be disappointed?

126
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:12,219
Because I've always been
disappointed before.

127
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:17,442
I need to... Well, actually,
I'd like to tell you something.

128
00:10:17,485 --> 00:10:18,617
OK.

129
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:20,358
I've never had an orgasm.

130
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:23,970
With a partner?
- With anyone.

131
00:10:24,405 --> 00:10:26,886
Or by yourself?
- No. Not even by myself.

132
00:10:27,408 --> 00:10:29,019
N... Never.

133
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,150
That's right.

134
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,326
Right. I see.

135
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,764
It's not meant as a challenge.
- I haven't taken it as one.

136
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:37,244
Cos you won't be able to achieve it.
- Fair enough.

137
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,510
Your confidence is endearing,
and no doubt necessary to the job

138
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:45,209
but I feel I must warn you
it is misplaced.

139
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:47,733
Um, and I don't want
you to feel bad about it

140
00:10:47,777 --> 00:10:50,431
because I won't be faking it.
I don't do that. Not anymore.

141
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:53,478
Um, I made a decision
after my husband died

142
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:55,132
never to fake an orgasm again.

143
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,310
When did he die?

144
00:10:59,353 --> 00:11:01,616
Uh, two years ago.
It was premature.

145
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:04,881
And is this your first...

146
00:11:04,924 --> 00:11:08,536
Encounter since then? Yes.
In fact, if we do this, you will...

147
00:11:10,408 --> 00:11:13,150
...only be the second man I have
ever had sex with in my entire life.

148
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:16,414
There, I said it.

149
00:11:16,457 --> 00:11:17,937
Well, thank you for telling me.

150
00:11:18,851 --> 00:11:23,029
If you want to leave now, I'm very
happy to pay half of what we agreed.

151
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:26,946
I don't want to leave, Nancy.

152
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:30,341
Nothing is
making me want to leave.

153
00:11:31,472 --> 00:11:33,779
I won't leave unless I'm clearly
instructed to

154
00:11:33,823 --> 00:11:35,389
or I feel I'm
in physical danger.

155
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:39,350
Has that ever happened?
- Yeah. A couple of times.

156
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,614
With a woman?
- Yeah. Once with a woman.

157
00:11:42,657 --> 00:11:45,443
Well, her husband, he thought...
He wanted a threesome.

158
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:46,792
But it turned out he didn't.

159
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:48,925
Did she?
- No...

160
00:11:48,968 --> 00:11:51,188
but she did want to meet
one-on-one a week later.

161
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:53,886
And did you do that?
- Sure.

162
00:11:54,974 --> 00:11:57,107
Wasn't that dishonest?
- Of her?

163
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,195
Of you.

164
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:02,721
Why? I mean, I'm not the married
one. I'm just doing my job.

165
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:06,289
Wow.

166
00:12:07,595 --> 00:12:09,075
It's all quite an education.

167
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:10,642
I hope it continues.

168
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:13,340
You're being saucy.

169
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:17,083
"Saucy"? My grandmother
used to say the word "saucy".

170
00:12:17,127 --> 00:12:19,192
I'd rather not think about
your grandmother right now

171
00:12:19,216 --> 00:12:20,260
if you don't mind.

172
00:12:20,304 --> 00:12:21,827
No problem.
- I just... Anyway...

173
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:24,221
I just wanted to let you know
about the orgasm thing.

174
00:12:24,264 --> 00:12:26,789
I'm not expecting one, so um,
you can relax.

175
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:29,139
I am relaxed.

176
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:31,054
This was a terrible idea.

177
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:37,364
Do you feel you're somehow
betraying your husband?

178
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:39,584
His memory, I mean.

179
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:42,674
What? Oh no, no, no, no, no.

180
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:44,545
No, it's nothing like that.
- Then what?

181
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:47,461
It's just not very "me", I'm a
teacher... Well, I was a teacher

182
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:51,074
I... I used to set my pupils essays on
the moral issues surrounding sex work

183
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:53,728
and here I am... participating in it.
- Nancy.

184
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:56,316
You're probably a very vulnerable
young man, maybe you're an orphan.

185
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,211
I'm not an orphan.

186
00:12:58,255 --> 00:13:00,102
Yeah, or perhaps you grew up in
care, you've got very low self-esteem.

187
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:01,824
I didn't grow up in care.

188
00:13:01,867 --> 00:13:03,714
You could've been trafficked
against your will, you can't tell

189
00:13:03,738 --> 00:13:05,586
just by looking at somebody.
- I wasn't trafficked against my will.

190
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,197
Well, then I simply don't understand it.
- You don't understand what?

191
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,353
Why you're doing this.

192
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,704
Oh. Oh, well, if
you really want to know

193
00:13:12,747 --> 00:13:16,708
I'm... I'm using the money I make
doing this to save up for college.

194
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:17,751
Oh.

195
00:13:18,405 --> 00:13:20,930
Oh, how wonderful.
Are you really?

196
00:13:21,887 --> 00:13:22,975
No.

197
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:24,281
Oh.

198
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:28,198
Nancy, you need to stop worrying
about me...

199
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,026
...let's move this
back to you.

200
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:31,854
OK. Oh, God.
- Now, Nancy...

201
00:13:31,897 --> 00:13:34,117
This is crazy, it's terrible, it's wrong.
- Nancy.

202
00:13:34,508 --> 00:13:36,902
My son... My son
would be appalled.

203
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:38,034
Nancy.
- Yes.

204
00:13:38,077 --> 00:13:39,557
Let's go to bed.
- OK.

205
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,037
OK?

206
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,429
OK.
- Good.

207
00:13:45,606 --> 00:13:46,825
Come here.
- Mm-hmm.

208
00:13:50,437 --> 00:13:51,699
Is this OK?

209
00:13:59,098 --> 00:14:00,752
OK?
- Mm.

210
00:14:00,795 --> 00:14:01,840
Mm-hmm.

211
00:14:12,807 --> 00:14:13,983
Mm.

212
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:28,823
Listen, er, if you, um,
need to take anything

213
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:29,694
that's fine by me.

214
00:14:29,737 --> 00:14:30,913
I'm fine, Nancy.

215
00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:32,958
I mean legal things, you know,
to help...

216
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:35,265
with it all down there.
- No, I assure you, it all works.

217
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,180
I know, I mean, I just...

218
00:14:37,223 --> 00:14:39,783
No, I know what you mean, but
I don't need any little blue pills.

219
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:41,575
Never?
- Never.

220
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:43,534
But what if you
don't fancy the person?

221
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:46,276
I mean, you can't force
yourself, surely, if you don't.

222
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,973
There's always
something to fancy.

223
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:49,453
No, there isn't.
- There is.

224
00:14:49,496 --> 00:14:50,541
Oh.

225
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:53,848
What's the oldest person
you've ever done it with?

226
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:55,459
That's a bit reductive, Nancy.

227
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,288
"Reductive", that's a good word.
I like it.

228
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:00,116
Yes, it is a good word.

229
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:02,335
I'm glad you like it.
I chose it just for you.

230
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:03,684
But seriously

231
00:15:03,728 --> 00:15:05,730
actually I really do
want to know, how old?

232
00:15:08,385 --> 00:15:09,821
Eighty-two.
- Eighty-two?

233
00:15:09,864 --> 00:15:11,083
Yes.
- Eighty-two!

234
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:12,389
Yeah.
- Eighty-two.

235
00:15:12,432 --> 00:15:13,432
Nancy.

236
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:17,089
OK, I'm feeling a bit better now.
- OK.

237
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:18,177
Um...

238
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:21,311
So, what's the
little thing about me

239
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:24,053
that you can hold onto
with all your might?

240
00:15:25,184 --> 00:15:27,360
To make you come alive
in the moment?

241
00:15:30,102 --> 00:15:31,190
Come here.

242
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:43,333
I like your mouth.

243
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:52,559
I like the line of your neck,
down to about here.

244
00:15:58,609 --> 00:15:59,740
And this...

245
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:02,830
it's so elegant.

246
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,880
Um, just... hang on a second.

247
00:16:08,923 --> 00:16:12,710
I'll just, um... I'll just go
to the bathroom and change.

248
00:16:12,753 --> 00:16:14,103
OK, but don't change too much.

249
00:16:14,146 --> 00:16:15,234
Oh, God.

250
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,092
Ta-dah.

251
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:15,920
Ooh!

252
00:18:15,963 --> 00:18:17,139
You look great.

253
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,281
Oh, um, everything OK?

254
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:32,154
Yes, it's just, I don't like
Mars bars. I can smell it.

255
00:18:32,197 --> 00:18:33,503
It's a bit off-putting.

256
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,461
Oh, sorry, sorry.
I'll go and clean my teeth.

257
00:18:35,505 --> 00:18:37,115
Would you mind? Thank you.

258
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:05,274
What's this?

259
00:19:11,105 --> 00:19:13,151
Very nice.
- I've changed my mind again.

260
00:19:13,804 --> 00:19:16,546
I don't want to do it. I'm
sorry to have wasted your time.

261
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,069
You... I'll still pay.

262
00:19:18,112 --> 00:19:19,984
But you can get dressed and go.

263
00:19:25,424 --> 00:19:27,209
This isn't about
the Mars bar, is it?

264
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:29,602
No, it's not about the Mars bar.

265
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:31,256
Do you not find me attractive?

266
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,692
Don't be ridiculous.

267
00:19:33,127 --> 00:19:34,303
You're clearly...

268
00:19:35,304 --> 00:19:38,002
aesthetically perfect,
and apparently nice enough.

269
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:41,484
What did you picture happening,
I mean...

270
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:45,009
why did you book me
if you don't want to do it?

271
00:19:45,052 --> 00:19:48,578
I don't know at this point.
A moment of madness, that's all.

272
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:49,840
That's all.

273
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,930
Do you regularly have moments
of madness like this?

274
00:19:52,973 --> 00:19:53,973
No.

275
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:57,021
Do you usually
make rational decisions?

276
00:19:57,978 --> 00:19:59,110
Yes.

277
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,505
Then why would
this be any different?

278
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:05,203
I mean, you must
have had a reason.

279
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:09,033
Something that made you do it. I bet
you thought about it for days before.

280
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,515
Weeks... Well,
months. Years, perhaps.

281
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:15,257
Well, then it's
not a moment of madness.

282
00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:19,348
This is what you want, Nancy.

283
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:22,742
And now that you have it,
why won't you take it?

284
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,225
Why won't you take what you want
when it's right here, within reach.

285
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:31,142
Oh, I don't know.
It feels controversial suddenly.

286
00:20:31,185 --> 00:20:32,796
I don't find it controversial.

287
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:35,538
To want something
like this. Even to want it.

288
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:42,196
If it's just sex you want

289
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,895
aren't there a dozen men around
who'd love to hook up with you?

290
00:20:44,938 --> 00:20:47,637
If it's all too much...
I mean, surely they want to.

291
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,247
Oh, yeah... Yes, they do, um...

292
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,337
Yes, they made that very clear
actually since Robert died

293
00:20:52,381 --> 00:20:54,383
but um, it's
me, I don't want to.

294
00:20:54,426 --> 00:20:55,558
Why not?

295
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:57,473
They're all old.

296
00:20:58,082 --> 00:21:01,172
Old men. I don't want an
old man. I want a young one.

297
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:06,177
A young body. And no of fence, I
have to pay for that, of course I do.

298
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:10,703
Well, I'm here,
and I'm not offended.

299
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:12,749
Actually, why
are you still here?

300
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:15,118
I've just offered to pay you to spend
an evening doing whatever you please.

301
00:21:15,142 --> 00:21:16,143
Why are you still here?

302
00:21:16,187 --> 00:21:17,188
I'm interested.
- In what?

303
00:21:17,231 --> 00:21:18,470
In you.
- Oh, for Heaven's sakes

304
00:21:18,494 --> 00:21:19,930
no need to patronise me.
- I'm not.

305
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:21,932
You're conflicted.

306
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:24,804
Conflicted is interesting.

307
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:27,957
You've never met a woman who can't make
up her mind before? I don't believe that.

308
00:21:27,981 --> 00:21:30,854
I've met women who can't decide
which sandwich to have for lunch

309
00:21:30,897 --> 00:21:34,510
but if we've ended up in a bedroom
together, they usually know what they want

310
00:21:34,553 --> 00:21:35,685
at that point.

311
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:37,382
Well, young women are different.

312
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:38,470
Yes, I think they are.

313
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:42,822
Different to how we were...
well, how I was when I was young.

314
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:46,652
I wasn't actually
a social renegade, anyway.

315
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:50,264
A couple of my friends were,
but we lost touch after school.

316
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:53,180
But London was a
different country back then.

317
00:21:53,224 --> 00:21:56,575
The rest of us were stuck
in the 1950s, it was repressive.

318
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:57,837
Sorry.

319
00:21:57,881 --> 00:21:59,143
And I wasn't brimming

320
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:00,773
with sexual confidence
like they all are now

321
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:03,539
with their thigh-split dresses
and salsa classes and whatnot.

322
00:22:03,582 --> 00:22:06,716
I mean, people do pole dancing
for a hobby.

323
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,979
I've read about it,
I read an article about it.

324
00:22:09,588 --> 00:22:11,416
I mean, a hobby?

325
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,939
Wh... I...

326
00:22:12,983 --> 00:22:14,724
Christ, I sound so old.

327
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:17,553
I know I sound old, but
Leo, did you ever meet anyone

328
00:22:17,596 --> 00:22:20,251
who does pole
dancing for a hobby?

329
00:22:20,294 --> 00:22:22,166
I think that's
mainly for posh girls.

330
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:23,994
Yes, you're probably right.

331
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:27,432
I mean, I know pole dancers
but they wouldn't pay to do it.

332
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:30,392
That's just some fucked up
economics, do you know what I mean?

333
00:22:30,435 --> 00:22:32,437
Not really, but I mean,
I can imagine.

334
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:34,134
It's not a world
I know much about.

335
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,921
Says the woman who booked a
hotel and a sex worker for the night.

336
00:22:37,964 --> 00:22:40,576
Oh, God. Oh, oh, you're right.

337
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:42,882
Oh, God, I'm just
a seedy old pervert.

338
00:22:42,926 --> 00:22:46,190
Just go. It's disgusting. I feel
like Rolf Harris all of a sudden.

339
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,018
Rolf Harris?

340
00:22:48,975 --> 00:22:50,020
Never mind.

341
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:53,545
Come on, let's get in the bed.

342
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:55,852
Let's get under the covers.

343
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:01,901
Why do they
make these things like...

344
00:23:01,945 --> 00:23:03,512
getting into a straight-jacket?

345
00:23:03,555 --> 00:23:04,687
It's ridiculous.

346
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:21,355
What do you really want to do
with your life?

347
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:25,055
I'd like to see, er,
Venus before I die.

348
00:23:25,098 --> 00:23:26,360
OK.

349
00:23:27,057 --> 00:23:30,452
I'm just curious about
what it's like for you.

350
00:23:30,495 --> 00:23:32,018
You're clearly very bright.

351
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:33,846
What makes you say that?

352
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,326
Well, I'm a teacher, and I know

353
00:23:35,369 --> 00:23:37,502
there are some people who use
the word "empirically"

354
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:39,939
in a conversation, and
there are very many who don't.

355
00:23:39,983 --> 00:23:41,395
And the clever ones are
those that do.

356
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,768
Did I use it?

357
00:23:42,812 --> 00:23:44,790
Yes. Nigel la. "Empirically
sexy". And "reductive".

358
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:46,685
Oh, yes, you're right. So I did.

359
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,907
So, what, you don't think this is
a job for clever people, is that it?

360
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,778
No! No, no,
I didn't mean that. No.

361
00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:55,694
No, I was just asking about
qualifications and...

362
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,435
Did you go to school?

363
00:23:59,263 --> 00:24:02,745
Of course. I mean, my mother was
a very strict Irish Catholic.

364
00:24:04,224 --> 00:24:06,575
And what does she think about
what you're doing now?

365
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:09,752
You want to talk
about my mother? Really?

366
00:24:10,143 --> 00:24:12,581
Well, you brought her up.
- Well now I'm dropping it.

367
00:24:14,234 --> 00:24:15,234
But seriously...

368
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,109
She doesn't know.

369
00:24:20,763 --> 00:24:23,026
You know, this
looks so sexy on you.

370
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:24,462
What does she think you do?

371
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:26,464
If I tell you, can we drop it?

372
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:28,684
Because you really
do look good in this.

373
00:24:28,727 --> 00:24:30,120
I promise.

374
00:24:33,384 --> 00:24:36,039
She thinks I work on an oil rig.

375
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,434
An oil rig?

376
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:42,045
Yes, an oil rig.
In the North Sea.

377
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:48,138
No, but... But do...

378
00:24:48,181 --> 00:24:50,619
Do you keep in contact?
Do you send her updates

379
00:24:50,662 --> 00:24:53,056
about life on the oil rig?
- Now, Nancy, you promised.

380
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:55,841
But how do you know what happens
on an oil rig?

381
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:57,539
I Google it, you know.

382
00:24:57,582 --> 00:25:00,150
I found a website where there's
stories about life on an oil rig

383
00:25:00,193 --> 00:25:01,891
and I copy and
paste them sometimes.

384
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:04,328
Ha. That's amazing. What a life.

385
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:08,724
Oh, dear. Meanwhile, my son's
doing his Masters at university.

386
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:09,942
Are you not happy about that?

387
00:25:09,986 --> 00:25:12,075
Oh, yes, no, I am,
of course I'm happy.

388
00:25:12,118 --> 00:25:13,511
It's great.

389
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,445
Why wouldn't I be happy?
It's just what's expected.

390
00:25:15,469 --> 00:25:17,515
Why do you sound
so ambivalent about it?

391
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:19,604
"Ambivalent", that's another good word.
- Mm-hmm.

392
00:25:19,648 --> 00:25:21,432
So... your son?

393
00:25:21,475 --> 00:25:23,739
Yes, well, I...
I... I... Oh dear.

394
00:25:24,478 --> 00:25:27,003
I've never said this to
anyone before, this is awful.

395
00:25:27,046 --> 00:25:29,005
It's OK, who am I going to tell?

396
00:25:29,658 --> 00:25:30,659
Come on.

397
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:33,618
I... well, the truth is
I find him boring.

398
00:25:37,187 --> 00:25:39,015
You find your own son boring?

399
00:25:39,058 --> 00:25:40,625
Yes. That's awful, isn't it?

400
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:42,845
I've just never heard anyone
say that before.

401
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,935
Have you always
found him boring?

402
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:48,764
No, not always.
No, he's a very nice boy.

403
00:25:48,807 --> 00:25:51,680
He's just very predictable,
like his father.

404
00:25:51,723 --> 00:25:52,855
What's he studying?

405
00:25:52,898 --> 00:25:54,639
Chemistry. Please
forget I said that.

406
00:25:54,683 --> 00:25:57,860
Just forget it, he's a lovely
boy and I love him very much

407
00:25:57,903 --> 00:26:00,645
and I should be grateful because
he's turned out very well.

408
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:01,820
Any other kids?

409
00:26:01,864 --> 00:26:03,953
Mm. Daughter. Older.
We don't get along.

410
00:26:04,431 --> 00:26:05,563
Oh, why not?

411
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:06,608
She thinks I'm cold.

412
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,479
And what do you think?

413
00:26:08,522 --> 00:26:09,741
I don't think I'm cold.

414
00:26:10,394 --> 00:26:12,396
I mean, I don't feel cold inside

415
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:17,619
but maybe I'm cold with her because
she's so over the top all the time.

416
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,143
So the opposite to her brother.

417
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:24,103
She lives in Barcelona,
in this bohemian set-up.

418
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:26,802
They're all artists, although
I've never seen any actual art.

419
00:26:26,845 --> 00:26:29,935
Unless the art consists of burning
your parents' money, which...

420
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:31,850
Actually, it's not
out of the question.

421
00:26:32,677 --> 00:26:33,939
At least she's not boring.

422
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:35,941
No, no, there is
that. There is that.

423
00:26:38,074 --> 00:26:41,730
So your children have
disappointed you, Nancy.

424
00:26:41,773 --> 00:26:45,255
Yes. But when did
you last see your mum?

425
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:47,823
Why?

426
00:26:47,866 --> 00:26:50,434
Cos I'm interested in
where you come from.

427
00:26:51,174 --> 00:26:52,566
I don't come from anywhere.

428
00:26:53,524 --> 00:26:57,006
You know, I was actually found
under a little patch of mushrooms

429
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:59,791
size of a bean,
raised by friendly wolves.

430
00:27:07,538 --> 00:27:09,105
Oh, go on. Tell me something.

431
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:12,717
I'm in awe of
anyone who becomes a mother.

432
00:27:14,197 --> 00:27:15,720
Hardest job in the world.

433
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:18,680
Did you get that off Mumsnet
or something?

434
00:27:18,723 --> 00:27:20,029
Sorry?

435
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:22,292
It's a bit general.
Not all mothers are good.

436
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,644
Well, I wouldn't know.
I've only had one.

437
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:28,907
Yeah, we're all stuck with
whatever we get, aren't we?

438
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:30,430
Parents and children alike.

439
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,998
At least I know what mine
are up to, though.

440
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:35,827
Haven't you ever wondered if
your son is lying to you about his life?

441
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,916
No.
- Why not?

442
00:27:39,265 --> 00:27:41,180
Maybe he doesn't
want to disappoint you.

443
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:02,071
Has he got a partner?

444
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:04,203
Yes. Nice girl, also boring.

445
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:07,250
Training to be a primary school
teacher. Boring, boring, boring.

446
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:09,774
I thought you said you were
a schoolteacher?

447
00:28:09,818 --> 00:28:11,534
Yeah, but I was
a Religious Education teacher

448
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:13,839
in a secondary school. That's
a very different beast to...

449
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,780
colouring in with six-year-olds.

450
00:28:15,824 --> 00:28:18,087
They say primary education
is the most important.

451
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,741
Well, they're wrong.

452
00:28:20,872 --> 00:28:23,285
Do you know what proportion of
secondary school students think

453
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:26,071
that Religious Education is worth even
an ounce of their time and attention?

454
00:28:26,095 --> 00:28:27,487
I mean, I...
- No, well, exactly.

455
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:29,707
Exactly. So there I would be,
year after year

456
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:32,797
spouting the same old stuff, unable
to break away from the curriculum

457
00:28:32,841 --> 00:28:35,278
in case I got complaints from
the head and unable to ask them

458
00:28:35,321 --> 00:28:37,715
anything real
in case we lost time

459
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,151
and just
battling through the work

460
00:28:39,195 --> 00:28:40,979
and getting
them through the exams

461
00:28:41,023 --> 00:28:42,740
and then you just start again
the following year

462
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:44,766
doing the same old stuff.
It was just stultifying.

463
00:28:48,987 --> 00:28:50,684
I think I may
have killed the mood.

464
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:52,338
I'm not sure there was a mood.

465
00:28:53,122 --> 00:28:55,428
I'm sorry, that was rude of me.
- No, it's true.

466
00:28:55,472 --> 00:28:57,648
No, but you're not paying
for the truth, though.

467
00:28:58,127 --> 00:28:59,476
You're paying for a fantasy.

468
00:28:59,911 --> 00:29:02,087
At this moment, I'm not
sure what I'm paying for.

469
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:08,964
I can show you.

470
00:29:10,617 --> 00:29:11,793
I don't doubt it.

471
00:29:14,012 --> 00:29:15,840
What would get
you back in the mood?

472
00:29:15,884 --> 00:29:17,320
Hmm?

473
00:29:17,363 --> 00:29:19,583
What would your husband do
to get it all going again?

474
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:24,327
Um...

475
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,415
Well...

476
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:28,418
He... He would, er...

477
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:32,770
take all his clothes off,
and lie in the bed

478
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,599
without putting his pyjamas on.

479
00:29:36,034 --> 00:29:37,775
And I would take
all my clothes off

480
00:29:38,254 --> 00:29:39,342
put my nightie on

481
00:29:39,385 --> 00:29:40,865
and lie in the bed next to him

482
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:43,912
and then he would rub my
shoulders and breasts a bit

483
00:29:43,955 --> 00:29:46,131
and then he would climb on top,
do the business

484
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:48,090
kiss my cheek, roll off,
put his pyjamas on

485
00:29:48,133 --> 00:29:49,352
and go back to sleep.

486
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:52,181
That's it?
- That's it.

487
00:29:52,746 --> 00:29:53,922
Always?
- Always.

488
00:29:53,965 --> 00:29:56,054
No deviation for 31 years.

489
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:59,101
And that's the
only sex you've ever had?

490
00:29:59,144 --> 00:30:00,406
Correct.

491
00:30:02,756 --> 00:30:03,801
Wow.

492
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:06,630
"Wow" indeed.

493
00:30:07,979 --> 00:30:09,285
No oral?

494
00:30:09,328 --> 00:30:10,939
No oral.
- Not even on him?

495
00:30:10,982 --> 00:30:12,462
No, he said it was demeaning.

496
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:14,377
For you?
- For him.

497
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,118
OK...

498
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:19,643
OK, and I presume it was
the same for him on you?

499
00:30:20,122 --> 00:30:22,298
Yes, he said that was demeaning
for him too.

500
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:26,606
So, you've never had...

501
00:30:28,086 --> 00:30:29,958
No, I've never had.

502
00:30:31,046 --> 00:30:32,134
Never given.

503
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:35,224
Do you want to?

504
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:36,486
Yes, I do. I want to.

505
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:38,401
I want to very much.

506
00:30:38,444 --> 00:30:39,793
I always have done.

507
00:30:41,404 --> 00:30:42,535
Sorry.

508
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:43,928
I'm sorry to cry.

509
00:30:43,972 --> 00:30:45,364
It's stupid.

510
00:30:47,453 --> 00:30:48,498
I, um...

511
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:51,936
I think that...

512
00:30:56,985 --> 00:30:59,770
Well, when I was a... a teenager

513
00:30:59,813 --> 00:31:03,556
my parents took me
to Greece on holiday

514
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:08,387
um, it was a once-in-a-lifetime
trip, for them, anyway, and...

515
00:31:09,127 --> 00:31:10,127
um...

516
00:31:11,042 --> 00:31:14,176
at the hotel there was this
waiter, I think he was about 20

517
00:31:15,351 --> 00:31:20,269
and he looked at me like I was...
the most delicious thing he'd ever seen

518
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:23,707
and I felt my body go to water.

519
00:31:24,577 --> 00:31:28,494
And one night, he was
hanging around after his shift

520
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:30,366
and um, I was hot

521
00:31:31,236 --> 00:31:35,632
so I went out into the garden
after my parents had gone to bed

522
00:31:35,675 --> 00:31:38,461
and he was there,
smoking a cigarette

523
00:31:38,504 --> 00:31:43,422
and, um... I stood

524
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:49,211
in front of this little bush
covered in tiny pink flowers

525
00:31:49,254 --> 00:31:50,429
looking out to sea...

526
00:31:52,518 --> 00:31:55,217
and without a
word, he came up and...

527
00:31:56,609 --> 00:31:57,959
...kissed my neck

528
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:02,224
and put his hand under my skirt
and into my knickers

529
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,793
and I could feel him
sliding around down there

530
00:32:06,837 --> 00:32:09,013
and I was pushing
myself back into him

531
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:13,104
and it was the most crazy,
exciting feeling I'd ever had

532
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:16,238
and... and, um,
then a car started up

533
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,545
and the headlamps came on

534
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:21,547
and he was startled
so he dashed away.

535
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:25,247
And the next day we went home.

536
00:32:26,117 --> 00:32:28,293
And I wished we'd just stayed
one more day.

537
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,957
Hello.
- Hello again.

538
00:33:27,222 --> 00:33:28,222
Thank you.

539
00:33:28,962 --> 00:33:31,052
This is a very nice surprise.

540
00:33:31,574 --> 00:33:32,966
Is it?

541
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,640
It's the same room.
I mean, I booked the same room

542
00:33:34,664 --> 00:33:36,927
cos I didn't want to
be thrown by a new layout.

543
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,016
Oh, no, I mean
you booking me again.

544
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,931
Oh.
- I mean, you must've been satisfied

545
00:33:40,974 --> 00:33:42,933
the last time, so
I'm happy about that.

546
00:33:42,976 --> 00:33:45,022
Yes, yes, I was satisfied. Yes.

547
00:33:46,154 --> 00:33:47,416
But?

548
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:48,852
But?

549
00:33:48,895 --> 00:33:51,202
Oh, it sounded like there was
going to be a "but".

550
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:53,291
No, no, not particularly.

551
00:33:53,335 --> 00:33:55,728
I, um, I've got a little bit
of feedback

552
00:33:55,772 --> 00:33:57,948
and a couple of attainment goals
for this time.

553
00:33:57,991 --> 00:33:59,863
Right, I see. Sure. OK.

554
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:01,995
Would you like a drink?
- Yeah.

555
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,258
That sounds great.

556
00:34:10,787 --> 00:34:12,180
Cheers.

557
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:18,099
So, I've made a list of things
that I'd like to get through.

558
00:34:18,142 --> 00:34:19,970
Oh, that sounds sexy.

559
00:34:20,013 --> 00:34:22,015
Don't mock me. I'm a teacher.

560
00:34:22,755 --> 00:34:24,105
Old habits die hard.

561
00:34:24,148 --> 00:34:25,454
What's first on the list?

562
00:34:30,763 --> 00:34:32,374
Number one:

563
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:34,506
I perform oral sex on you.

564
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:37,292
Number two: you
perform oral sex on me.

565
00:34:37,335 --> 00:34:39,642
Number three: we do a "69"

566
00:34:39,685 --> 00:34:41,339
if that's what
it's still called.

567
00:34:41,383 --> 00:34:42,514
Uh, I don't know.

568
00:34:42,558 --> 00:34:45,735
Um, four: me on top.
- Doggy-style.

569
00:34:47,606 --> 00:34:49,956
Well, that all
sounds very achievable.

570
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,349
Oh, does it? Oh, good.

571
00:34:51,871 --> 00:34:55,571
Good, cos I'm...
I have no frame of reference.

572
00:34:56,093 --> 00:34:59,314
I've tried, um, looking on the
internet, but it's alarming, frankly.

573
00:34:59,357 --> 00:35:01,490
I mean, if you type
in "classy porn" to Google

574
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,448
up pop 12 windows of erections.

575
00:35:03,492 --> 00:35:06,103
I mean, there's no build-up at
all. Have I booked enough time?

576
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,410
You want to do it all today?

577
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:10,020
Yes, if possible.

578
00:35:10,063 --> 00:35:12,153
I mean, it's just,
you're quite expensive

579
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:15,243
and I'm not sure if I'll be able to
afford another session after this.

580
00:35:15,634 --> 00:35:16,940
OK.

581
00:35:16,983 --> 00:35:18,289
OK.

582
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:19,856
I understand, um...

583
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,947
Isn't there something else
that should be on that list?

584
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,428
Like what?

585
00:35:26,471 --> 00:35:29,431
Well, I'd love for you to feel
completely satisfied...

586
00:35:29,474 --> 00:35:30,606
if at all possible.

587
00:35:32,347 --> 00:35:33,522
Oh.

588
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:34,871
Oh.

589
00:35:34,914 --> 00:35:36,612
The big "o", in fact.

590
00:35:36,655 --> 00:35:38,004
Yes.

591
00:35:38,048 --> 00:35:41,486
No, I like a list that can be
fully ticked-off.

592
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:44,272
Achievable goals.
That's the path to happiness,

593
00:35:44,315 --> 00:35:45,858
there's no point in wishing for
the moon.

594
00:35:45,882 --> 00:35:48,232
Well, it's an orgasm, you know,
it's not a Fabergé egg.

595
00:35:48,276 --> 00:35:49,755
People have them every day.

596
00:35:52,105 --> 00:35:55,413
Right. Do you know what, you're
right. That all makes sense.

597
00:35:55,935 --> 00:35:58,155
I just... I want to feel
a sense of achievement.

598
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,983
Yes.
- I don't want to walk away...

599
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:02,072
from this feeling unresolved.

600
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:05,206
May I?

601
00:36:07,773 --> 00:36:08,905
Do you know what?

602
00:36:08,948 --> 00:36:10,994
We'll do as much of this
as we can today.

603
00:36:11,037 --> 00:36:13,562
I think we'll certainly make
a significant dent in it.

604
00:36:14,302 --> 00:36:15,259
Good.

605
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:16,652
That's good. Good.

606
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:19,089
You want to
start with the blow job?

607
00:36:20,438 --> 00:36:21,744
Yes, I think so.

608
00:36:22,484 --> 00:36:23,833
Get the big one
out the way first.

609
00:36:27,315 --> 00:36:28,490
Should I kneel?

610
00:36:29,317 --> 00:36:32,494
Well, I could stand on a chair,
but that's not how it's usually done.

611
00:36:33,843 --> 00:36:35,018
Mm-hmm.

612
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:38,021
You don't have
to do any of this.

613
00:36:38,064 --> 00:36:41,154
No, I know, I... but I want
to be a woman of the world.

614
00:36:41,198 --> 00:36:44,114
I mean, there are nuns out there
with more sexual experience than me.

615
00:36:44,157 --> 00:36:46,092
It's embarrassing. Do
you want me to brush my teeth?

616
00:36:46,116 --> 00:36:50,381
What? No. Nancy, you can just...
you can just let go.

617
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,992
Let go? What am
I letting go of, exactly?

618
00:36:53,036 --> 00:36:54,951
I mean, we need some
sort of plan, don't we?

619
00:36:54,994 --> 00:36:57,451
I don't want to swing from the
chandeliers and make loud animal noises.

620
00:36:57,475 --> 00:36:58,694
I'd like to see that.

621
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:03,002
You're letting go of the
thing inside that grips you.

622
00:37:03,046 --> 00:37:04,308
You know, that judges you.

623
00:37:04,352 --> 00:37:06,267
That watches
you from the outside.

624
00:37:06,832 --> 00:37:08,878
Christ, if I let go of that,
anything might happen.

625
00:37:08,921 --> 00:37:10,551
That's the only thing keeping
my life together.

626
00:37:10,575 --> 00:37:12,490
Keeping it
ticking along... Here?

627
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:13,752
Over here.

628
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:15,711
What am I just supposed to do?

629
00:37:15,754 --> 00:37:17,863
Just float around like
some sort of free form jellyfish

630
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:19,430
you know, waiting for something
to come up?

631
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:21,194
No, but you're...
- Do I undo your belt?

632
00:37:21,238 --> 00:37:22,587
Do you undo it?
What's normal?

633
00:37:22,631 --> 00:37:24,304
Well, it's more a matter of...
- Well, I'll do it.

634
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:25,590
OK.

635
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:27,636
No, I just... I just want
to do a blow job.

636
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:30,484
I want to get that sorted and then we
can work through as much of the rest

637
00:37:30,508 --> 00:37:33,182
of the list as we can in the allotted time.
- Like we've got a double lesson

638
00:37:33,206 --> 00:37:36,688
timetabled for oral, and then we
can see what's left of the afternoon?

639
00:37:36,732 --> 00:37:38,342
Exactly.
- And shall I ring a bell

640
00:37:38,386 --> 00:37:39,735
at the end of the session?

641
00:37:39,778 --> 00:37:41,338
Do you use a bell?
You didn't last time.

642
00:37:43,086 --> 00:37:44,087
Oh.

643
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:46,785
Very funny.

644
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:55,577
Um...

645
00:37:56,447 --> 00:37:57,448
Oh...

646
00:37:57,492 --> 00:37:58,623
Sorry.

647
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:00,973
I'll be back to all this
in just a second.

648
00:38:04,586 --> 00:38:06,239
Hi, darling. Hi.

649
00:38:51,937 --> 00:38:53,591
Sorry about that.
- Everything OK?

650
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:58,030
Yes. My daughter. She's just in a bit
of a pickle at the moment, shall we say.

651
00:38:58,074 --> 00:38:59,423
I'm sorry to hear that.

652
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:01,425
Well, it's not the first time,
won't be the last.

653
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:03,862
She used to ring her father
about all this, but anyway...

654
00:39:03,906 --> 00:39:06,735
Um, shall we just try
and get through what we can?

655
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,346
Before the exam?
- Um, yes.

656
00:39:09,955 --> 00:39:11,087
Nancy.

657
00:39:16,527 --> 00:39:19,400
There is no exam.
It's all a dance.

658
00:39:19,922 --> 00:39:21,314
I don't know the steps.

659
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:24,056
An improvised dance,
we just go where it takes us.

660
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,363
There's no timetable,
there's no bell.

661
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:28,017
But I've only
paid for two hours.

662
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,411
Well, then let's enjoy them.
Every single minute.

663
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:32,543
OK, come on then.

664
00:39:32,587 --> 00:39:35,633
Do you want to start with the blow job
or go with something else on the list?

665
00:39:35,677 --> 00:39:37,679
No, I think I'd like
to go in order.

666
00:39:37,722 --> 00:39:39,942
I feel like I'm prepared
for the blow job now.

667
00:39:39,985 --> 00:39:43,946
Robert, my husband, he never...
he never wanted to try anything new.

668
00:39:44,729 --> 00:39:47,776
He planned everything, I mean,
even his own funeral, actually.

669
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:49,734
I was terrified
he'd turn up on the day

670
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:52,302
and tell me I'd put the
wrong ham in the sandwiches.

671
00:39:53,651 --> 00:39:54,913
It wasn't a...

672
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:58,700
furnace of
passion that burnt out

673
00:39:58,743 --> 00:40:01,137
our relationship,
it was more like, um...

674
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,792
the bottom drawer of an AGA.

675
00:40:03,835 --> 00:40:05,010
A what?

676
00:40:05,054 --> 00:40:08,753
Um, it's an old-fashioned stove.

677
00:40:08,797 --> 00:40:11,016
You can't turn it off.

678
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,236
It keeps on chugging away,
and at the bottom

679
00:40:13,279 --> 00:40:15,107
there's a kind of
cooler drawer thing

680
00:40:15,151 --> 00:40:17,022
that you can push things
to the back of...

681
00:40:17,066 --> 00:40:18,807
Mm.
- ...you know, to cook them slowly

682
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:21,287
like a bowl of stewed apples
or something.

683
00:40:21,331 --> 00:40:22,637
I see.
- Do you?

684
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,160
Er, not really.

685
00:40:24,203 --> 00:40:27,424
But, um, I think you mean
your marriage stewed slowly

686
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:29,208
because you
pushed it to the back.

687
00:40:29,252 --> 00:40:30,427
And then forgot about it.

688
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,777
Mm.
- Mm.

689
00:40:32,821 --> 00:40:34,692
Well, anyway.
He's gone, it's all gone.

690
00:40:34,736 --> 00:40:35,867
Ancient history.

691
00:40:37,129 --> 00:40:39,567
And I want to try something new.

692
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:42,265
Then, good.

693
00:40:42,308 --> 00:40:44,789
So, I need to get that blow job
under my belt.

694
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:46,225
Your belt, obviously.

695
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:47,357
OK.

696
00:40:51,187 --> 00:40:52,231
OK?

697
00:40:53,755 --> 00:40:55,670
OK, OK, look.

698
00:40:55,713 --> 00:40:58,107
I have an idea.

699
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,065
You like dancing, right?

700
00:41:00,805 --> 00:41:02,285
Only when nobody's watching.

701
00:41:02,328 --> 00:41:04,679
OK, well then we're gonna
change the mood.

702
00:41:04,722 --> 00:41:06,594
I'm gonna put on some music

703
00:41:07,029 --> 00:41:09,901
and you're gonna dance
like nobody is watching.

704
00:41:27,266 --> 00:41:29,225
Come on, Nancy Stokes.

705
00:41:29,268 --> 00:41:30,748
Come have a dance with me.

706
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:25,646
Oh, shit.

707
00:43:26,908 --> 00:43:28,213
Oh, God, God.

708
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:30,999
That'll be my daughter again.

709
00:43:31,782 --> 00:43:33,131
She always rings twice.

710
00:43:33,915 --> 00:43:37,048
She always forgets the most crucial
bit of information and has to ring back.

711
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,355
OK.
- I don't want to answer it.

712
00:43:39,398 --> 00:43:41,313
Then don't.
- But I always answer it.

713
00:43:41,357 --> 00:43:42,750
Even when you don't want to?

714
00:43:42,793 --> 00:43:44,708
Yeah, especially when I don't want to.
- OK.

715
00:43:44,752 --> 00:43:46,841
Well, what am I gonna say?

716
00:43:46,884 --> 00:43:49,210
"Hello darling, I'm sorry I can't talk
now cos I've booked this man for the night

717
00:43:49,234 --> 00:43:52,150
and I'm trying to work up the
courage to perform oral sex on him".

718
00:43:52,194 --> 00:43:54,370
Well, you don't
have to say that.

719
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:56,285
Shall I answer it?

720
00:43:56,328 --> 00:43:58,069
"Hello, darling.

721
00:43:58,113 --> 00:44:00,178
I'm sorry but your mother has
something in her mouth right now."

722
00:44:00,202 --> 00:44:01,551
Shh!
- "I could take your message

723
00:44:01,594 --> 00:44:02,683
if you would like."

724
00:44:05,598 --> 00:44:07,252
Listen, darling, I...

725
00:44:10,647 --> 00:44:13,519
Yes. Oh, did he? Oh, God. Yes.

726
00:44:15,043 --> 00:44:16,305
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

727
00:44:17,654 --> 00:44:19,787
Oh, I am so sorry,
yes, I do understand.

728
00:44:21,614 --> 00:44:22,659
Mm-hmm.

729
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:24,835
Yeah.

730
00:44:27,229 --> 00:44:29,840
Listen, darling, I really do...

731
00:44:29,884 --> 00:44:30,884
Pamela?

732
00:44:31,929 --> 00:44:33,278
Pamela?

733
00:44:33,322 --> 00:44:34,366
Oh, she's gone.

734
00:44:35,019 --> 00:44:37,065
Just like that? No goodbye?

735
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:39,937
Well, either her battery ran out
or she's been abducted.

736
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:42,418
Is it serious? Her pickle?

737
00:44:42,461 --> 00:44:44,594
Well, it can be sorted,
that's the main thing.

738
00:44:44,637 --> 00:44:46,204
I see.

739
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:49,338
Matthew will provide the
grandchildren, I've no doubt of that.

740
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:52,645
If Pamela can just keep
herself alive, I'll be happy.

741
00:44:53,472 --> 00:44:55,126
You don't sound very happy.

742
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:57,912
Well, it's very stressful being
a parent, Leo.

743
00:44:57,955 --> 00:44:59,783
It's a stress
that never leaves you

744
00:44:59,827 --> 00:45:01,611
it's... it's like
a thumb on a bruise.

745
00:45:01,654 --> 00:45:04,701
Sometimes my children feel like
a dead weight around my neck.

746
00:45:05,484 --> 00:45:07,748
I'm not sure I'd have done it
if I'd known.

747
00:45:08,313 --> 00:45:09,401
What do you mean?

748
00:45:10,663 --> 00:45:13,449
I mean, I could've done many
other things, if I hadn't been a mother.

749
00:45:14,624 --> 00:45:16,931
What else would you have done?
- I dunno.

750
00:45:17,845 --> 00:45:19,194
Crossed the desert on a horse...

751
00:45:19,672 --> 00:45:22,937
started an artists' colony
on a hot little island...

752
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,547
had a... had an orgasm...

753
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:29,857
Would you find a massage
patronising at this point?

754
00:45:30,814 --> 00:45:33,904
No. No, I wouldn't.

755
00:45:46,699 --> 00:45:48,484
Do you think your
kids could feel it?

756
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:51,487
Your disappointment in them?

757
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:55,317
I don't know Leo. I doubt it.

758
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:57,928
They mostly
didn't notice me, I think.

759
00:45:59,016 --> 00:46:01,889
I mean, do you notice
when your mother's disappointed?

760
00:46:05,457 --> 00:46:08,721
Are you worried that she'd be
disappointed if she knew what you do?

761
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:11,724
I'm not sure what you mean.

762
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:13,988
There's nothing disappointing
about an oil rig, ma'am.

763
00:46:16,729 --> 00:46:18,427
Anyway, there's
still time for you.

764
00:46:19,428 --> 00:46:21,430
Oh, that's
sweet, but there isn't.

765
00:46:22,387 --> 00:46:23,780
This is it.

766
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,696
My final attempt at a life.

767
00:46:27,566 --> 00:46:29,351
For the orgasm, I mean.

768
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:32,702
You might have to abandon riding
a horse across the desert.

769
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:55,246
Can I ask you to
do something for me?

770
00:46:55,768 --> 00:46:56,857
Mm-hmm.

771
00:46:59,337 --> 00:47:02,079
Would you mind
taking your shirt off?

772
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,865
Sure. OK.

773
00:47:29,454 --> 00:47:30,891
Can I touch you, for a moment?

774
00:47:34,807 --> 00:47:35,852
You're just so...

775
00:47:40,465 --> 00:47:41,684
I never thought I...

776
00:47:48,996 --> 00:47:50,693
Can I touch your shoulders?

777
00:47:51,302 --> 00:47:52,347
Yes.

778
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:16,414
And your arms?

779
00:48:17,328 --> 00:48:18,373
Yes.

780
00:48:33,823 --> 00:48:34,998
And your chest?

781
00:48:36,043 --> 00:48:37,044
Yes.

782
00:48:52,624 --> 00:48:55,018
Oh. Put that back on then.

783
00:48:55,671 --> 00:48:57,281
You want me to put it back on?

784
00:48:57,934 --> 00:48:59,675
Yes, if you want to.

785
00:48:59,718 --> 00:49:01,938
I thought things were
progressing quite nicely.

786
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:03,331
I was suddenly overwhelmed.

787
00:49:03,896 --> 00:49:04,941
By what?

788
00:49:05,724 --> 00:49:08,162
Some wave, something of...

789
00:49:08,205 --> 00:49:09,554
Lust.

790
00:49:09,598 --> 00:49:12,427
Maybe. Sorry, I just feel
a bit sick, actually.

791
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:14,274
Tiny bit faint.
- Put your head between your legs.

792
00:49:14,298 --> 00:49:15,734
I can do that on my own time.

793
00:49:15,778 --> 00:49:18,650
I'll just, just, um... maybe
step away for a moment.

794
00:49:19,129 --> 00:49:20,478
Catch my breath.

795
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:22,741
Have a drink.

796
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:34,318
It's just, I, er... I've never
felt anyone like you before.

797
00:49:35,102 --> 00:49:37,974
Like me?
- Yeah, muscular, fit. Like a model.

798
00:49:38,627 --> 00:49:39,802
I work out.

799
00:49:40,281 --> 00:49:42,848
I'm sure you do.
- I work hard.

800
00:49:43,501 --> 00:49:45,590
Don't you ever feel sometimes
it's a bit shallow?

801
00:49:48,376 --> 00:49:50,900
Yes. But my
clients like it, you know.

802
00:49:50,943 --> 00:49:52,597
And I like being wanted by them.

803
00:49:54,164 --> 00:49:57,689
When I'm here with you, being
looked at by you, I feel good.

804
00:49:57,733 --> 00:49:59,648
God, I can barely imagine that.

805
00:50:03,956 --> 00:50:05,436
Come here and stand with me.

806
00:50:25,804 --> 00:50:30,026
I've always been ashamed
of myself. My body, I mean.

807
00:50:30,592 --> 00:50:31,941
Always?
- Mm.

808
00:50:31,984 --> 00:50:33,856
Always been aware of
what's wrong with it.

809
00:50:34,378 --> 00:50:36,815
You know, stubby
thighs, fat tummy...

810
00:50:38,817 --> 00:50:41,298
boobs come down to my naval now,
my arms wobble...

811
00:50:41,342 --> 00:50:43,300
they have done
since I was 20, actually...

812
00:50:43,996 --> 00:50:46,129
and if I didn't pluck here
and here

813
00:50:46,869 --> 00:50:48,697
I could join a
circus after a month.

814
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:51,656
Oh, I've plucked it.
- Mm.

815
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,182
Don't be fooled
by the muscles, Nancy.

816
00:50:56,008 --> 00:50:57,793
I sometimes feel ashamed too.

817
00:50:57,836 --> 00:50:59,055
That's hard to imagine.

818
00:50:59,969 --> 00:51:01,449
Well, if I didn't look like this

819
00:51:01,492 --> 00:51:03,712
you might not have chosen me,
or wanted me.

820
00:51:08,325 --> 00:51:09,544
Can I unbutton this?

821
00:51:09,935 --> 00:51:11,023
Yes.

822
00:51:20,772 --> 00:51:22,339
Can I take this off?
- Mm-hmm.

823
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:44,187
Your body is beautiful.

824
00:51:44,753 --> 00:51:46,058
I wish you could see that.

825
00:51:52,717 --> 00:51:54,632
I have always
quite liked my calves.

826
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,027
They're not completely awful.

827
00:51:59,507 --> 00:52:00,899
I can hear my mother...

828
00:52:00,943 --> 00:52:02,379
"Vanity is a weakness, dear."

829
00:52:02,423 --> 00:52:04,076
It's not vain
to enjoy your body.

830
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,165
To love it.

831
00:52:06,035 --> 00:52:08,777
But I know that voice in your
head, the one that talks shit at you.

832
00:52:09,256 --> 00:52:10,387
I have one too.

833
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:12,389
It gets tiring...

834
00:52:13,912 --> 00:52:15,131
so boring.

835
00:52:16,001 --> 00:52:17,438
Oh, I'm sorry to bore you.

836
00:52:17,481 --> 00:52:19,614
You're not...
You're not boring me, Nancy.

837
00:52:20,919 --> 00:52:23,052
Hm... Is Leo Grande
your real name?

838
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:26,795
No.

839
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:35,412
Is Nancy Stokes your real name?

840
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:38,372
No.

841
00:52:45,422 --> 00:52:46,989
Do you know, sometimes I wonder

842
00:52:47,032 --> 00:52:49,600
whether what you young men need
is a war.

843
00:52:50,775 --> 00:52:51,820
Excuse me?

844
00:52:51,863 --> 00:52:53,648
Well, you're all
just so fit and...

845
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:57,086
bursting with energy and killing
pretend soldiers on your computers

846
00:52:57,129 --> 00:52:59,412
but actually, underneath it all,
you're really quite anxious

847
00:52:59,436 --> 00:53:01,308
and not quite
sure of yourselves.

848
00:53:01,351 --> 00:53:03,353
Perhaps that's what
every generation needs.

849
00:53:03,397 --> 00:53:06,095
A war. It's self-correcting.
It makes us all nicer.

850
00:53:06,138 --> 00:53:09,098
My generation of men, they never
had a chance to prove themselves.

851
00:53:09,141 --> 00:53:11,381
I mean, I think they felt actually
inadequate in front of their fathers.

852
00:53:11,405 --> 00:53:12,947
And I think it's caused
a whole lot of bother

853
00:53:12,971 --> 00:53:15,017
and I'm worried your
lot are gonna be even worse.

854
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,627
My brother's in the army.

855
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:19,500
Is he? Oh, sorry.
I didn't mean to imply...

856
00:53:20,718 --> 00:53:22,111
Is he older or younger?

857
00:53:22,154 --> 00:53:23,678
He's younger. He's 24.

858
00:53:24,505 --> 00:53:25,854
Huh. Which bit of the army?

859
00:53:25,897 --> 00:53:26,811
Artillery.

860
00:53:26,855 --> 00:53:28,378
Mm, oh, the big guns.

861
00:53:29,074 --> 00:53:30,946
Yeah, well,
might as well go all in.

862
00:53:30,989 --> 00:53:33,209
If I was in the army,
I'd want big guns too.

863
00:53:34,036 --> 00:53:35,777
Do you see him?
- Not much.

864
00:53:36,734 --> 00:53:38,127
Miss him?

865
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:39,346
Of course.

866
00:53:40,085 --> 00:53:41,391
I love him.

867
00:53:42,784 --> 00:53:45,134
And he doesn't...
He doesn't know about all this?

868
00:53:45,177 --> 00:53:46,177
No.

869
00:53:47,049 --> 00:53:48,050
No.

870
00:53:48,703 --> 00:53:50,357
He thinks I work at the oil rig.

871
00:53:51,053 --> 00:53:52,315
Uh-huh.

872
00:53:52,359 --> 00:53:54,317
Not sure he believes it.

873
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:56,145
So, you're not close?

874
00:53:57,842 --> 00:53:58,974
Can I top you up?

875
00:54:00,497 --> 00:54:02,151
Yes... please.

876
00:54:06,721 --> 00:54:07,852
Thank you.

877
00:54:10,899 --> 00:54:14,337
Not for me.
Or I won't enjoy myself as much.

878
00:54:29,483 --> 00:54:30,962
You wanna play a game?

879
00:54:31,615 --> 00:54:33,138
Like role play.

880
00:54:33,182 --> 00:54:35,837
We could work the blow job
into the game, it might help.

881
00:54:36,577 --> 00:54:39,144
How about teacher and student?

882
00:54:39,841 --> 00:54:41,146
We could have an RE lesson.

883
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:42,757
Like the Garden of Eden...

884
00:54:43,627 --> 00:54:44,759
the fall of man...

885
00:54:46,021 --> 00:54:47,327
Come on, Miss.

886
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:49,329
Teach me about original sin.

887
00:54:55,247 --> 00:54:57,162
You know,
I've been very bad today, Miss.

888
00:54:57,206 --> 00:54:59,687
You might have to keep me behind
after class.

889
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:02,603
You have to stop wearing
those tight skirts because I...

890
00:55:02,646 --> 00:55:04,605
I can't concentrate on my Bible.

891
00:55:04,648 --> 00:55:06,868
And, er, when you lean down
over my desk

892
00:55:06,911 --> 00:55:08,435
I can see right
down your blouse.

893
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:09,977
And last night in my bed, I...

894
00:55:10,001 --> 00:55:11,525
OK, stop it.
- But, Miss...

895
00:55:11,568 --> 00:55:13,546
No, we shouldn't be doing this.
- No, I know, Miss, but...

896
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:15,703
No, no! Safe word,
safe word, safe word.

897
00:55:15,746 --> 00:55:17,487
What?
- Safe word.

898
00:55:18,053 --> 00:55:19,446
We don't have a safe word.

899
00:55:19,489 --> 00:55:21,143
I didn't think we'd need one.

900
00:55:21,186 --> 00:55:23,406
Oh, It's OK, we can stop.
Look, I've stopped.

901
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:26,453
I'm just not into
all that, OK? My God.

902
00:55:26,496 --> 00:55:28,019
OK, sorry. I didn't mean to...

903
00:55:28,063 --> 00:55:29,673
I-I know what this looks like.

904
00:55:29,717 --> 00:55:32,415
But it's just not the point.
I don't want to dominate you.

905
00:55:32,459 --> 00:55:34,374
I don't want to teach you.
- It's only play.

906
00:55:34,417 --> 00:55:36,376
Yes, I know, but I don't want
to play at that.

907
00:55:36,419 --> 00:55:39,422
I want to play at something else. I
want to play at feeling young again.

908
00:55:40,292 --> 00:55:42,730
I want that feeling back.
That feeling of...

909
00:55:42,773 --> 00:55:44,471
having it all before me.

910
00:55:44,949 --> 00:55:46,298
You want to be 16 again?

911
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:47,952
No, I don't want to be 16 again.

912
00:55:47,996 --> 00:55:49,737
Being 16's bloody awful.

913
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,000
I want the
feeling of being 16 again.

914
00:55:52,827 --> 00:55:55,438
That power...
God, I didn't know I had it.

915
00:55:55,482 --> 00:55:56,918
It was wasted on me.

916
00:55:56,961 --> 00:55:59,616
But some
of the girls I taught...

917
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,444
they knew what they were doing.

918
00:56:01,488 --> 00:56:02,924
With the men, I mean.

919
00:56:02,967 --> 00:56:04,012
What do you mean?

920
00:56:04,578 --> 00:56:06,362
I tried to tell them, the girls

921
00:56:06,406 --> 00:56:09,365
but the skirts just kept
on going up and up and up and up

922
00:56:09,409 --> 00:56:12,760
until you could practically see
how clean their back teeth were.

923
00:56:14,022 --> 00:56:15,589
They just didn't care.

924
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:19,157
Why should they? They can wear
what they want, surely.

925
00:56:19,201 --> 00:56:22,247
Men can't always control themselves,
Leo. They're not all like you.

926
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:25,599
Some of those male teachers were
like lambs to the slaughter, poor sods.

927
00:56:25,642 --> 00:56:27,383
Or maybe they
were in the wrong job.

928
00:56:28,036 --> 00:56:32,214
Or maybe they should have realised
those girls weren't there for them.

929
00:56:36,697 --> 00:56:40,701
Have you ever been...
you know, in trouble?

930
00:56:42,572 --> 00:56:43,747
Been in trouble?

931
00:56:45,096 --> 00:56:48,143
Mm. I mean, isn't
selling sex illegal?

932
00:56:48,186 --> 00:56:51,320
No, soliciting
money for sex is illegal.

933
00:56:51,886 --> 00:56:54,062
I don't solicit
money for sex, Nancy.

934
00:56:54,802 --> 00:56:56,499
No, I sell my company.

935
00:56:57,021 --> 00:56:59,502
I provide
interesting conversation.

936
00:56:59,546 --> 00:57:03,158
I can dance, I can
make 20 different cocktails.

937
00:57:04,681 --> 00:57:07,031
Whether or not we have sex
is our business.

938
00:57:07,815 --> 00:57:09,512
There's nothing
illegal about that.

939
00:57:10,165 --> 00:57:11,645
I mean, as well as the blow jobs

940
00:57:11,688 --> 00:57:13,864
it's also quite nice
to get to know each other.

941
00:57:15,605 --> 00:57:17,477
Yes, I suppose so.

942
00:57:18,216 --> 00:57:20,654
That's why I tend to recommend
more sessions.

943
00:57:21,785 --> 00:57:23,004
Sorry?

944
00:57:23,047 --> 00:57:25,093
It makes it more
satisfying, you know?

945
00:57:25,702 --> 00:57:27,835
I'm actually looking
for more regular clients...

946
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:29,053
Oh, I see.
- What?

947
00:57:29,706 --> 00:57:31,926
I see where this is going.
- It's not "going" anywhere.

948
00:57:31,969 --> 00:57:33,623
Here it comes. The hard sell.

949
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:36,365
Is it like driving lessons?
Do I get 10 for the price of 9

950
00:57:36,408 --> 00:57:38,846
if I book in advance with
the Leo Grande School of Sex?

951
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:40,867
I don't know what other
kind of clients you have, Leo

952
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:42,110
but I am not a rich woman.

953
00:57:42,153 --> 00:57:43,764
No, I know but...
- And so, you know

954
00:57:43,807 --> 00:57:45,853
I'd like to wind up
the sales chat before my time

955
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:48,203
and money and
patience run out, so...

956
00:57:48,246 --> 00:57:51,119
please, Leo Grande,
or whatever your name is

957
00:57:51,162 --> 00:57:54,035
just give me my bloody blow job
and we can all go home.

958
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:10,442
Why don't I sit on the edge here

959
00:58:10,486 --> 00:58:12,575
and you could kneel on a cushion
in front of me?

960
00:58:12,619 --> 00:58:13,881
How about that?

961
00:58:13,924 --> 00:58:16,492
OK. If that's... optimal.

962
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,553
Do I just... get it out?

963
00:58:33,988 --> 00:58:35,163
That's right.

964
00:58:46,783 --> 00:58:49,046
Oh, it's pathetic. I'm pathetic.

965
00:58:49,481 --> 00:58:52,006
That list
was such a stupid idea.

966
00:58:52,659 --> 00:58:55,400
You know, you don't have to
do any of this. At all.

967
00:58:56,184 --> 00:58:57,925
I'm scared. That's the truth.

968
00:58:59,013 --> 00:59:00,188
Of what?

969
00:59:01,102 --> 00:59:03,757
That I won't like it.
That you won't like it.

970
00:59:05,323 --> 00:59:06,498
Maybe you won't.

971
00:59:07,238 --> 00:59:08,979
But you can try and see.

972
00:59:10,285 --> 00:59:11,329
It's no harm.

973
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,158
Unless you're gonna bite it off.

974
00:59:14,202 --> 00:59:16,465
In which case I
probably won't like it.

975
00:59:25,996 --> 00:59:28,608
Nancy, everyone
needs something different.

976
00:59:29,957 --> 00:59:31,523
Maybe you just want to talk?

977
00:59:35,136 --> 00:59:37,965
You know, I have a
regular client who just likes to

978
00:59:38,356 --> 00:59:40,445
hold hands and
watch TV together.

979
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:50,847
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I also have a client

980
00:59:50,891 --> 00:59:52,936
who likes me to walk in
without a word

981
00:59:53,415 --> 00:59:56,244
have sex with her as quickly
and silently as I can

982
00:59:56,636 --> 00:59:57,854
and then leave.

983
00:59:59,769 --> 01:00:03,468
I actually quite like that one
because it only takes ten minutes

984
01:00:03,512 --> 01:00:04,992
but she pays for the full hour.

985
01:00:08,299 --> 01:00:11,476
And there's a guy who wants me
to dress up as a cat

986
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,478
and then ignore him for an hour
and go home.

987
01:00:15,132 --> 01:00:16,830
What, and have no sex?
- No.

988
01:00:21,095 --> 01:00:24,054
I think you'd make a
very good cat, for what's worth.

989
01:00:24,925 --> 01:00:26,013
Thank you.

990
01:00:27,754 --> 01:00:30,408
What I'm trying to say is,
I don't judge my clients.

991
01:00:31,235 --> 01:00:32,410
You know?

992
01:00:32,454 --> 01:00:34,108
Unless they're total arseholes.

993
01:00:35,631 --> 01:00:37,764
And you're definitely not
a total arsehole.

994
01:00:39,548 --> 01:00:41,506
Well, that's nice to hear.

995
01:00:44,553 --> 01:00:46,250
I have a client who can't walk.

996
01:00:47,948 --> 01:00:49,079
And I bathe her.

997
01:00:50,211 --> 01:00:52,779
But what she really wants
is dirty talk while I do it.

998
01:00:54,476 --> 01:00:56,043
And then I join
her in the water.

999
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:00,351
It's what she wants.

1000
01:01:01,265 --> 01:01:03,485
Hmm.
- Everyone wants something different.

1001
01:01:03,964 --> 01:01:06,314
You sound like
some sort of sex saint.

1002
01:01:08,577 --> 01:01:09,926
Are you real?

1003
01:01:10,753 --> 01:01:13,669
Oh no, I really fancy her.

1004
01:01:14,452 --> 01:01:15,671
It's quite hot.

1005
01:01:16,628 --> 01:01:18,108
And I look forward to it.

1006
01:01:18,892 --> 01:01:20,197
It's what she needs.

1007
01:01:22,025 --> 01:01:25,072
You make it sound like it should
be available from the local council.

1008
01:01:25,115 --> 01:01:26,464
Like a public service.

1009
01:01:27,161 --> 01:01:30,251
Mm. Can you imagine how much
less bullshit there would be?

1010
01:01:30,294 --> 01:01:32,079
As long as they
don't put the rates up

1011
01:01:32,122 --> 01:01:33,950
cos people are furious enough
about that.

1012
01:01:33,994 --> 01:01:35,865
They'll still collect the bins.

1013
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,803
It's different for women, though,
in your line of work, isn't it?

1014
01:01:40,827 --> 01:01:42,524
More dangerous.
- It can be.

1015
01:01:44,047 --> 01:01:47,311
Well, I've been called some choice
names and been slapped about a bit.

1016
01:01:47,355 --> 01:01:48,617
Oh, my God.

1017
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:52,882
Oh, come on.
You know that. You do.

1018
01:01:54,971 --> 01:01:56,581
Yeah, you know

1019
01:01:56,625 --> 01:02:00,847
I used to set this exact essay
question in my ethics lessons.

1020
01:02:01,325 --> 01:02:03,066
"Should sex work be made legal?"

1021
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:06,243
And every year, 30 essays
came back, all exactly the same.

1022
01:02:06,896 --> 01:02:08,419
What did they say?

1023
01:02:08,463 --> 01:02:11,901
Uh, that although the moral
issues remain up for debate

1024
01:02:12,423 --> 01:02:15,426
the legalisation of sex work
would ultimately provide protection

1025
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:19,169
for sex workers and help
eradicate trafficking and abuse.

1026
01:02:20,214 --> 01:02:21,737
Sounds like Wikipedia.

1027
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:24,218
It is Wikipedia. They all
copied it out, word for word.

1028
01:02:24,261 --> 01:02:26,611
Every year. Except this one boy

1029
01:02:26,655 --> 01:02:28,091
Lucas White

1030
01:02:28,135 --> 01:02:29,701
who wrote, um...

1031
01:02:29,745 --> 01:02:31,399
"Sex work should be made legal

1032
01:02:31,442 --> 01:02:33,357
so your mum pays
tax on her earnings."

1033
01:02:33,401 --> 01:02:35,272
Which did provide
a bit of light relief

1034
01:02:35,316 --> 01:02:36,796
if I'm honest.

1035
01:02:37,318 --> 01:02:38,319
Oh...

1036
01:02:41,626 --> 01:02:42,802
I think it's...

1037
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:46,196
much bigger than that,
the whole idea.

1038
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:49,634
Just think how civilised
it could be

1039
01:02:50,548 --> 01:02:52,202
if it was just available to all

1040
01:02:52,246 --> 01:02:54,509
there's no shame attached,
there's no judgement.

1041
01:02:57,077 --> 01:03:01,342
You want sex, and you're frustrated
you can't get it for whatever reason.

1042
01:03:01,385 --> 01:03:04,475
You're shy, you're unwell,
you're grieving

1043
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:07,609
you're physically struggling...
so you just hire someone

1044
01:03:08,218 --> 01:03:09,350
like me.

1045
01:03:10,394 --> 01:03:12,483
It's all regulated and safe.

1046
01:03:12,527 --> 01:03:15,356
For you, for me,
better for everyone.

1047
01:03:17,314 --> 01:03:18,620
And I help you...

1048
01:03:20,491 --> 01:03:21,753
Or I pleasure you.

1049
01:03:22,754 --> 01:03:23,930
Even better.

1050
01:03:26,367 --> 01:03:29,718
The... thing is, lots of people
like the secrecy.

1051
01:03:30,284 --> 01:03:33,635
They get off on it,
or they just want the fantasy.

1052
01:03:34,288 --> 01:03:35,985
And that's totally fine

1053
01:03:36,029 --> 01:03:40,120
but... I quite like the reality

1054
01:03:41,164 --> 01:03:43,471
and it's my actual job, so...

1055
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:50,217
You know, one thing I love, Nancy,
is just to watch someone's face

1056
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:51,609
when they feel pleasure.

1057
01:03:52,784 --> 01:03:56,397
When they let go,
when they succumb

1058
01:03:56,963 --> 01:03:59,574
when the body goes with it

1059
01:03:59,617 --> 01:04:02,577
and that heat,
and that feeling...

1060
01:04:05,797 --> 01:04:08,148
Everything just loosens.

1061
01:04:10,367 --> 01:04:11,499
It's...

1062
01:04:13,849 --> 01:04:16,156
It's just so, so great.

1063
01:04:20,203 --> 01:04:21,204
Mm.

1064
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:25,860
Oh!

1065
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:30,170
You do like it.

1066
01:04:33,651 --> 01:04:37,177
Thank you for
telling me that, Leo.

1067
01:04:38,004 --> 01:04:40,789
I mean, not only because
it was very interesting

1068
01:04:41,268 --> 01:04:42,704
and enlightening...

1069
01:04:46,316 --> 01:04:47,796
But also...

1070
01:04:48,536 --> 01:04:49,711
do you mind if...

1071
01:04:51,017 --> 01:04:52,061
Go for it.

1072
01:05:28,968 --> 01:05:30,012
Mm.

1073
01:05:34,103 --> 01:05:35,103
Mm!

1074
01:05:37,193 --> 01:05:38,281
[SHE SIGHS

1075
01:05:39,021 --> 01:05:40,762
That was a surprise.

1076
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,113
A good surprise?

1077
01:05:44,157 --> 01:05:47,029
Yes, very good.
I wasn't sure about it.

1078
01:05:47,073 --> 01:05:49,118
You know, whether I'd like it,
but it's...

1079
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:51,381
like bathing in a warm sea.

1080
01:05:51,816 --> 01:05:54,167
I may have dropped off
for a moment, actually. Sorry.

1081
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:55,777
It's no problem.

1082
01:05:56,604 --> 01:06:00,477
But also no...
- No, no orgasm, no.

1083
01:06:03,132 --> 01:06:05,004
I wonder what noise I'd make.

1084
01:06:06,396 --> 01:06:09,747
Apparently
sneezing's a very good sign

1085
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:12,098
of how loud
a person is when they orgasm.

1086
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:13,664
Really?
- Yeah.

1087
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:16,058
My mother sneezes very loudly.

1088
01:06:16,102 --> 01:06:17,712
But some people sneeze
like cats.

1089
01:06:17,755 --> 01:06:19,322
You know...

1090
01:06:19,366 --> 01:06:22,891
I... I can never rid myself
of the notion

1091
01:06:22,934 --> 01:06:25,198
that they must orgasm
like cats too.

1092
01:06:25,241 --> 01:06:26,851
If cats orgasm.
I don't know, do they?

1093
01:06:26,895 --> 01:06:27,939
Nobody knows.

1094
01:06:29,332 --> 01:06:33,380
How did you fake it, with your
husband? What noise did you make?

1095
01:06:33,423 --> 01:06:34,685
Um, oh, God...

1096
01:06:36,252 --> 01:06:38,559
Wait. I've got to think...

1097
01:06:38,602 --> 01:06:40,126
think it through, um...

1098
01:06:45,914 --> 01:06:47,611
Hm-hm-hm-hm.

1099
01:06:54,444 --> 01:06:56,403
That was very convincing.

1100
01:06:56,446 --> 01:06:59,406
Anyway... that's number two

1101
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:01,277
ticked off the bucket list.

1102
01:07:01,321 --> 01:07:02,757
Or "licked off
the fuck-it list".

1103
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,847
Quite. And I'm
very happy about that.

1104
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:08,806
You are very good at
this whole business, you know.

1105
01:07:09,285 --> 01:07:11,940
I hope you know.
People should tell you.

1106
01:07:11,983 --> 01:07:14,595
Thank you.
That's nice to hear.

1107
01:07:14,638 --> 01:07:17,293
It's a sort of
mysterious gift you have.

1108
01:07:17,337 --> 01:07:20,166
It's not so mysterious.
I just make the effort.

1109
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:23,647
And I like you, so it's easy.

1110
01:07:23,691 --> 01:07:25,867
See, see? You always know
the right thing to say

1111
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:27,738
when to make the
move and all that.

1112
01:07:27,782 --> 01:07:29,088
You learn to read people.

1113
01:07:30,915 --> 01:07:32,178
I'm not sure I ever have.

1114
01:07:32,221 --> 01:07:33,788
You have to want to first.

1115
01:07:35,094 --> 01:07:38,706
Yeah, I probably don't want
to enough to put in the work.

1116
01:07:40,186 --> 01:07:41,796
I just pay attention.

1117
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:45,756
And what about you? Is there
someone who pays attention to you?

1118
01:07:46,322 --> 01:07:49,108
You know, is there someone?
- Someone?

1119
01:07:49,499 --> 01:07:52,067
Yes, you know, a special person,
a particular person.

1120
01:07:52,937 --> 01:07:54,287
What, other than you?

1121
01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:57,768
Oh, stop it. I mean a
girlfriend, or boyfriend

1122
01:07:57,812 --> 01:08:01,468
or, you know, one of those fluid
arrangements you have these days.

1123
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:02,991
Nancy.
- Leo.

1124
01:08:03,034 --> 01:08:06,951
It's all about this moment,
in this room, right now.

1125
01:08:06,995 --> 01:08:08,039
It's all about you.

1126
01:08:08,475 --> 01:08:10,912
Forget everything else.
That's the whole point.

1127
01:08:12,043 --> 01:08:13,654
Yes, but who are you in there?

1128
01:08:15,351 --> 01:08:17,919
Who are you out there?
That's what I want to know.

1129
01:08:18,746 --> 01:08:21,314
Now I've rebooked you.
- And I'm very glad you did.

1130
01:08:21,357 --> 01:08:24,795
And I am too, but I just thought
maybe we could personalise it a bit.

1131
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:27,233
If it's gonna
be a regular thing.

1132
01:08:28,016 --> 01:08:30,192
I thought you were happy
with what I'm doing.

1133
01:08:30,236 --> 01:08:33,152
Oh my goodness,
believe me, I am.

1134
01:08:33,195 --> 01:08:36,633
My body is no longer the carcass I've
been heaving around for thirty years.

1135
01:08:36,677 --> 01:08:38,766
No, it's now a thing of wonder.

1136
01:08:38,809 --> 01:08:40,681
"A playground of delight",
as you say.

1137
01:08:41,203 --> 01:08:42,422
Did I say that?

1138
01:08:42,987 --> 01:08:45,425
Mm, perhaps not.
But what about you?

1139
01:08:46,556 --> 01:08:47,862
The real you?

1140
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:52,083
I'm whatever
you want me to be...

1141
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,869
here, in this moment.

1142
01:08:56,305 --> 01:08:59,743
Hmm, but what if I want to know
who you are without me?

1143
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,268
When I'm not there.

1144
01:09:03,094 --> 01:09:04,444
Wouldn't that be OK too?

1145
01:09:06,141 --> 01:09:08,970
Nancy, I hope I've given you
what I said I would give you.

1146
01:09:09,013 --> 01:09:10,798
You said we should
get to know each other.

1147
01:09:10,841 --> 01:09:11,886
Nancy.

1148
01:09:13,627 --> 01:09:15,150
So you're not going to tell me.

1149
01:09:15,803 --> 01:09:18,284
Hey, have you ever considered
using sex toys?

1150
01:09:18,762 --> 01:09:20,721
You know,
I actually brought some with me

1151
01:09:20,764 --> 01:09:22,960
because some people find it much easier...
- Actually, in that case

1152
01:09:22,984 --> 01:09:24,464
I've got something to tell you.

1153
01:09:24,942 --> 01:09:27,031
Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

1154
01:09:28,816 --> 01:09:30,470
Well, go on then.

1155
01:09:30,513 --> 01:09:32,913
Well, you know, if you're not
gonna tell me anything yourself

1156
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:34,735
long nights alone...

1157
01:09:35,736 --> 01:09:37,651
one's curiosity
gets the better of one...

1158
01:09:38,521 --> 01:09:40,480
Does it now?
- Yes. It does.

1159
01:09:41,959 --> 01:09:43,874
I know who you are.

1160
01:09:45,441 --> 01:09:47,095
Sorry?

1161
01:09:47,138 --> 01:09:49,880
I know who you are. I found
out who you are in real life.

1162
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:52,405
Don't know what you mean.
This is who I am.

1163
01:09:52,448 --> 01:09:54,842
No, I mean your real name.
I found out your real name.

1164
01:09:54,885 --> 01:09:56,931
I was gonna tell
you earlier, but...

1165
01:09:56,974 --> 01:09:57,932
But...?

1166
01:09:57,975 --> 01:09:59,760
But I thought it was best to...

1167
01:09:59,803 --> 01:10:02,328
To... fuck first?

1168
01:10:02,371 --> 01:10:05,418
Well, it was just a minor bit
of sleuthing on my part.

1169
01:10:05,461 --> 01:10:07,202
You know, on my
credit card statement

1170
01:10:07,246 --> 01:10:09,422
there's a company listed
to your website

1171
01:10:09,465 --> 01:10:11,859
and you just go to
the company's house website

1172
01:10:11,902 --> 01:10:14,296
and you can find the name
of the director of the company

1173
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:16,733
and that's how I found
out your name, you real name.

1174
01:10:19,345 --> 01:10:20,607
Hang on.

1175
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:22,348
Hold on, what's going on?

1176
01:10:24,219 --> 01:10:27,353
No, I'll... I'll tell
you my real name, if you like?

1177
01:10:27,396 --> 01:10:29,616
I don't mind.
- No, thank you, I'm not interested.

1178
01:10:30,181 --> 01:10:31,966
Well, it's not so bad, is it?

1179
01:10:32,532 --> 01:10:33,750
For me to know, I mean, it...

1180
01:10:34,273 --> 01:10:35,970
It's not as if we're strangers.

1181
01:10:36,013 --> 01:10:37,450
I have boundaries.

1182
01:10:37,493 --> 01:10:39,626
I've asked you to respect them.
You haven't

1183
01:10:39,669 --> 01:10:42,629
so I'll be going now. Please
don't attempt to book me again.

1184
01:10:42,672 --> 01:10:43,978
Oh, come on now.

1185
01:10:44,544 --> 01:10:48,199
Come on. It's not so bad.
I'll... I'll forget I mentioned it.

1186
01:10:48,243 --> 01:10:49,244
No.

1187
01:10:49,288 --> 01:10:51,028
I'll still call you "Leo".

1188
01:10:51,072 --> 01:10:53,466
You won't calling me anything
because I won't be here.

1189
01:10:55,032 --> 01:10:56,164
OK, Connor.

1190
01:10:57,513 --> 01:10:58,949
Don't you call me that.

1191
01:10:59,602 --> 01:11:01,343
My name is Leo Grande.

1192
01:11:01,387 --> 01:11:04,085
You booked Leo Grande,
and you got Leo Grande.

1193
01:11:04,128 --> 01:11:06,783
And from what I could tell
by the moans and the sighs

1194
01:11:06,827 --> 01:11:08,916
you have no complaints
with Leo Grande, am I right?

1195
01:11:09,351 --> 01:11:10,352
Yes.
- Good.

1196
01:11:10,396 --> 01:11:11,962
So we're clear on that.

1197
01:11:12,006 --> 01:11:15,749
This is Leo Grande. I
made him, and I'm proud of him.

1198
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:18,795
And by the way, "Nancy Stokes"

1199
01:11:18,839 --> 01:11:21,102
I could find out
who you are myself, you know.

1200
01:11:21,972 --> 01:11:24,061
How do you think
people would react if they knew

1201
01:11:24,105 --> 01:11:26,673
their ex-RE teacher was hiring
young men

1202
01:11:26,716 --> 01:11:28,588
to lick their
pussy in a hotel room?

1203
01:11:28,631 --> 01:11:30,677
What? Is that a
little too real for you?

1204
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,636
Cos that's just what we've just been
doing, so don't get squeamish now.

1205
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:36,204
I honestly didn't think
you'd react like this.

1206
01:11:36,247 --> 01:11:38,380
What?
- Well, I thought you'd be pleased.

1207
01:11:38,424 --> 01:11:39,860
Pleased?

1208
01:11:39,903 --> 01:11:41,751
Well, I thought we'd
built up a trust, a real trust.

1209
01:11:41,775 --> 01:11:43,603
I mean, I was ready
to tell you who I am.

1210
01:11:43,646 --> 01:11:47,433
I thought we could maybe continue
outside of here, have a coffee

1211
01:11:48,042 --> 01:11:49,391
or a drink or something.

1212
01:11:49,435 --> 01:11:50,566
Why can't we?

1213
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:52,612
Why can't we be friends?

1214
01:11:52,655 --> 01:11:54,222
I mean, is it cos I'm old?

1215
01:11:54,265 --> 01:11:56,485
Cos old ladies aren't allowed
to participate in anything

1216
01:11:56,529 --> 01:11:58,357
where have to be kept quiet
and cosseted

1217
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,880
until... oh, until
you need our money

1218
01:11:59,923 --> 01:12:01,248
and then you'll turn up
and do anything.

1219
01:12:01,272 --> 01:12:03,579
Look, I know that's how it feels
with your kids

1220
01:12:03,623 --> 01:12:06,408
but I have never treated you
or thought of you like an old...

1221
01:12:06,452 --> 01:12:08,279
I thought you
were proud of your work.

1222
01:12:08,323 --> 01:12:09,759
Why are you ashamed?

1223
01:12:09,803 --> 01:12:11,544
I'm not ashamed.

1224
01:12:11,587 --> 01:12:13,913
But you're lying about it, you're
hiding yourself, and your work.

1225
01:12:13,937 --> 01:12:15,896
Even from those closest to you.

1226
01:12:15,939 --> 01:12:18,420
You're deluded.
You're crazy and deluded.

1227
01:12:18,464 --> 01:12:20,727
Why can't your mother know
the truth if you're so proud?

1228
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:22,922
If you're not ashamed.
- You know there's a word for this.

1229
01:12:22,946 --> 01:12:25,514
It's called cyber-stalking.
And nutters do it.

1230
01:12:25,906 --> 01:12:28,299
Crazy, sad, desperate
nutters like you.

1231
01:12:28,343 --> 01:12:31,259
Oh, well, I am so sorry that
I had the audacity to find out

1232
01:12:31,302 --> 01:12:34,567
the true identity of the man I've been
having sex with for the past month.

1233
01:12:34,610 --> 01:12:37,091
Why don't you tell me more
about your life on the oil rig?

1234
01:12:37,134 --> 01:12:39,310
Why do you have to lie to me
about who you are?

1235
01:12:39,354 --> 01:12:41,312
I am not lying to you, Nancy!

1236
01:12:42,488 --> 01:12:44,359
This is my professional name.

1237
01:12:44,403 --> 01:12:48,581
I provide a service, a fantasy,
and I told you that very clearly.

1238
01:12:48,624 --> 01:12:51,584
Well, all that stuff you said
about it being a vocation.

1239
01:12:51,627 --> 01:12:52,976
Is that lies?
- No.

1240
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:55,631
She would be proud of
you, surely. She would.

1241
01:12:57,328 --> 01:12:59,113
Why are we
talking about my mother?

1242
01:12:59,156 --> 01:13:02,769
I could talk to her. I was always
very good with the parents.

1243
01:13:02,812 --> 01:13:05,162
I could explain it to her,
I could make her understand.

1244
01:13:05,206 --> 01:13:06,294
No, thank you.

1245
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:09,752
I think it's important. Let me do it.
- I don't need you to do that.

1246
01:13:09,776 --> 01:13:12,213
Well, let me try.
I think it would be good for you

1247
01:13:12,779 --> 01:13:14,258
for your life.

1248
01:13:14,302 --> 01:13:16,957
Nobody is explaining
anything to my mother

1249
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,263
because far as she's concerned,
I'm dead.

1250
01:13:21,135 --> 01:13:23,050
Sorry, what? What? What?
- Yeah.

1251
01:13:23,093 --> 01:13:24,617
That's what she tells everyone.

1252
01:13:26,445 --> 01:13:27,445
There.

1253
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:28,969
Do you feel sexy now?

1254
01:13:29,926 --> 01:13:31,885
Feel like that's
what you're paying for?

1255
01:13:33,408 --> 01:13:36,063
No, I didn't think so.

1256
01:13:37,934 --> 01:13:42,199
Look, Nancy, I'm sorry that
your son is so immensely boring

1257
01:13:42,243 --> 01:13:45,115
and that your daughter has
a more exciting life than you.

1258
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:48,031
You said your kids are like
a dead weight around your neck

1259
01:13:48,075 --> 01:13:51,557
so let's not pretend you're exactly
"Mother of the Year" yourself, right?

1260
01:13:52,209 --> 01:13:57,258
But why would she want you dead?
Why? What did you do to her?

1261
01:13:57,301 --> 01:13:59,565
Fuck off, Nancy.

1262
01:14:19,846 --> 01:14:21,021
Alright.

1263
01:14:23,066 --> 01:14:26,287
Don't talk to me,
I just forgot my phone.

1264
01:14:39,256 --> 01:14:40,256
Fuck.

1265
01:14:42,085 --> 01:14:43,217
Oh, fuck.

1266
01:14:48,439 --> 01:14:49,571
Fuck.

1267
01:14:55,446 --> 01:14:57,448
Leo, please. Please.
- Fuck!

1268
01:14:59,059 --> 01:15:01,322
You wanna know if my
mother would be proud of me?

1269
01:15:02,279 --> 01:15:03,498
Yeah, she disowned me.

1270
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:05,718
She left me to fend for myself.

1271
01:15:06,762 --> 01:15:07,981
How old were you?

1272
01:15:08,503 --> 01:15:09,548
I was 15.

1273
01:15:10,418 --> 01:15:12,812
Why? Why did she disown you?
What did you do?

1274
01:15:13,377 --> 01:15:14,640
What did I do?

1275
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:16,642
What did I do?

1276
01:15:17,294 --> 01:15:19,819
I just disappointed
the fuck out of her.

1277
01:15:27,957 --> 01:15:28,958
Hello?

1278
01:15:30,133 --> 01:15:32,483
No, yes, no, no, no. It's fine.

1279
01:15:32,527 --> 01:15:33,659
It's my friend, he, um...

1280
01:15:34,355 --> 01:15:36,183
he fell,
actually, hurt his knee. Yes.

1281
01:15:37,445 --> 01:15:39,665
Absolutely, no, of course.
We'll keep it down.

1282
01:15:39,708 --> 01:15:41,580
Yes, yes, sorry. Thanks.

1283
01:15:41,623 --> 01:15:42,623
Bye.

1284
01:15:46,149 --> 01:15:48,064
You know, my
mother was like you.

1285
01:15:49,675 --> 01:15:51,024
She did everything right.

1286
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:54,723
Food on the table, clean clothes
in the drawers, all that, but um...

1287
01:15:56,507 --> 01:16:00,033
I don't think she ever...
ever actually saw me.

1288
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:06,779
Or if she did,
she didn't like it.

1289
01:16:09,346 --> 01:16:11,914
You know, she tried
to hide her repulsion

1290
01:16:11,958 --> 01:16:13,873
but I could just feel it...

1291
01:16:15,396 --> 01:16:17,180
vibrating
through the walls, and...

1292
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:21,707
I just... I wasn't what she wanted.
What she imagined for herself.

1293
01:16:24,579 --> 01:16:25,711
I'm sorry.

1294
01:16:25,754 --> 01:16:28,061
Yeah, well, you
can quit judging me

1295
01:16:29,062 --> 01:16:30,716
you know, my life, my work.

1296
01:16:32,021 --> 01:16:34,676
You don't actually care about
the truth of my life.

1297
01:16:35,851 --> 01:16:38,767
You just wanted
something... exotic.

1298
01:16:39,725 --> 01:16:41,335
A broken little whore.

1299
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:44,730
And I guess you found him.

1300
01:16:46,122 --> 01:16:47,254
Well done you.

1301
01:17:10,886 --> 01:17:12,888
I'm gonna leave now, Nancy.

1302
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:17,763
You can have a refund
on the time.

1303
01:18:30,096 --> 01:18:31,575
Can I get you anything?

1304
01:18:31,619 --> 01:18:33,534
No, thanks, I'm
waiting for someone.

1305
01:18:33,577 --> 01:18:34,665
OK.

1306
01:18:43,892 --> 01:18:45,589
Can I get you anything?
- I said no tha...

1307
01:18:45,633 --> 01:18:47,461
Oh, sorry,
you're a different one.

1308
01:18:47,504 --> 01:18:49,463
Thanks a lot, I'm
waiting for someone.

1309
01:18:49,506 --> 01:18:52,335
Can I get you anything while you wait?
- Nothing, thank you.

1310
01:19:01,997 --> 01:19:03,869
Can I get you...
- No, thank you. Sorry.

1311
01:19:03,912 --> 01:19:08,525
Thank you, no, I'm waiting, I
will wait, I will wait for my friend.

1312
01:19:10,092 --> 01:19:11,746
Oh, you used to teach me.

1313
01:19:12,138 --> 01:19:13,661
Sorry?
- Yeah.

1314
01:19:13,704 --> 01:19:15,141
Mrs Robinson. RE.

1315
01:19:15,184 --> 01:19:17,360
Oh, keep your voice
down a little, would you?

1316
01:19:20,189 --> 01:19:21,582
What are you doing here then?

1317
01:19:22,017 --> 01:19:25,586
Um, ah, well, I'm
meeting a friend. Yeah.

1318
01:19:26,717 --> 01:19:28,241
Cos the parking here's so good.

1319
01:19:29,851 --> 01:19:31,810
Well, it's certainly better
than the coffee.

1320
01:19:34,638 --> 01:19:36,466
I'm Becky Foster,
do you remember me?

1321
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:39,078
Um, no, actually.
I... funnily enough, I don't.

1322
01:19:39,121 --> 01:19:41,167
Sorry.
- Yeah, you used to teach me in Year 8.

1323
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:43,014
Did I? I can't have
taught you very well, could I?

1324
01:19:43,038 --> 01:19:44,823
Why's that?
- Cos you're working here.

1325
01:19:45,519 --> 01:19:46,520
Hello.

1326
01:19:46,563 --> 01:19:47,651
Oh!

1327
01:19:47,695 --> 01:19:48,870
Where did you come from?

1328
01:19:49,566 --> 01:19:51,220
Um...
- This your friend, then?

1329
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:55,007
Yeah, well, he's...

1330
01:19:55,834 --> 01:19:58,097
Well...
- Uh, I'm trying to sell my car.

1331
01:19:58,662 --> 01:20:00,664
Um, this good lady is interested

1332
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:03,711
so we thought this was a great
place to meet to have a look at it.

1333
01:20:03,754 --> 01:20:05,713
Mm. Mm-hmm.
Cos the parking's so good.

1334
01:20:05,756 --> 01:20:07,476
Well, it's certainly better
than the coffee.

1335
01:20:09,412 --> 01:20:11,545
We'll take two of
those coffees, anyway.

1336
01:20:11,588 --> 01:20:12,938
We'll take the risk. Thank you.

1337
01:20:21,033 --> 01:20:22,730
Shall we sit?

1338
01:20:24,427 --> 01:20:25,472
Yeah.

1339
01:20:35,264 --> 01:20:36,309
You came.

1340
01:20:37,963 --> 01:20:39,094
You booked.

1341
01:20:39,790 --> 01:20:40,966
I didn't think you would.

1342
01:20:41,792 --> 01:20:43,142
I wasn't sure I would either.

1343
01:20:43,969 --> 01:20:45,666
But we both know the deal today.

1344
01:20:46,623 --> 01:20:49,496
Still, I'm very glad that you
decided to come, just to talk.

1345
01:20:53,979 --> 01:20:54,980
Lovely.

1346
01:20:56,677 --> 01:20:58,200
Thank you.

1347
01:20:58,244 --> 01:20:59,332
Thank you.

1348
01:21:12,301 --> 01:21:13,999
It's a powerful thing.

1349
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:15,914
Sexual fulfilment.

1350
01:21:16,827 --> 01:21:20,005
It makes you feel... Well,
it made me feel invincible.

1351
01:21:20,483 --> 01:21:21,702
I hadn't realised.

1352
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:25,140
I wish I'd known sooner,
when I was younger.

1353
01:21:25,184 --> 01:21:27,186
I'd have made
the necessary changes.

1354
01:21:27,229 --> 01:21:28,622
At least you've done that now.

1355
01:21:28,665 --> 01:21:30,580
Yes. Yes.

1356
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:34,454
And you know, I have felt more alive
and more powerful in this last month

1357
01:21:34,497 --> 01:21:35,934
than I can ever remember.

1358
01:21:36,847 --> 01:21:38,371
I mean, I see my friends...

1359
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:41,287
fading away at the edges.

1360
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:43,245
Just shrivelling up
over the years

1361
01:21:43,289 --> 01:21:44,899
and I think...

1362
01:21:45,639 --> 01:21:48,381
actually, you're right, Leo,
this should be a public service.

1363
01:21:49,773 --> 01:21:52,733
You told a couple of
them about me. Your friends.

1364
01:21:53,647 --> 01:21:57,651
Yes, I have made recommendations
for the great Leo Grande.

1365
01:21:58,739 --> 01:22:00,915
I told them you're the
master of the menopause.

1366
01:22:02,047 --> 01:22:03,744
I'll put it on my business card.

1367
01:22:04,571 --> 01:22:06,051
I've been very
discreet of course.

1368
01:22:06,094 --> 01:22:08,116
I've only told the ones
I thought could really use...

1369
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:10,055
Need it... You... Need you.

1370
01:22:10,925 --> 01:22:12,187
Well, I appreciate that.

1371
01:22:13,101 --> 01:22:14,102
Mm.

1372
01:22:16,539 --> 01:22:17,758
Uh...

1373
01:22:17,801 --> 01:22:20,804
Leo, my name, my real name

1374
01:22:21,414 --> 01:22:22,981
is Susan Robinson.

1375
01:22:23,633 --> 01:22:25,722
Such a boring name, isn't it?

1376
01:22:25,766 --> 01:22:28,769
Mrs Robinson. Hmm.
That's cute.

1377
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:34,079
I've never done anything
interesting or remarkable in my life.

1378
01:22:34,122 --> 01:22:35,602
Um, this is it.

1379
01:22:36,211 --> 01:22:37,996
I always obeyed all the rules

1380
01:22:38,431 --> 01:22:39,475
fell in line.

1381
01:22:40,433 --> 01:22:45,133
I never drank too much, never
overshadowed my husband at parties.

1382
01:22:45,177 --> 01:22:47,135
I was always
the designated driver.

1383
01:22:47,179 --> 01:22:48,658
Ate my five a day.

1384
01:22:48,702 --> 01:22:50,617
Even before they were called
"five a day."

1385
01:22:51,009 --> 01:22:54,142
And I always, always
answer my phone when it rings.

1386
01:22:55,491 --> 01:22:57,624
You're the only adventure
I've ever had.

1387
01:22:58,973 --> 01:23:00,540
The only freedom, and...

1388
01:23:01,541 --> 01:23:03,108
I wanted it to be real.

1389
01:23:04,152 --> 01:23:05,893
I wasn't
thinking about it properly.

1390
01:23:06,763 --> 01:23:10,593
I was mad with some fever...

1391
01:23:11,594 --> 01:23:13,118
lust or whatever.

1392
01:23:14,728 --> 01:23:16,077
It made me mad.

1393
01:23:16,730 --> 01:23:18,253
I never... I've never...

1394
01:23:20,734 --> 01:23:21,996
I'm sorry, Leo.

1395
01:23:22,910 --> 01:23:23,910
I'm so...

1396
01:23:33,964 --> 01:23:36,097
That's it.
- Mm. That's it.

1397
01:23:36,141 --> 01:23:38,665
I just wanted to see you,
see you were alright.

1398
01:23:39,492 --> 01:23:41,320
Tell you what
you've done for me.

1399
01:23:42,147 --> 01:23:44,323
To thank you and to say goodbye.

1400
01:23:46,281 --> 01:23:48,196
Everything OK
here, Mrs Robinson?

1401
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:51,417
Yes, um, thank you.
We're just wrapping up here now.

1402
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:53,593
Mrs Robinson used to
teach me RE at school.

1403
01:23:53,636 --> 01:23:54,768
Oh, yeah?

1404
01:23:54,811 --> 01:23:56,030
Thank you, Becky.

1405
01:23:56,074 --> 01:23:57,771
Yes.
- Was she a good teacher?

1406
01:23:57,814 --> 01:23:59,860
She was alright. Bit uptight.

1407
01:24:00,339 --> 01:24:02,210
Not as bad as some of the others.
- Uh-huh.

1408
01:24:02,254 --> 01:24:04,995
Yeah. Except
for this one time...

1409
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:07,085
Thank you, Becky,
for that glowing report.

1410
01:24:07,128 --> 01:24:09,478
She got all us girls together
for a special assembly.

1411
01:24:09,522 --> 01:24:11,263
Becky...
- No, no, go on.

1412
01:24:11,306 --> 01:24:13,439
And she told us
we were all sluts.

1413
01:24:13,482 --> 01:24:15,615
I don't think that's quite
what happened, Becky.

1414
01:24:15,658 --> 01:24:18,400
Yeah, she said girls
should look respectable

1415
01:24:18,444 --> 01:24:21,316
or we would go around tempting
the men and get ourselves into trouble.

1416
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:24,276
She said if we looked like
sluts, we'd be treated like sluts.

1417
01:24:24,319 --> 01:24:26,582
Well, it was to do with
the length of the skirts mostly

1418
01:24:26,626 --> 01:24:28,410
which had just got
out of control by then.

1419
01:24:28,454 --> 01:24:31,021
Said if we spent as much time
on our studies

1420
01:24:31,065 --> 01:24:33,589
as we did on our hair,
we'd all be a lot better off.

1421
01:24:33,633 --> 01:24:36,070
Well, actually, I do... I
stand by that. I stand by that.

1422
01:24:36,114 --> 01:24:37,376
"Concupiscence".

1423
01:24:37,941 --> 01:24:39,508
Always remember that, too.

1424
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:40,988
She used to make us say...

1425
01:24:41,902 --> 01:24:43,469
Said she liked the sound of it.

1426
01:24:43,512 --> 01:24:44,818
I did too.

1427
01:24:44,861 --> 01:24:47,037
Well, I'm glad to hear it.
It's a good word.

1428
01:24:47,081 --> 01:24:49,214
What does it mean?
- "Lustful desire".

1429
01:24:49,257 --> 01:24:52,217
Oh. Well, well.
Now you're talking.

1430
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:54,132
Mm. Yes, St Augustine of Hippo

1431
01:24:54,175 --> 01:24:56,264
coined the term
in his doctrine of original sin.

1432
01:24:56,308 --> 01:24:58,416
He believed that it underpins all
the suffering and sins in the world.

1433
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:00,181
So Becky, could we
please have that bill?

1434
01:25:00,225 --> 01:25:02,183
Well, I don't think I can
go along with that

1435
01:25:02,227 --> 01:25:04,925
cos it doesn't make any
"Concupi-sense" to me at all.

1436
01:25:07,493 --> 01:25:08,755
Longest word I know.

1437
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:11,018
The bill, please, Becky!

1438
01:25:16,371 --> 01:25:18,678
My legacy. As an educator.

1439
01:25:21,289 --> 01:25:24,684
"Concupiscence".
It is a good word.

1440
01:25:24,727 --> 01:25:26,251
It's a new one on me.

1441
01:25:26,294 --> 01:25:28,054
Oh, well, I'm glad to
have found one you didn't know.

1442
01:25:28,078 --> 01:25:29,079
I was hoping I would.

1443
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,042
I... I told my brother.

1444
01:25:35,434 --> 01:25:36,435
About what I do.

1445
01:25:37,914 --> 01:25:39,655
What did he say?

1446
01:25:39,699 --> 01:25:42,963
Well, he was surprised
to hear me say it, out loud.

1447
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:46,967
But he guessed I made money
with something like this.

1448
01:25:47,010 --> 01:25:49,361
He, um, he said he
kind of already knew.

1449
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:53,147
And he never believed
the oil rig stories.

1450
01:25:55,018 --> 01:25:57,586
He said Mum would
never talk about me.

1451
01:25:58,631 --> 01:26:00,720
About what she saw.
About what happened.

1452
01:26:03,244 --> 01:26:04,289
Mm.

1453
01:26:04,854 --> 01:26:06,856
Guess I was a
bit wild for my mum.

1454
01:26:08,467 --> 01:26:09,859
A lot for her to handle.

1455
01:26:11,774 --> 01:26:15,082
There was this one night,
back then when I thought...

1456
01:26:15,125 --> 01:26:17,171
uh, she was gone out
for the weekend.

1457
01:26:17,911 --> 01:26:19,913
But I was wrong, um...

1458
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:24,265
I had some friends over
to hang out after exams

1459
01:26:24,309 --> 01:26:26,572
we put on some
music, drank some wine...

1460
01:26:27,834 --> 01:26:31,664
Next thing I know, she and a neighbour
are walking in on me and my friends

1461
01:26:32,186 --> 01:26:33,231
and we're all...

1462
01:26:34,710 --> 01:26:37,670
bodies wrapped up together,
bit of everything going on.

1463
01:26:39,149 --> 01:26:42,849
Um... exploring each other.

1464
01:26:45,547 --> 01:26:47,332
And I'll never forget her face.

1465
01:26:48,028 --> 01:26:51,118
Just humiliated. So ashamed.

1466
01:26:54,164 --> 01:26:56,950
We tried for weeks after
to patch things up, but, um...

1467
01:26:58,821 --> 01:27:00,649
her disgust was
just all over her.

1468
01:27:00,693 --> 01:27:02,695
I... had to leave.

1469
01:27:04,827 --> 01:27:07,352
She, um, said she
was glad I was going

1470
01:27:07,395 --> 01:27:09,658
and that she would never speak
my name again.

1471
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:13,227
And from that point on

1472
01:27:13,271 --> 01:27:16,012
she told everyone that that
was the day her son had died.

1473
01:27:16,056 --> 01:27:17,144
Mm.

1474
01:27:20,147 --> 01:27:22,758
Surely, surely,
time's a great...

1475
01:27:22,802 --> 01:27:24,020
Healer? Yeah.
- ...healer.

1476
01:27:25,370 --> 01:27:27,676
No, Nancy, she... she meant it.

1477
01:27:29,069 --> 01:27:31,506
I even saw her a couple
of years ago in the street.

1478
01:27:31,550 --> 01:27:34,117
She just... she walked
straight past me.

1479
01:27:37,512 --> 01:27:38,992
Yeah, just cold.

1480
01:27:41,908 --> 01:27:43,953
Would you do
that to your own son?

1481
01:27:43,997 --> 01:27:46,782
Well, only because he's so
unremarkable I might not notice him.

1482
01:27:50,438 --> 01:27:52,745
I should probably stop saying
things like that about him.

1483
01:27:52,788 --> 01:27:54,355
Yeah, you probably should.

1484
01:27:54,790 --> 01:27:57,184
No, he's a good boy
and I'm very lucky to have him.

1485
01:27:59,491 --> 01:28:01,841
She was wrong, your mother.

1486
01:28:01,884 --> 01:28:06,541
There is nothing disgusting
or disappointing about you.

1487
01:28:10,632 --> 01:28:11,807
Thank you, Becky.

1488
01:28:12,721 --> 01:28:14,157
Becky, could you wait a moment?

1489
01:28:18,901 --> 01:28:20,816
Becky, I would
like to apologise to you.

1490
01:28:21,904 --> 01:28:23,341
What?
- Yes.

1491
01:28:23,384 --> 01:28:24,603
I owe you an apology.

1492
01:28:25,081 --> 01:28:27,345
For calling you a slut.
That was wrong.

1493
01:28:27,388 --> 01:28:29,825
That was not a word
or idea I should have used

1494
01:28:29,869 --> 01:28:32,262
with a group
of impressionable teenage girls.

1495
01:28:32,306 --> 01:28:34,787
I thought I was doing
the right thing at the time...

1496
01:28:36,049 --> 01:28:39,182
trying to
protect you, but now...

1497
01:28:41,794 --> 01:28:42,969
But now, I...

1498
01:28:46,102 --> 01:28:47,147
Becky...

1499
01:28:47,930 --> 01:28:49,802
I am not here
to buy this man's car.

1500
01:28:50,542 --> 01:28:51,543
OK.

1501
01:28:51,586 --> 01:28:55,373
This is
Leo Grande and he is a...

1502
01:28:59,159 --> 01:29:00,290
I'm a sex worker.

1503
01:29:00,334 --> 01:29:01,857
Yes. Yes.

1504
01:29:01,901 --> 01:29:04,207
And we have been meeting

1505
01:29:04,251 --> 01:29:06,732
for sex regularly
for the past few weeks.

1506
01:29:06,775 --> 01:29:08,318
That's right.
- That's right, that's right.

1507
01:29:08,342 --> 01:29:11,476
And, um, I recommend him highly

1508
01:29:11,519 --> 01:29:14,914
cos from anything else he's an
absolute marvel with his tongue.

1509
01:29:14,957 --> 01:29:18,613
And, um, Becky, you
may already know this

1510
01:29:18,657 --> 01:29:22,312
I hope you do, but
pleasure is a wonderful thing.

1511
01:29:23,009 --> 01:29:24,576
It's something
we should all have.

1512
01:29:28,144 --> 01:29:29,189
Um...

1513
01:29:29,711 --> 01:29:31,409
If you'll excuse us

1514
01:29:31,452 --> 01:29:33,323
uh, I have a
room booked upstairs

1515
01:29:33,367 --> 01:29:35,500
and um,
Leo and I need to get going

1516
01:29:35,543 --> 01:29:37,937
if we want to fit a session in
in the remaining time

1517
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:39,460
cos, um...

1518
01:29:39,504 --> 01:29:41,462
...there's a couple of things
I'd like to try.

1519
01:29:52,517 --> 01:29:53,953
It was great to meet you, Becky.

1520
01:29:53,996 --> 01:29:57,260
I hope maybe we'll run into
each other again sometime.

1521
01:30:01,526 --> 01:30:02,701
Keep the change.

1522
01:30:20,936 --> 01:30:23,286
Take those off, Nancy Stokes.

1523
01:30:36,474 --> 01:30:38,539
I can't bal... I can't balance
like this. I can't balance.

1524
01:30:38,563 --> 01:30:39,563
OK.

1525
01:30:40,695 --> 01:30:41,696
Oh-oh...

1526
01:31:16,165 --> 01:31:17,210
Did you?

1527
01:31:17,253 --> 01:31:18,559
Stop asking.

1528
01:31:18,603 --> 01:31:20,605
OK.
- You're fixated.

1529
01:31:21,431 --> 01:31:22,694
I think you should drop it.

1530
01:31:24,870 --> 01:31:26,306
I know, I know, I just...

1531
01:31:26,698 --> 01:31:29,352
There's no pressure, of course,
I was just hoping.

1532
01:31:29,396 --> 01:31:31,790
Maybe all the others are faking.

1533
01:31:32,573 --> 01:31:33,879
Have you ever thought of that?

1534
01:31:39,754 --> 01:31:41,147
No.
- I'm joking.

1535
01:31:43,715 --> 01:31:45,717
We'll try one
more time. Just for fun.

1536
01:31:47,457 --> 01:31:49,503
Oh, OK. If you must...

1537
01:31:52,071 --> 01:31:53,507
Close your eyes.

1538
01:32:03,299 --> 01:32:05,171
Hang on, I brought something
with me

1539
01:32:05,214 --> 01:32:06,825
that you might like to try.

1540
01:32:07,477 --> 01:32:08,653
Oh, you know what?

1541
01:32:08,696 --> 01:32:10,393
Leo, I don't think I can.

1542
01:32:10,829 --> 01:32:13,875
I... I think I'm done.

1543
01:32:42,904 --> 01:32:44,863
I thought I brought
the little bugger.

1544
01:32:46,299 --> 01:32:47,561
It usually works.

1545
01:33:02,228 --> 01:33:03,664
Here it is.

1546
01:33:05,187 --> 01:33:06,145
Mm.

1547
01:33:06,188 --> 01:33:07,276
Was that...

1548
01:33:32,084 --> 01:33:35,827
Leo, I think this should be
the last time we meet.

1549
01:33:38,351 --> 01:33:39,569
I'm glad you booked me.

1550
01:33:40,179 --> 01:33:43,617
I'm glad you came.
- I'm glad you came.

1551
01:33:45,401 --> 01:33:46,401
Right?

1552
01:33:47,795 --> 01:33:50,406
I'm very satisfied customer,
put it like that.

1553
01:33:50,450 --> 01:33:54,628
I shall be ticking the big green
smiley face on the feedback form.

1554
01:33:55,847 --> 01:33:56,978
OK.

1555
01:33:59,589 --> 01:34:00,590
Well...

1556
01:34:01,026 --> 01:34:02,026
Well...

1557
01:34:02,854 --> 01:34:04,812
Good bye, then, Leo Grande.

1558
01:34:05,465 --> 01:34:06,814
And good luck to you.

1559
01:34:10,905 --> 01:34:12,124
Good luck to you.

1560
01:34:14,953 --> 01:34:16,171
Take care, Nancy.

1560
01:34:17,305 --> 01:35:17,161
