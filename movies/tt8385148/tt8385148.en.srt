my personal hero...

Michael Bryce.

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,801

20
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:31,067

Tik tok, motherfucker.

32
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,471
And how often do you have this dream?

33
00:02:31,495 --> 00:02:34,676
- Just once... a night.
- Oh. Well that's not...

34

Right.

Mostly when I'm asleep.

36
00:02:37,713 --> 00:02:39,869
It's what my life was supposed to be.

37
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:43,402
I was the perfect executive protection agent
till I lost it all.

38
00:02:44,596 --> 00:02:47,777
When Darius Kincaid
killed my most important client.

39

Darius Kincaid is a relative of yours?

40

God no!

He's a hitman, wanted for like
a gazillion murders around the world.

42
00:02:57,204 --> 00:02:59,049
Even took a bullet for him.

43
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:02,009
Body-guarding committee,
they wouldn't recognize it.

44
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:04,978
Apparently they don't take kindly
to protecting sociopaths.

45
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:05,915
So, in two weeks

46
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:09,900
I have to go in front of a tribunal
and try to get my triple A rated license back.

47
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:13,610
To deal with the future, we sometimes
have to deal with the past.

48
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:17,290
Quite often validation issues
stem from a disapproving father.

49
00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:19,618
I don't have validation issues.

50
00:03:19,642 --> 00:03:23,671
I have a licensing issue.
I am bodyguard without a license.

51
00:03:23,695 --> 00:03:27,665
That's like being a belly dancer,
without a torso.

52
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:30,563
I'm thinking, you need to forget
body-guarding for a while.

53
00:03:30,587 --> 00:03:33,431
- And find happiness within.
- Within what?

54
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:34,901
Within yourself.

55

Happiness in who you are.

56
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:40,235
I'm listening.

57
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:44,065
Well, first things first, I think
all the guns and violence

58
00:03:44,352 --> 00:03:46,315
are weighing on your soul.

59
00:03:46,345 --> 00:03:49,727
So, you need to get away
and clear your mind, and then,

60
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,065
you can find your future self.

61
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:55,222

00:03:55,423 --> 00:03:56,839

- No. Will you stop?

64
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:04,034
Stop thinking about body guarding.

65

so, how about Tuscany?

67

No. No. Not Tuscany. No.
No Tuscany. Anything but Tuscany.

73
00:04:31,254 --> 00:04:34,036
I could leave him voice messages,
I have my phone with me, all the time.

check in with me again,

78

00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:21,279
is Michael Bryce doing here?

324
00:19:21,683 --> 00:19:23,402
You said,

325
00:19:23,426 --> 00:19:25,958
Baby! Get me Michael Bryce!

326
00:19:26,183 --> 00:19:27,380
What?

327
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:29,518
No! No, no, no, no.

328
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:31,731
I said, Baby, I need help.

329
00:19:32,266 --> 00:19:34,097
Get anyone, but

330
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,354
- Michael Bryce.
- What?

331
00:19:36,378 --> 00:19:38,292
Didn't he save your cucaracha ass?

332
00:19:38,316 --> 00:19:40,646
Doesn't mean I gotta be
best friends with him.

333
00:19:40,692 --> 00:19:44,639
He is the most annoying
motherfucker on planet earth.

334
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,161
Excuse me.

335
00:19:46,308 --> 00:19:47,909
I have 20/20 hearing.

336
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:49,917
I can hear you.
The dead guys...

337
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:50,830
can hear you.

338
00:19:50,854 --> 00:19:53,581
And what do you mean I'm the most
annoying motherfucker on planet earth?

339
00:19:53,605 --> 00:19:55,972
How many times
have you nearly got me killed?

340
00:19:55,996 --> 00:19:57,714
Not enough!

341
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,199
Come on Baby, let's get outta here,

342
00:19:59,223 --> 00:20:02,067
before he starts the
in-flight safety demonstration.

343
00:20:08,214 --> 00:20:10,435
Are you using pepper spray?

344
00:20:11,027 --> 00:20:12,841
I'm on sabbatical.

345
00:20:13,785 --> 00:20:16,646
And uh, trying to find my spiritual me

346
00:20:18,363 --> 00:20:19,614
awake.

347
00:20:26,785 --> 00:20:28,630
Hey!

348
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,942
I didn't have to be here, you know.

349
00:20:32,785 --> 00:20:35,833
I had fresh cucumbers on my eyes.

350
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,628
I had a linen rope

351
00:20:37,652 --> 00:20:41,074
with an insanely high thread count,
it was like sleeping in the cloud.

352
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:43,435
Namaste motherfucker.

353
00:20:43,715 --> 00:20:45,099
No!

354
00:20:45,394 --> 00:20:46,778
Darius?

355
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,315
The hitman, the bodyguard
and the con woman.

356
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:52,354
You dumb fucks just killed Carlo,

357
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:54,659
the informant
that was gonna punch my ticket home.

358
00:20:54,683 --> 00:20:56,011
Who the fuck are you?

359
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:58,942
Interpol agent, Bobby O'Neill.
That's who the fuck I am.

360
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:02,052
And I know
who all three of you shitheads are.

361
00:21:02,276 --> 00:21:05,348
Michael Bryce, triple A rated bodyguard.

362
00:21:05,487 --> 00:21:07,940
- Pillar of the community.
- Present. Thank you.

363
00:21:07,964 --> 00:21:10,487
Only I know,
you lost your license to protect when

364
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:12,645
Shotgun Willy here killed Kurosawa.

365
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:15,112
No, no. That's under review. Okay?
Kincaid took that shot...

366
00:21:15,136 --> 00:21:16,700
Moreover...

367
00:21:18,206 --> 00:21:20,034
You're still taking clients.

368
00:21:20,058 --> 00:21:22,355
Name one.

369
00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:25,609
The Sultan of Modora, Brussels.

370
00:21:25,662 --> 00:21:29,437
Your Majesty, I'm Michael Bryce,
your executive protection agent.

371
00:21:30,997 --> 00:21:32,647
<i>Contact, contact!</i>

372
00:21:32,755 --> 00:21:34,223
That's a felony, pal.

373
00:21:34,247 --> 00:21:36,186
Fucking Brussels, fuck!

374
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:40,073
As for you two, you're looking
at about a billion years in prison.

375
00:21:40,097 --> 00:21:43,823
But, today is your lucky day.
Instead of going to the electric chair

376
00:21:43,847 --> 00:21:46,354
I'm gonna give you a shot at redemption.

377
00:21:46,378 --> 00:21:48,252
Now, I got Intel,
on a mystery big shot

378
00:21:48,276 --> 00:21:50,979
that's about to launch
a full scale cyber attack.

379
00:21:51,003 --> 00:21:53,143
Carlo, my now dead informant

380
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:56,034
was gonna buy a hard drive
containing the co-ordinates for the attack.

381
00:21:56,058 --> 00:21:57,010
Why don't you hear me?
I didn't know.

382
00:21:57,034 --> 00:21:59,393
But now, thanks to your bloodbath,

383
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:00,770
that can't happen.

384
00:22:00,794 --> 00:22:02,948
So, you assholes are going to Portofino.

385
00:22:02,972 --> 00:22:04,635
And you're gonna make the buy instead.

386
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:07,144
Bob? A quick sideward?

387
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,901
Listen. First off,

388
00:22:10,925 --> 00:22:13,307
I'm happy to postpone my sabbatical

389
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:15,573
if it's gonna keep me out of jail.

390
00:22:15,597 --> 00:22:18,971
But I think, you know, you should really
reconsider working with these guys.

391
00:22:18,995 --> 00:22:20,543
- I don't wanna go to Portofino.
- Because they are...

392
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:23,356
-  you know, fucking crazy.
- <i>...No. I don't.</i>

393
00:22:24,786 --> 00:22:26,083
Fuck. Wow.

394
00:22:26,107 --> 00:22:27,810
Okay, colorful drinks,

395
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:32,418
you are gonna be the goofy bodyguard
for Carlo's British mistress.

396
00:22:32,442 --> 00:22:35,434
While Grumpy pants here,
makes sure that hard drive gets out.

397
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,106
Are we clear?

398
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,043
We could just take the money
and run, baby.

399
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,364
No. I'm tired of running, Darius.

400
00:22:40,388 --> 00:22:42,840
Ah. Superintendent Crowley, how nice.

401
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:44,965
I don't wanna go Portofino
as his bitch.

402
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,303
Did you guys see
how hard that guy punches?

403
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,957
What if somebody's upstairs?

404
00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:53,357
Shut up.

405
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:55,745
Change of plans.

406
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:58,549
There's been a heist in a
shipping dock and it could be related

407
00:22:58,573 --> 00:23:00,526
but that does not change
what's happening here.

408
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:03,636
Now, Sean Connery, here is gonna give you
a bunch of money to make the buy.

409
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,753
Do you see that?
That's your buy money.

410
00:23:05,777 --> 00:23:08,230
One dime goes missing,
you try to go AWOL

411
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,878
and I'm gonna slap global red fucking notices
on all your asses.

412
00:23:10,902 --> 00:23:13,636
- Oh no. Not red notices.
- Red notices. What are you doing?

413
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,294
I'm not. On me?

414
00:23:15,318 --> 00:23:16,761
- What is this? A Nokia?
- Listen to me.

415
00:23:16,785 --> 00:23:17,971
I don't know how to even work this thing.

416
00:23:17,995 --> 00:23:20,394
- Look at me. Look at me.
- I'm looking. I'm looking at you.

417
00:23:20,418 --> 00:23:22,073
You stay in close contact with me.
You understand?

418
00:23:22,097 --> 00:23:23,347
- I'll call you all the time.
- Shut up.

419
00:23:23,371 --> 00:23:25,011
When I call, you answer.

420
00:23:25,035 --> 00:23:25,784
And you...

421
00:23:25,808 --> 00:23:27,911
resources are kinda low.

422
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:31,357
Why don't you enjoy
your transportation?

423
00:23:31,902 --> 00:23:34,402
Do not fuck this up.

424
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:36,880
Oh, we are definitely
going to fuck this up.

425
00:23:36,904 --> 00:23:39,093
I mean look at the two people
you are saddling me with.

426
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:42,118
- Get your asses to Portofino.
- Zero chance of making it out of this room.

427
00:23:42,142 --> 00:23:44,612
You may as well hire
brain damaged, kidney...

428
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:47,102
Fucking honeymoon, it's over!

429
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,394
It's not gonna work.

430
00:23:53,096 --> 00:23:56,689
I understand some people get cold feet
on their wedding day.

431
00:23:56,713 --> 00:23:59,774
But I'd have never thought that
you'd get cold dick

432
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:01,353
on our honeymoon night.

433
00:24:01,377 --> 00:24:03,707
Baby, baby. I said I was sorry.

434
00:24:03,987 --> 00:24:06,774
Sorry is not good enough,
I want an explanation.

435
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:08,457
Where the fuck were you?

436
00:24:08,846 --> 00:24:10,806
Where were you, Darius? Just tell her.

437
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,012
- I took a job. Okay?
- Fuck you.

438
00:24:13,057 --> 00:24:15,246
- Hey! Hey!
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

439
00:24:15,635 --> 00:24:19,103
Now is a good time
to talk about seat belt rule.

440
00:24:19,127 --> 00:24:22,024
Perhaps now is the good time
to talk about the "shut the fuck up" rule.

441
00:24:22,048 --> 00:24:24,469
I'm just saying it because she's driving
like a crash test dummy.

442
00:24:24,493 --> 00:24:26,907
Do not criticize my wife's driving,
motherfucker.

443
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:28,329
Hush! Hush!

444
00:24:28,353 --> 00:24:30,565
Do you know what I just realized?

445
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:34,284
I'm not gonna let you crazy motherfuckers
ruin my shit.

446
00:24:34,993 --> 00:24:38,587
I'll treat this as a
lovely road trip through Italy

447
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:41,635
and I'll just pretend that you are
still my devoted husband.

448
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:42,666
I am.

449
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,610
And you Bryce, you will be,
you will be the human luggage.

450
00:24:45,634 --> 00:24:46,876
Yes.

451
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,844
We are now on honeymoon.

452
00:24:48,868 --> 00:24:50,829
First of all, it's a mission.

453
00:24:50,853 --> 00:24:52,579
Second of all, and just so we are clear

454
00:24:52,603 --> 00:24:54,602
I promised my therapist
no body-guarding.

455
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,563
So, I'm not protecting
either one of you.

456
00:24:56,587 --> 00:24:59,086
This is not mission.
This is honeymoon.

457
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:02,729
What the fuck!
Hey! Eyes on road! Eyes on road!

458
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:08,292
Babies need to be created
in a stimulating environment.

459
00:25:08,705 --> 00:25:14,235
I must be aroused by
sightseeing, shopping, fine dining.

460
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:16,868
But we are officially on honeymoon.

461
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:18,735
- For real?
- Did she say fine dining?

462
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:21,956
Let's not do that, guys.
Let's just focus on the road here.

463
00:25:22,837 --> 00:25:24,401
Alright.

464
00:25:24,462 --> 00:25:27,838
I got it. No. It's fine.
You guys have at it.

465
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,253
Maybe feather the break a bit.

466
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:32,222
Maybe feather the break a bit!

467
00:25:32,305 --> 00:25:36,580
♪ Tu vuò fà l'Americano - Renato Carosone ♪

468
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,494
- Yo, let me borrow your phone.
- Why did you lie to her?

469
00:25:39,642 --> 00:25:41,008
The fuck are you talking about?

470
00:25:41,032 --> 00:25:43,298
You lied to her back there.
You weren't on job.

471
00:25:43,322 --> 00:25:45,141
And how would you know that?

472
00:25:45,165 --> 00:25:48,187
Because, there's like
22 two body indications

473
00:25:48,211 --> 00:25:51,136
when somebody lies,
 and you exhibited 40.

474
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:58,126
You say one word to Sonia about this,
I'll invent new ways to kill your ass.

475
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,548
Wow. You must have done
something really serious, Darius.

476
00:26:01,572 --> 00:26:02,948
Honesty is the best policy.

477
00:26:02,972 --> 00:26:05,993
I don't take relationship advice
from single motherfuckers.

478
00:26:06,017 --> 00:26:08,214
I don't have a calling plan.

I took a job, okay?

481
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:29,545
Portofino has water views
which means it's perfect for us to...

482
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:31,485
- Oh shit!
- Where are you going?

What the fuck?

You better hope that job was worth it,
motherfucker.

What job?

Who the fuck is Carmen?

Ticket to the opera Carmen,

Oh my God!

What's that thumping?
I can't stop.

494
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,280
God! You people...

495
00:27:36,505 --> 00:27:38,218
fucking insane!

Hey! Watch your mouth!

497
00:27:40,435 --> 00:27:43,317
I picked you up from the street,
saved you from sun stroke,

498
00:27:43,341 --> 00:27:44,856
and now you're calling me insane?

499
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,514
Sun stroke?

500
00:27:46,739 --> 00:27:49,707
You could go to jail
for leaving a dog in a hot car.

501
00:27:49,731 --> 00:27:52,238
And don't even get me started
on the psychological ramifications

502
00:27:52,262 --> 00:27:54,218
of what I heard you two doing.

Is that Valentino?
- No it's mine.

Did you spend the buy money?

505
00:27:59,685 --> 00:28:02,083
Come on, they totally expect us
to spent some of it.

506
00:28:02,107 --> 00:28:04,067
Yeah. No, no. Obviously,

I'm covered with my life savings.

508

I think it's a great idea.

509
00:28:09,794 --> 00:28:11,247
I'm just gonna make a call.

510
00:28:11,271 --> 00:28:12,958
Wish I had some life savings.

00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,606
Hello! You've reached Michael Bryce.

512
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,804
Please leave a message
and have a triple A day.

513
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,819
Hello, Mr Muron, well, we're...

514
00:28:20,122 --> 00:28:21,616
we're way off course.

515
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:23,512
Can't even see the course anymore

516
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,202
Or hear it, for that matter.

517
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,553
My ears are still ringing from...

518
00:28:28,716 --> 00:28:34,272
from ferocious sexual intercourse
leading to a rolling quadruple climax.

519
00:28:35,168 --> 00:28:36,639
Anyway, I'm venting.

520
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:39,889
I don't wanna vent to you.
So, I'll catch up with you later.

521
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:41,944
Shit!

522
00:28:43,349 --> 00:28:45,241
Who were you talking to?

523
00:28:45,966 --> 00:28:47,202
That's a secret.

524
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:49,231
I know your secret.

525
00:28:49,255 --> 00:28:50,087
You do?

526
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:52,569
You are so lonely
that you are talking to yourself.

527
00:28:55,197 --> 00:28:58,102
Listen, Bryce,
you really hurt my feelings.

528
00:28:58,126 --> 00:29:00,081
Do you really think I'm crazy?

529
00:29:00,267 --> 00:29:02,415
No. I think you are...

530
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:03,798
unusually aggressive.

531
00:29:03,822 --> 00:29:05,852
Violent, but in an unpredictable way.

532
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:07,485
I'd make a great mother,
don't you think?

533
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:08,876
I think you will. Yes.

534
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,698
Oh my God, a child would be so lucky
to have you as its host.

535
00:29:15,095 --> 00:29:18,526
Thank you, Bryce, thank you.

536
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,553
It must be your

537
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:26,620
powerful asexuality
that makes you such a good listener.

538
00:29:28,211 --> 00:29:30,735
Let me guess,
Crowley gave us some shit lead.

539
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:34,321
No one will tell me what was inside.
It was classified military shipment.

540
00:29:34,345 --> 00:29:36,011
Whoa! Whoa!

541
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,480
What are the fucking odds?

542
00:29:38,564 --> 00:29:40,542
Seems lightening strikes twice.

543
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:43,803
We need to get that packing slip.

544
00:29:43,827 --> 00:29:46,112
And how do you propose
we do that, Mr Bobby?

545
00:29:49,962 --> 00:29:51,377
What?

546
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,657
Jesus! What the fuck are you doing?

547
00:30:01,681 --> 00:30:03,303
Son of a bitch!

548
00:30:03,327 --> 00:30:05,115
Last time I saw something like this

549
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:06,983

Bobby, I'm glad you called.

552
00:30:11,865 --> 00:30:13,937
Listen, it's a diamond tip drill.

553
00:30:13,961 --> 00:30:17,068
And I know there's a link.
But this drill was fucking massive.

554
00:30:17,092 --> 00:30:18,240
You were right.

555
00:30:18,264 --> 00:30:20,375
We picked up some chatter
in our Rome office.

556
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:22,396
The mob are making a buy in Portofino.

557
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,700
They are purchasing classified co-ordinates
of a large scale data grid.

558
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:26,989
<i>We've got a surveillance team there...</i>

559
00:30:27,013 --> 00:30:28,630
We have a team in Portofino?

560
00:30:28,654 --> 00:30:30,460
<i>Yeah, moving into position now.</i>

561
00:30:30,484 --> 00:30:31,981
Get the chopper. Get the chopper.

562
00:30:32,005 --> 00:30:35,296
Oh Bobby, if this actually turns out to be
what you say it is

563
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,817
<i>I will personally make sure
you get your transfer back to Boston.</i>

564
00:30:38,841 --> 00:30:42,240
Ma'am, I can't, I can't thank you enough.
Thank you so much. Thank you, Ma'am.

565
00:30:42,264 --> 00:30:44,039
We're going to Portofino.

Let's get in the character.
I'm the bodyguard.

568
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:59,950
Now, let's hear the British accent of
Carlo's mistress.

569
00:30:59,974 --> 00:31:02,114
My British accent is perfect,
you fucking cunt.

570
00:31:02,138 --> 00:31:05,780
Let's skip the British accent,
and go straight to being brutally executed.

571
00:31:05,888 --> 00:31:07,710
How's the sideline, D?

572
00:31:08,693 --> 00:31:11,601
Just protecting my ASS-SET.

573
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:14,969
We are here to see Vladimir.

574
00:31:17,772 --> 00:31:19,357
I'm the bodyguard.

575
00:31:19,381 --> 00:31:21,078
Security check.

576
00:31:22,584 --> 00:31:24,336
Two minutes out.

577
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,724
Crowley's got a team in place.
We gotta call off the buy.

578
00:31:27,748 --> 00:31:30,859
If she finds out I've got
those three shit heads working for me...

579
00:31:39,139 --> 00:31:40,953
He's not answering the phone.

580
00:31:41,178 --> 00:31:43,813
What did I tell?
Burner Phone, pick it up!

581
00:31:44,108 --> 00:31:46,758
- Here you go, sir.
- Thank you very much. Great work.

582
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,592
Yummy.

583
00:31:52,616 --> 00:31:54,153
Oh, shit!

584
00:31:54,177 --> 00:31:55,169
What's wrong?

585
00:31:55,193 --> 00:31:58,078
Just a former client. But it's fine.
He didn't see me.

586
00:32:01,692 --> 00:32:04,609
You must be Vladimir.

587
00:32:05,178 --> 00:32:07,320
Carlo sends his regards.

588
00:32:07,545 --> 00:32:10,008
He thought that
I would attract less attention.

589
00:32:10,092 --> 00:32:11,890
Well, he thought wrong.

590
00:32:12,006 --> 00:32:14,156
But nobody's complaining.

591
00:32:14,202 --> 00:32:16,047
Son of a bitch.

592
00:32:19,513 --> 00:32:21,459
Do we have the security feed yet?

593
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:23,004
Getting it now.

594
00:32:23,028 --> 00:32:25,685
Don't move till the buy is made
and they are out of the club.

595
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:27,813
- There is too many civilians.
- Roger that.

596
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:39,352
These are the classified co-ordinates
to the entire European data grid.

597
00:32:40,202 --> 00:32:41,836
Okay?

598
00:32:42,241 --> 00:32:44,172
No, no.

599
00:32:46,201 --> 00:32:48,687
These are proximity pairs.

600
00:32:50,014 --> 00:32:53,818
Until the buyer's fingerprints
disarms the bracelet

601
00:32:53,842 --> 00:32:57,390
I suggest you do not let
the briefcase out of five meter radius

602
00:32:57,414 --> 00:32:59,209
for more than 15 seconds.

603
00:32:59,233 --> 00:33:02,592
If you do, bracelet explodes.

604
00:33:02,616 --> 00:33:04,524
Keep it close.

605
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:10,640
It will be a shame for that beautiful face
to be disintegrated by TNT.

606
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,344
The fuck!

607
00:33:13,975 --> 00:33:16,396
I should just pop
this motherfucker right now.

608
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,781
- Address?
- Oh. The delivery address?

609
00:33:19,006 --> 00:33:20,357
In Florence.

610
00:33:20,381 --> 00:33:21,849
Ah. I love Florence.

611
00:33:21,873 --> 00:33:23,576
They adore culture.

612
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,981
You will deliver to the buyer tomorrow

613
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:27,974
at the Deludo gallery house.

614
00:33:27,998 --> 00:33:31,349
- Michael Bryce!
- You have me confused with someone else.

615
00:33:31,373 --> 00:33:35,318
No, no, no. I never forget a face of a man
who saved my life in my darkest hour.

616
00:33:35,342 --> 00:33:39,529
Michael Bryce. Didn't he lose his license
when Kurosawa was killed.

617
00:33:39,553 --> 00:33:42,257
No, no, no. He's got me mistaken
for someone else.

618
00:33:42,608 --> 00:33:44,834
And for the record,
that's pending review.

619
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:46,501
Fuck off!

620
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:53,153
Why would Carlo hire an unlicensed bodyguard
to protect the love of his life?

621
00:33:53,177 --> 00:33:55,231
Right. You're fired.

622
00:33:55,255 --> 00:33:56,919
You're fucking fired.

623
00:33:56,943 --> 00:33:59,302
Oh, that's true, baby.

624
00:33:59,326 --> 00:34:02,365
Carlo always has preferred
younger women.

625
00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:03,497
Excuse me.

626
00:34:03,521 --> 00:34:06,218
I've seen him with a woman
in her thirties.

627
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,077
But never this old.

628
00:34:08,826 --> 00:34:11,452
No, no, no, no. Don't laugh.

629
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:21,450
Here it comes.

630
00:34:21,474 --> 00:34:23,203
Oh baby. You're late.

631
00:34:23,865 --> 00:34:26,867
What the fuck did you just say?

632
00:34:27,247 --> 00:34:33,851
You finger licking, shit monkey,
doggy blowing motherfucker!

[Speaks Spanish]

634
00:34:39,623 --> 00:34:41,531
That sounded really Mexican.

635
00:34:41,787 --> 00:34:42,905
Shit!

636
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:45,154
- We have a problem.
- This is a fucking set up.

You don't fucking say, vape juice.

Get me Carlo on the phone!

00:34:50,709 --> 00:34:53,679
And here we go.

640
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,051
Shit!

641
00:35:03,846 --> 00:35:05,426
Secure the room.

642
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:08,113
Let's go. Move! Move!

643
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,340
Bryce! The gun!

644
00:35:24,828 --> 00:35:27,064
You feel like giving me a hand, Kincaid?

645
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:29,204
Triple A my ass.

646
00:35:31,883 --> 00:35:34,671
<i>Interpol agents, you are authorized,
shoot to kill.</i>

647
00:35:34,695 --> 00:35:37,632
Interpol.
<i>Get the fuck out now!</i>

648
00:35:37,656 --> 00:35:38,853
Shit!

649
00:35:44,289 --> 00:35:45,595
Bryce!

650
00:35:46,883 --> 00:35:49,790
Bryce, the case! Come on!

651
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,696
Get up! Bitch!

652
00:36:00,508 --> 00:36:01,806
Get out of the way.

653
00:36:11,906 --> 00:36:13,717
Say my age.

654
00:36:13,741 --> 00:36:15,204
I don't know.

655
00:36:18,328 --> 00:36:19,689
Bryce.

656
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:21,913
I'm famished.

657
00:36:21,937 --> 00:36:23,420
Shall we go now?

658
00:36:23,444 --> 00:36:25,056
Still Mexican.

659
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,361
Bryce!

660
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,690
Get to the fucking dock! Now!

661
00:36:39,844 --> 00:36:41,516
Bryce! Bryce!

662
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,025
Get out of the way!

663
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:53,104
Stay with me, Bryce.

664
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,047
- This way.
- Out of my fucking way! Bryce!

665
00:36:56,071 --> 00:36:57,791
Target heading for the water.

666
00:36:58,336 --> 00:36:59,994
Let's go!

667
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:13,346
You better say something nice
about my Bryce.

668
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:16,929
Ashes to ashes,

669
00:37:16,953 --> 00:37:18,580
dust to dust,

670
00:37:19,055 --> 00:37:23,604
we will never forget the time
you spent with us.

671
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,182
That was beautiful.

672
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:32,947
You should have been a priest.

673
00:37:33,274 --> 00:37:35,666
Okay, let's toss his ass in and bounce.

674
00:37:51,915 --> 00:37:55,508
What in the absolute fuck
is wrong with you people?

675
00:37:55,532 --> 00:37:57,523
We gave you a sea burial.

676
00:37:57,547 --> 00:37:58,548
A sea burial?

677
00:37:58,572 --> 00:38:00,109
Well, you didn't have a heartbeat.

678
00:38:00,133 --> 00:38:02,650
I'm wearing Kevlar!

679
00:38:03,758 --> 00:38:05,624
These were your operatives?

680
00:38:05,648 --> 00:38:06,970
I've never seen them before.

681
00:38:07,016 --> 00:38:10,436
Only one number called this phone
Michael Bryce was in possession of.

682
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,711
And it was yours.

683
00:38:11,735 --> 00:38:14,695
We have less than two days
before this attack happens, two days.

684
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:17,734
I gave you a chance.
You went behind my back.

685
00:38:17,758 --> 00:38:21,757
And you employed two criminals
and an unlicensed bodyguard

686
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:23,843
and now they are in possession
of critical evidence.

687
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:25,681
For all I know, they could be
in on the cyber attack.

688
00:38:25,705 --> 00:38:28,171
Oh, they are not in on the attacks.
Trust me, they are idiots.

689
00:38:28,195 --> 00:38:29,804
Put out a global red notice on

690
00:38:29,828 --> 00:38:32,558
Darius Kincaid, Sonia Kincaid
and Michael Bryce.

691
00:38:33,002 --> 00:38:34,777
We have a problem.

692
00:38:35,627 --> 00:38:37,199
ATHENS
GREECE

693
00:38:37,908 --> 00:38:41,423
Three unknown fugitives
escaped with the co-ordinates.

694
00:38:41,447 --> 00:38:43,658
Interpol were all over the scene.

695
00:38:43,682 --> 00:38:45,863
Seems that we have a rat.

696
00:38:45,994 --> 00:38:48,378
Get me Carlo on the phone.

697
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:50,597
Sir,

698
00:38:50,775 --> 00:38:52,589
Carlo is dead.

699
00:38:58,931 --> 00:39:02,448
Find the fugitives. Kill them.

700
00:39:02,533 --> 00:39:04,667
I need the briefcase.

701
00:39:04,853 --> 00:39:06,746
FLORENCE
ITALY

702
00:39:13,775 --> 00:39:15,322
Fuck!

703
00:39:15,346 --> 00:39:17,714
- What's wrong?
- You can't be serious.

704
00:39:17,963 --> 00:39:19,464
About what?

705
00:39:19,533 --> 00:39:20,908
My ribs are broken.

706
00:39:20,932 --> 00:39:24,168
I came down a little case
of 12 gauge shotgun to the chest.

707
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:25,470
Remember?

708
00:39:25,494 --> 00:39:29,300
Hey, Brycey, don't worry.
Sonia's gonna take care of you.

709
00:39:29,478 --> 00:39:31,462
- This will make you feel better.
- Thank you.

710
00:39:31,486 --> 00:39:33,440
There you go, baby.

711
00:39:35,024 --> 00:39:38,906
<i>The auction of artworks by the reclusive
Greek Shipping Billionaire is believed to be</i>

712
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:42,367
the last of a long line of assets he has
liquidated outside of his homeland.

713
00:39:42,391 --> 00:39:45,359
<i>It is unknown of his motivation
for selling up in Europe is</i>

714
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,383
<i>but analysts are calling it
financial suicide.</i>

715
00:39:48,407 --> 00:39:51,377
That is one hell of a security detail.

716
00:39:51,828 --> 00:39:54,616
Holy shit! Magnusson.

717
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,625
Who?

718
00:39:55,649 --> 00:39:58,594
Only the triple A rated bodyguard of the year
three years in a row.

719
00:39:58,618 --> 00:40:00,492
They give you motherfuckers awards?

720
00:40:00,516 --> 00:40:03,611
Yes, they give us awards.
And we have conventions and everything.

721
00:40:03,664 --> 00:40:05,382
Ain't no award for hitman.

722
00:40:05,406 --> 00:40:07,627
It's called lethal injection.

723
00:40:08,164 --> 00:40:10,656
God, look at him.
He's so strong.

724
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,531
Confidence like a panther.

725
00:40:12,555 --> 00:40:14,385
Let me see this motherfucker.

726
00:40:16,008 --> 00:40:17,851
Oh, shit!

727
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:22,015
Zento! That is a good
motherfucking hitman right there.

728
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:23,939
Took a lot of business from me.

729
00:40:24,203 --> 00:40:27,244
- Find yourself a nest.
- I'm gonna take the tower.

730
00:40:27,805 --> 00:40:30,238
Whoever wants this briefcase
is a serious high roller

731
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:33,916
cause Magnusson's fee is astronomical.

732
00:40:33,984 --> 00:40:37,228
Releasing the package,
I want everyone on high alert.

733
00:40:39,734 --> 00:40:41,767
And, bingo!

734
00:40:42,469 --> 00:40:43,681
Oh!

735
00:40:43,937 --> 00:40:45,791
That is awful.

736
00:40:45,929 --> 00:40:49,438
It's like Liberace
banged a set of curtains.

737
00:40:51,077 --> 00:40:55,126
Magnussen, three pigeons on the rooftop.

738
00:40:57,492 --> 00:40:59,124
They have the stolen briefcase.

739
00:40:59,148 --> 00:41:00,673
Take the shot.

740
00:41:01,508 --> 00:41:04,290
Oh shit! Zento! Gun!

741
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:07,782
- Get Aristotle to safety.
- I got him.

742
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:13,181
Scatter and converge.
Get that case.

743
00:41:17,343 --> 00:41:19,554
They won't know
we have five possible escape routes.

744
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:22,017
They have five possible escape routes.

745
00:41:26,156 --> 00:41:27,382
We should use the decoy.

746
00:41:27,406 --> 00:41:29,132
It appears they have no decoy, sir.

747
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:30,931
My god. They are amateurs.

748
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:32,658
Alright, let's go.

749
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,845
Come on!

750
00:41:42,694 --> 00:41:45,507
Listen to me,
we have an extraction vehicle waiting.

751
00:41:45,531 --> 00:41:48,048
These idiots don't even have
an extraction vehicle.

752
00:41:48,383 --> 00:41:50,447
Bryce, get up there.

753
00:41:50,586 --> 00:41:52,665
Go! Now!

754
00:41:53,976 --> 00:41:55,548
Move it! Bryce!

755
00:41:58,047 --> 00:41:59,891
Magnussen recognized me.

756
00:42:00,031 --> 00:42:01,954
Which means he probably knows my moves.

757
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:05,040
I don't recognize any of these losers.
Shoot to kill.

758
00:42:05,703 --> 00:42:08,116
- Bryce, we gotta go!
- Just a moment.

759
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,306
- Got it. Go!
- Let's go!

760
00:42:24,889 --> 00:42:28,516
Parrot is loose. Keep it inside.

761
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:31,166
Bryce, watch out!

762
00:42:37,015 --> 00:42:38,180
Wow!

763
00:42:38,204 --> 00:42:40,827
Wow! This guy's handling skills
are actually incredible.

764
00:42:40,851 --> 00:42:42,968
Steve McQueen ain't got shit on you.

765
00:42:42,992 --> 00:42:46,353
I think that's the first time
you've ever said anything nice to me.

766
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:54,529
Bryce! Bryce!

767
00:42:54,553 --> 00:42:57,306
Get down, Darius. Go! Go! Go!

768
00:42:59,185 --> 00:43:01,158
Bryce! What the fuck?

769
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,181
Move.

770
00:43:03,703 --> 00:43:04,552
Baby?

771
00:43:04,576 --> 00:43:07,179
What did you give him?

772
00:43:07,709 --> 00:43:09,929
Just painkillers.

773
00:43:10,873 --> 00:43:12,554
He's so delicate.

774
00:43:14,076 --> 00:43:16,250
Parrot is flying west, keep it inside.

775
00:43:19,686 --> 00:43:23,422
Oh no! Not the stairs, motherfucker!

776
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:30,015
I'm not wearing a sports bra!

777
00:43:38,644 --> 00:43:41,029
Jesus, these guys are little bit taken.

778
00:43:42,764 --> 00:43:45,039
This is not fucking honeymoon.

779
00:43:46,217 --> 00:43:47,942
This is shitty moon.

780
00:43:47,966 --> 00:43:49,833
I say, we had a pretty great fucking day.

781
00:43:49,857 --> 00:43:51,427
Are you fucking kidding me?

782
00:43:51,451 --> 00:43:52,624
Shopping.

783
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,989
Wine tasting.

784
00:44:00,013 --> 00:44:01,654
Yeah, with someone else's money.

785
00:44:01,678 --> 00:44:02,952
Flowers.

786
00:44:10,045 --> 00:44:11,771
One bird's still remaining in flight.

787
00:44:11,795 --> 00:44:13,145
Watching opera.

788
00:44:13,169 --> 00:44:14,803
And you fell asleep?

789
00:44:16,716 --> 00:44:18,177
Good afternoon.

790
00:44:18,201 --> 00:44:19,843
I'd like to offer up a ceasefire.

791
00:44:20,412 --> 00:44:23,325
You handover that briefcase
and I'll gladly undo that bracelet.

792
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:24,554
Sure.

793
00:44:25,154 --> 00:44:26,718
Bugger me.

794
00:44:31,107 --> 00:44:33,718
That's the end of Bryce's idol.

795
00:44:34,811 --> 00:44:36,406
Parrot's flying south.

796
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,210
Get the case.

797
00:44:41,787 --> 00:44:43,297
Shit!

798
00:44:43,897 --> 00:44:45,320
What?

799
00:44:51,326 --> 00:44:52,758
No!

800
00:45:05,576 --> 00:45:07,203
Did we lose them?

801
00:45:10,451 --> 00:45:12,359
No, you didn't lose it.

802
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,109
Oh shit!

803
00:45:26,261 --> 00:45:28,091
Oh shit!

804
00:45:30,035 --> 00:45:31,794

- No, he is--

But to me he's just papa.

895
00:50:59,009 --> 00:51:00,519
No, I'm freaked out because--

896
00:51:00,543 --> 00:51:02,749
Because his voice
is so deeply rich in its timbre?

897
00:51:02,773 --> 00:51:04,748
Yes. It's remarkable,
but a lot of people sound--

898
00:51:04,772 --> 00:51:07,405
No, motherfucker, it's not his voice,
it's the fact that he is--

899
00:51:07,429 --> 00:51:08,973
Is a published author?

900
00:51:09,568 --> 00:51:10,520
Huh?

901
00:51:10,544 --> 00:51:12,173
What is it, Darius?

902
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:16,477

905
00:51:19,227 --> 00:51:22,690
The expression is "beat around the bush."

- Interesting.
- It's "around".

your dad was black?

918

Step-dad. And I fail to see
how that's relevant.

919
00:52:03,856 --> 00:52:08,167
Why don't you start seeing with your heart
instead of your head?

920
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,349
Relevant, heart, hate?
What the fuck are you talking about?

921
00:52:11,373 --> 00:52:13,309
You know exactly

922
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:14,888

- I'm sorry, papa.

923
00:52:14,912 --> 00:52:17,419

- Understood.

925
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,187
- I can eat.
- Good. Good.

- Hungry?
- I'm a little peckish.

Nothing like taking the bullet
to make you feel like a man.

931
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,727
Yeah. Taken 20 myself.

932
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:49,387

933
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,437
Yeah?

934
00:52:51,461 --> 00:52:56,140
Yeah... for Darius. I saved his life.
Right, Darius?

935
00:52:57,432 --> 00:53:00,091
Bryce took a bullet
for my husband at the Hague.

936
00:53:00,115 --> 00:53:01,876
He was very brave.

937
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,420
Check it out. Right there.

938
00:53:06,021 --> 00:53:08,027
Why does it look like a freckle?

939
00:53:08,884 --> 00:53:11,876
He also took a shotgun blast for me,
last night.

940
00:53:12,562 --> 00:53:14,905
- Actually I was wearing Kevlar.
- Kevlar?

941
00:53:15,532 --> 00:53:17,551
Real triple A's never wear a Kevlar.

942
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:20,823
'Cause knowing Bryce and his trusty pen

943
00:53:20,847 --> 00:53:24,544
I feel half the danger is all taken care of
before it even gets to that.

944
00:53:25,959 --> 00:53:30,909
You laugh, but countless heads of state
have been taken out by the pen knife.

945
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:32,882
No one sees is coming.

946
00:53:33,822 --> 00:53:35,723
Ah, yes.

947
00:53:35,866 --> 00:53:37,902
Elena's gelato.

948
00:53:38,554 --> 00:53:40,680
Best gelato in this side...

949
00:53:44,507 --> 00:53:45,629

950
00:53:47,773 --> 00:53:49,107
Excuse me a moment.

951
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:50,619
Bryce?

952
00:53:51,263 --> 00:53:52,624
Bryce?

953
00:53:53,343 --> 00:53:54,850
What's wrong with him?

954
00:53:55,284 --> 00:53:56,951
It's the gelato.

955
00:53:58,765 --> 00:54:00,057
I forgot.

956
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:02,051
It's a trigger.

957
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:03,286
Why?

958
00:54:05,249 --> 00:54:08,281
All of Bryce's memories
are with his mother.

959
00:54:08,848 --> 00:54:12,318
She used to call him her little bodyguard.

960
00:54:12,898 --> 00:54:16,485
Every Sunday she would take Bryce
to the amusement park.

961
00:54:16,917 --> 00:54:19,565
But it wasn't the rides
he was interested in.

962
00:54:19,858 --> 00:54:22,180
It was the gelato.

963
00:54:22,528 --> 00:54:23,678
Then what happened?

964
00:54:23,757 --> 00:54:25,729
Did he choose the wrong flavor?

965
00:54:25,767 --> 00:54:29,286
No, me dear. Fate chose his mother.

966
00:54:29,784 --> 00:54:35,024
To this day I have no idea
why a full-figured 290 pound Italian man

967
00:54:35,048 --> 00:54:37,294
wanted to ride the paratrooper.

968
00:54:38,153 --> 00:54:40,285
Truth is I don't wanna know.

969
00:54:40,788 --> 00:54:42,944
Some things are best left unsaid.

970
00:54:45,836 --> 00:54:49,560
And Bryce...
Well, he chose to blame himself.

971
00:54:51,088 --> 00:54:52,993
That's why he loves seat-belts.

972
00:54:53,017 --> 00:54:56,076
Still doesn't explain
why he's so annoying.

973
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:00,222
You're annoying.

974
00:55:11,214 --> 00:55:12,985
Hey. Hi. Hi.

975
00:55:13,494 --> 00:55:15,318
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

976
00:55:15,342 --> 00:55:17,164
- Do you want me to push it?
- No. no.

977
00:55:17,276 --> 00:55:21,285
Thank you. I just...
I cry sometimes when I'm...

978
00:55:21,395 --> 00:55:22,589
awake.

979
00:55:22,864 --> 00:55:24,207
So...

980
00:55:24,231 --> 00:55:26,881
You father told us
what happened to your mother.

981
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:33,197
If I just ordered peach gelato
a minute sooner she'd still be alive.

982
00:55:33,354 --> 00:55:35,840
- It's my fault. My bad. I get.
- No. no.

983
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:39,369
It's not your fault.
You cannot blame yourself.

984
00:55:39,615 --> 00:55:42,425
When it's perfectly normal to feel guilty.

985
00:55:42,544 --> 00:55:44,957
I understand you better than you think.

986
00:55:45,677 --> 00:55:48,001
My mother was eaten by a shark.

987
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:53,446
You know seeing your mother
being devoured by a beast,

988
00:55:53,843 --> 00:55:57,150
it can really traumatize you
more than you can think.

989
00:55:57,174 --> 00:56:01,736
But my God, has he done a number on you,
honey.

990
00:56:02,105 --> 00:56:06,777
I mean you are fucked up
in more ways than I can count.

991
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:10,954
Now it all makes sense.
Including your obsession with my boobs.

992
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:14,303
What? I'm sorry, did you say
"with your boobs"? I don't...

993
00:56:14,327 --> 00:56:16,339
I've never thought about your boobs.
Not even once.

994
00:56:16,346 --> 00:56:19,674
- I didn't even know you had boobs since--
- Come on, you're obsessed with my boobs.

995
00:56:19,698 --> 00:56:20,847
OK. Jesus Christ. All right.

996
00:56:20,871 --> 00:56:26,360
When you saved me, you very gently
cupped your hands and pushed me by the boobs

997
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:27,504
to save me from the bullet.

998
00:56:27,528 --> 00:56:30,942
- It was... not a lot of alternatives...
- And I could hear the little boy

999
00:56:30,966 --> 00:56:33,347
- Didn't have much of a choice.
- inside of you screaming:

1000
00:56:33,371 --> 00:56:35,917
"Mommy, please don't die! I need you."

1001
00:56:35,941 --> 00:56:39,892
I don't think that's what I was screaming.
I don't sound like that at all.

1002
00:56:40,365 --> 00:56:42,707
- If it makes you feel any better.
- It doesn't.

1003
00:56:43,721 --> 00:56:45,747
I cannot eat gelato either.

1004
00:56:45,771 --> 00:56:47,947
Right, cause it makes me feel better.
I don't care.

1005
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:51,926
- I'm lactose intolerant.
- I still don't care. So...

1006
00:56:52,747 --> 00:56:57,037
I'm gonna head back inside.
I think they're serving shelf's tea.

1007
00:56:57,285 --> 00:57:01,665
OK. Hey, this was great.
It was really really great.

1008
00:57:02,034 --> 00:57:05,073
- To get to the safe house follow these...
- Excellent. Excellent.

1009
00:57:05,097 --> 00:57:06,534
Thank you very much.

1010
00:57:09,673 --> 00:57:11,149
Good news.

1011
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:14,182
My contact says everything is all set.

1012
00:57:14,206 --> 00:57:16,914
We'll have that TI-47
off of you in no time.

1013
00:57:16,938 --> 00:57:19,266
Meanwhile I'll sort everything out
with Interpol.

1014
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:20,444
Sonia.

1015
00:57:21,796 --> 00:57:23,793
Let's let them have a moment together.

1016
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:26,173
Bryce.

1017
00:57:28,293 --> 00:57:32,890
I'm sorry about the gelato.

1018
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,834
Hey.

1019
00:57:36,646 --> 00:57:39,738
You know, the guys who lose their license,
they never come back.

1020
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:43,136
Look at you. You gonna be a hero.

1021
00:57:44,934 --> 00:57:49,263
I'll come down to the safe house to see you
after I've got some more information.

1022
00:57:49,826 --> 00:57:52,203
I'll also have a talk
with the review board.

1023
00:57:52,364 --> 00:57:54,481
See to it that you get a good hearing.

1024
00:57:55,274 --> 00:57:56,462
Thank you.

1025
00:57:57,507 --> 00:57:59,275
- Thank you, dad.
- No worries. No worries.

1026
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:03,057
Oh, Bryce.

1027
00:58:03,792 --> 00:58:05,380
Take the Jack.

1028
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:08,413
The Jack?

1029
00:58:08,793 --> 00:58:11,016
One I wasn't even allowed
to look at it as a kid?

1030
00:58:12,611 --> 00:58:14,005
You earned it.

1031
00:58:24,185 --> 00:58:27,436
- Damn, I love this motherfuckin' car.
- Yeah!

1032
00:58:33,019 --> 00:58:36,694
Can I just acknowledge for one second
that not only are we safe.

1033
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,558
But I think I'm gonna get my license back.

1034
00:58:41,323 --> 00:58:43,408
All because of my father.

1035
00:58:44,411 --> 00:58:46,679
I'm so happy for you, Bryce.

1036
00:58:48,468 --> 00:58:49,840
Baby...

1037
00:58:52,976 --> 00:58:55,897
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

1038
00:58:58,165 --> 00:58:59,251
What?

1039
00:58:59,275 --> 00:59:02,135
I think I'm gonna join dad's agency.

1040
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:06,263
Bryce & Son. Sounds...

1041
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:09,216
a little cotton mouth.

1042
00:59:10,971 --> 00:59:13,828
You guys, you just can't keep
your hands off each other.

1043
00:59:27,357 --> 00:59:28,494
This feels familiar.

1044
00:59:28,496 --> 00:59:30,716
I don't spend that much time
with my head in the bag.

1045
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:33,318
Do you think maybe once
you could spot the ambush?

1046
00:59:33,441 --> 00:59:35,080
Watch my hair motherfucker!

1047
00:59:36,458 --> 00:59:40,676
What in the a-double-money sign is that?

1048
00:59:49,157 --> 00:59:51,640
Aristotle Papdopolous.

1049
00:59:53,977 --> 00:59:55,503
My darling.

1050
00:59:56,249 --> 00:59:58,832
I thought I had lost you forever.

1051
00:59:59,426 --> 01:00:01,754
So many sleepless nights.

1052
01:00:01,778 --> 01:00:06,270
So long have I been wandering
the maze of despair.

1053
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:10,831
Anybody wanna tell me
what the fuck's going on here?

1054
01:00:12,407 --> 01:00:13,865
Long ago...

1055
01:00:15,234 --> 01:00:21,378
a girl who had lost her way turning tricks
with wealthy men at Craps tables.

1056
01:00:22,252 --> 01:00:25,997
But when she met a mysterious Greek man

1057
01:00:26,601 --> 01:00:29,210
he taught her there was more to life.

1058
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:32,098
A life of art.

1059
01:00:32,865 --> 01:00:34,398
Literature.

1060
01:00:35,127 --> 01:00:37,443
Dance. And passion.

1061
01:00:37,743 --> 01:00:41,391
She learnt to appreciate
the finest things in life.

1062
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:44,909
But when the cheap decking
of his mega yacht

1063
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:47,354
snapped her beautiful Gucci heal

1064
01:00:48,636 --> 01:00:51,559
- Sonia!
- fate took another turn.

1065
01:00:53,131 --> 01:00:55,127
She was found by fishermen.

1066
01:00:55,256 --> 01:00:57,183
She laid in bed for weeks.

1067
01:00:57,207 --> 01:00:59,472
And when she finally woke

1068
01:00:59,588 --> 01:01:02,041
she had amnesia.

1069
01:01:03,419 --> 01:01:06,244
Now, seeing your face

1070
01:01:07,003 --> 01:01:11,270
and listening to your voice
so closely to my ear.

1071
01:01:11,492 --> 01:01:14,471
All came rushing back to me.

1072
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:16,115
You've cured me.

1073
01:01:18,546 --> 01:01:20,208
Can you put the hood back on?

1074
01:01:20,585 --> 01:01:22,638
You have history with this motherfucker?

1075
01:01:23,414 --> 01:01:27,366
If I'd known earlier
it were you who had my case

1076
01:01:27,647 --> 01:01:32,540
I would've ensured you were treated
like the Aphrodite you are.

1077
01:01:32,877 --> 01:01:34,121
Thank you.

1078
01:01:34,907 --> 01:01:40,718
Have these two brought to Lucas and Francesco
in my torture chambers.

1079
01:01:41,653 --> 01:01:43,687
- Torture chambers?
- Did he say Cha Cha chambers?

1080
01:01:43,711 --> 01:01:45,250
No, motherfucker, he did not.

1081
01:01:45,274 --> 01:01:47,920
Perhaps one day you'll learn

1082
01:01:48,049 --> 01:01:52,664
that great men don't need to strip
to vulgarity to express themselves.

1083
01:01:52,688 --> 01:01:54,524
I know how to express myself,
motherfucker.

1084
01:01:54,548 --> 01:01:55,824
- Take them away!
- Believe me.

1085
01:01:55,848 --> 01:01:59,597
- I have not begun to express myself...
- Can we have separate torture chambers?

1086
01:02:02,898 --> 01:02:06,058
The final piece of my master plan.

1087
01:02:06,373 --> 01:02:10,264
To win justice for Europe's atrocities.

1088
01:02:11,621 --> 01:02:15,868
Take her to the technology center
and have my yacht prepared.

1089
01:02:26,183 --> 01:02:27,801
Come with me.

1090
01:02:28,194 --> 01:02:30,116
I have something to show you.

1091
01:02:39,977 --> 01:02:42,799
The room we dreamt of building together.

1092
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:45,474
How nice.

1093
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:51,870
Have you ever thought
that maybe she's conning you?

1094
01:02:51,894 --> 01:02:52,979
What?

1095
01:02:53,179 --> 01:02:57,323
I'm just saying, she's a con woman.
That's what con women do.

1096
01:02:57,952 --> 01:02:59,329
Con person?

1097
01:02:59,394 --> 01:03:01,080
Person? I don't know how do you say that.

1098
01:03:01,104 --> 01:03:03,400
Could you guys come back a little bit later?
We're in the middle of a...

1099
01:03:03,424 --> 01:03:05,880
You gonna tell us everything you know.

1100
01:03:12,618 --> 01:03:14,747
I'm not telling you a motherf--

1101
01:03:19,389 --> 01:03:21,788
So you never had a family?

1102
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:24,281
You were my only true love.

1103
01:03:25,178 --> 01:03:27,186
You have suffered so much.

1104
01:03:28,851 --> 01:03:30,480
You can go all day with that.

1105
01:03:30,504 --> 01:03:34,092
You can electrocute him all day,
it will only make him angrier.

1106
01:03:37,978 --> 01:03:41,657
I, on the other hand will tell you everything.
I'll tell you everything.

1107
01:03:41,681 --> 01:03:43,535
- if you just keep that away.
- What? Really?

1108
01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:46,679
Sonia showed up, I was on vacation,
she said that Kincaid was in trouble.

1109
01:03:46,703 --> 01:03:48,478
- Motherfucker!
- And then Interpol came.

1110
01:03:48,502 --> 01:03:50,265
I don't even know
why those guys came for.

1111
01:03:50,289 --> 01:03:52,601
The guy's name was Bobby O'Neill.
Probably Robert O'Neill.

1112
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:55,395
That guy was mean.
The point is that he wanted to ask me...

1113
01:03:55,564 --> 01:03:58,964
I don't even know what a BUY is.
That's like a drug thing or something?

1114
01:04:02,629 --> 01:04:05,388
...that could be anything.
Is that Francesco or are you--

1115
01:04:10,466 --> 01:04:13,437
It is insensitive of me
to show you this.

1116
01:04:14,326 --> 01:04:16,546
Considering your condition.

1117
01:04:19,045 --> 01:04:20,288
My what?

1118
01:04:20,318 --> 01:04:23,529

1273
01:15:02,608 --> 01:15:03,901
It's OK.

1274
01:15:04,311 --> 01:15:06,523
My knees and its skin...

1275
01:15:19,821 --> 01:15:23,991
<i>So I'm gonna see my dad
and I'm really nervous.</i>

1276
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:27,866
<i>'Cause all I want in the world
is for him to be proud of me.</i>

1277
01:15:28,162 --> 01:15:31,503
<i>And I think you, future Michael
will be proud of me for dealing with this.</i>

1278
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,161
<i>I know I said a lot of things...</i>

1279
01:15:36,652 --> 01:15:40,088
Whatever the fuck
this future Michael shit is

1280
01:15:40,599 --> 01:15:41,657
it's got to go.

1281
01:15:42,474 --> 01:15:44,941
You are future Michael, motherfucker.

1282
01:15:45,758 --> 01:15:48,167
My dad called me a stain on his legacy.

1283
01:15:48,354 --> 01:15:53,225
Jesus, Bryce look, I get it.
You are a fuck up, OK?

1284
01:15:53,478 --> 01:15:55,040
You got some fucking issues.

1285
01:15:55,064 --> 01:15:56,786
But you can't allow a motherfucker

1286
01:15:56,810 --> 01:16:00,401
you share not a one drop of DNA with
to define you.

1287
01:16:07,332 --> 01:16:09,573
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

1288
01:16:09,574 --> 01:16:11,726
When I got clipped in the nuts...

1289
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:14,838
It happened in Brussels.

1290
01:16:16,287 --> 01:16:17,291
Brussels?

1291
01:16:17,375 --> 01:16:19,820
I'm Michael Bryce,
your executive protection agent.

1292
01:16:19,864 --> 01:16:21,242
Get down!

1293
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:28,443
Motherf...

1294
01:16:28,831 --> 01:16:32,567
I'm the one who shot you in the nuts
and you never thought to tell me that?

1295
01:16:32,595 --> 01:16:34,812
That's a W for me. That's a big L for you.

1296
01:16:34,838 --> 01:16:36,339
It was a ricochet.

1297
01:16:36,363 --> 01:16:38,676
- Ricochet my ass motherfucker.
- Ricochets don't count.

1298
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:40,698
It's an L for you.
Take the L! Take the L!

1299
01:16:44,021 --> 01:16:47,228
Despite the fact you get on my last nerve

1300
01:16:48,004 --> 01:16:50,017
you're pretty good fucking bodyguard.

1301
01:16:51,654 --> 01:16:53,823
I'm never getting my license back.
That's over.

1302
01:16:53,847 --> 01:16:55,141
You don't need a license.

1303
01:16:58,446 --> 01:17:00,175
What do bodyguards do?

1304
01:17:02,127 --> 01:17:03,475
They protect people.

1305
01:17:03,512 --> 01:17:07,025
And the whole of Europe
needs your protection right now.

1306
01:17:08,224 --> 01:17:09,868
Now repeat after me:

1307
01:17:10,186 --> 01:17:13,885
I'm unlicensed and I don't give a fuck.

1308
01:17:14,758 --> 01:17:17,739
I'm unlicensed and that's terrible--

1309
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:22,123
Again.

1310
01:17:23,409 --> 01:17:26,909
I'm unlicensed and I don't give a fuck.

1311
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:28,952
Louder.

1312
01:17:29,253 --> 01:17:31,325
I'm unlicensed and I don't give a fuck.

1313
01:17:31,349 --> 01:17:32,591
Robust!

1314
01:17:32,821 --> 01:17:36,683
I'm unlicensed and I don't give a fuck!

1315
01:17:36,707 --> 01:17:39,284
Now let's go do what we do
and fuck some shit up.

1316
01:17:39,308 --> 01:17:41,282
Let's go fuck some shit up.

1317
01:17:41,981 --> 01:17:43,654
- Hands in the air!
- I wasn't touching it.

1318
01:17:44,488 --> 01:17:46,257
We're telling you the truth.

1319
01:17:46,281 --> 01:17:50,279
Sonia told Kincaid that Aristotle is drilling
into the data junction at Viareggio.

1320
01:17:50,334 --> 01:17:51,983
He's gonna upload the virus in an hour.

1321
01:17:52,007 --> 01:17:54,580
Aristotle is too influential.
We'll never get a warrant in time.

1322
01:17:54,604 --> 01:17:56,417
- Let us take him down.
- Come on.

1323
01:17:57,682 --> 01:18:00,986
We just got reports of drilling
into the location in the center of Viareggio.

1324
01:18:01,017 --> 01:18:03,116
What assets do we have
on the ground in that region?

1325
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:04,852
The closest agent is Bobby O'Neill.

1326
01:18:04,876 --> 01:18:07,256
Perhaps this time
we do things the Boston way.

1327
01:18:07,264 --> 01:18:10,608
Fine. Alert all local forces
and send them to that drill.

1328
01:18:10,632 --> 01:18:13,883
We've also located his mega yacht
fleeing French national waters.

1329
01:18:14,076 --> 01:18:16,332
Don't be the government agent
in the documentary

1330
01:18:16,356 --> 01:18:19,882
who has all the info on the bad guy
then lets them go anyway. Don't be that guy.

1331
01:18:19,906 --> 01:18:21,885
- Woman.
- I think that's implied.

1332
01:18:26,321 --> 01:18:29,148
- What do you need to stop Aristotle?
- We need boats.

1333
01:18:30,185 --> 01:18:31,772
And we need guns.

1334
01:18:32,559 --> 01:18:34,536
That's my body- bodyguard!

1335
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,406
- And we need them.
- What?

1336
01:18:40,502 --> 01:18:41,772
What are your names?

1337
01:18:41,796 --> 01:18:43,402
- Gary.
- Johan.

1338
01:18:43,426 --> 01:18:45,702
Gary. Johan...

1339
01:18:46,345 --> 01:18:48,066
Are you ready to get your fuck on?

1340
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:53,657
What?

1341
01:18:53,681 --> 01:18:57,206
That came out wrong.
Not together. With us.

1342
01:18:57,461 --> 01:18:58,904
That also came out wrong.

1343
01:18:58,952 --> 01:19:01,658
You're gonna get your fuck on
in an action context.

1344
01:19:16,848 --> 01:19:20,532
We have visual of a hitman and a bodyguard
leaving port in a speed boat.

1345
01:19:20,556 --> 01:19:22,329
Deploy level 1 security.

1346
01:19:23,004 --> 01:19:24,048
Go! Go!

1347
01:19:35,134 --> 01:19:37,404
Hey, Gary, I think we're outnumbered.

1348
01:19:37,428 --> 01:19:39,471
No fucking shit, Johan!

1349
01:19:55,855 --> 01:19:57,942
God, I hope Gary and Johan are OK.

1350
01:19:57,972 --> 01:20:01,870
How the fuck can they even think that's us,
those motherfuckers didn't hit nobody?

1351
01:20:02,348 --> 01:20:04,208
Well, it's called "the decoy".

1352
01:20:04,232 --> 01:20:06,225
Darius, Body-guarding 101.

1353
01:20:06,309 --> 01:20:08,836
My dad's got 3 levels of security.
That was the first.

1354
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:11,303
- Boring.
- Oh, boring is always best.

1355
01:20:11,327 --> 01:20:14,061
- Get the fuck outta here.
- I will turn this boat around.

1356
01:20:14,195 --> 01:20:16,399
VIAREGGIO
ITALY

1357
01:20:16,608 --> 01:20:18,587
We're 30 seconds out from Viareggio.

1358
01:20:19,634 --> 01:20:20,637
Copy that.

1359
01:20:20,661 --> 01:20:21,871
If we don't stop the drill

1360
01:20:21,895 --> 01:20:24,404
they'll upload the virus
and wipe out Europe.

1361
01:20:30,959 --> 01:20:32,793
Get down! Get down! On the ground!

1362
01:20:32,896 --> 01:20:36,236
Get down! Get down!
Everybody down! Everybody down!

1363
01:20:36,714 --> 01:20:38,128
Shut up! Shut up!

1364
01:20:38,152 --> 01:20:40,723
- Stop. He says they're building pipes.
- Pipes?

1365
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,682
What kind of pipes? What kind of pipes?

1366
01:20:42,706 --> 01:20:44,628
- Wait, this isn't a data junction.
- What?

1367
01:20:44,652 --> 01:20:46,369
This is the high pressure sewage line.

1368
01:20:46,393 --> 01:20:50,002
You're telling me that we've sent
all of our resources to the wrong location?

1369
01:20:50,026 --> 01:20:53,672
The site manager here is telling me that the
type of drill that was stolen from the dock

1370
01:20:53,696 --> 01:20:55,065
is a deep sea drill.

1371
01:20:55,122 --> 01:20:57,522
They're not drilling on land,
they're drilling in the ocean.

1372
01:20:57,546 --> 01:21:01,116
It ain't Viareggio - the town.
It's Viareggio - the ocean trench.

1373
01:21:01,571 --> 01:21:03,080
And guess what's down there.

1374
01:21:03,104 --> 01:21:05,359
Europe's central data junction.

1375
01:21:05,383 --> 01:21:07,227
What? What does that mean?

1376
01:21:07,251 --> 01:21:09,664
Means the fate of Europe
is in the hands of a hitman,

1377
01:21:09,688 --> 01:21:11,486
and a bodyguard.

1378
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,799
VIAREGGIO TRENCH
EUROPE'S DATA JUNCTION

1379
01:21:17,484 --> 01:21:19,931
Deploying the drill now, sir.

1380
01:21:21,383 --> 01:21:23,401
Drill head descending.

1381
01:21:25,219 --> 01:21:26,932
One hundred meters.

1382
01:21:31,993 --> 01:21:36,330
First, you are going to watch Europe burn.

1383
01:21:36,477 --> 01:21:39,984
And then, I am going to dump you at sea.

1384
01:21:40,008 --> 01:21:41,557
But this time,

1385
01:21:41,813 --> 01:21:43,830
without the necklace.

1386
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:53,166
There is no one here.
The boat is empty.

1387
01:21:56,118 --> 01:21:57,424
Decoys.

1388
01:21:57,609 --> 01:21:58,978
Works every time.

1389
01:21:59,002 --> 01:22:01,444
Didn't you say there was
several layers of security?

1390
01:22:01,468 --> 01:22:03,571
Level two is gonna be much more...

1391
01:22:05,672 --> 01:22:08,634
<i>Attention, we have you
completely surrounded.</i>

1392
01:22:15,766 --> 01:22:17,477
Not very practical.

1393
01:22:17,501 --> 01:22:19,969
Can we just skip a couple of levels,
get to the hard shit?

1394
01:22:19,993 --> 01:22:21,190
Sure.

1395
01:22:23,836 --> 01:22:26,877
<i>Sir, we have visual of the data junction.</i>

1396
01:22:26,946 --> 01:22:29,127
You take the upper,
I'll take the lower.

1397
01:22:51,914 --> 01:22:55,062
That's funny. Your father told me
you weren't using guns.

1398
01:22:55,086 --> 01:22:56,603
Sabbatical's over.

1399
01:22:56,695 --> 01:22:59,494
Now, give me back my gun.

1400
01:22:59,809 --> 01:23:02,952
What witchcraft is that?

1401
01:23:12,012 --> 01:23:13,545
Fuck!

1402
01:23:19,763 --> 01:23:22,262
Alright. You ready for the show?

1403
01:23:22,286 --> 01:23:23,678
Huh? Huh?

1404
01:23:26,029 --> 01:23:27,311
Fuck!

1405
01:23:27,888 --> 01:23:30,413
That's OK. They can be terribly slippery.

1406
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:45,640
<i>Sir, we've made contact
with the data junction.</i>

1407
01:23:46,122 --> 01:23:48,210
<i>Initiating drill sequence.</i>

1408
01:23:51,606 --> 01:23:52,694
Take that.

1409
01:23:58,794 --> 01:24:00,021
Slice or cut?

1410
01:24:00,045 --> 01:24:01,218
Face splash.

1411
01:24:01,911 --> 01:24:02,918
Oh, shit!

1412
01:24:02,942 --> 01:24:05,410
Magnum 44 has six rounds.

1413
01:24:05,434 --> 01:24:07,279
You have only one left.

1414
01:24:08,386 --> 01:24:09,973
Fuck!

1415
01:24:10,386 --> 01:24:12,380
I can see around corners.

1416
01:24:15,089 --> 01:24:16,841
Through walls

1417
01:24:17,785 --> 01:24:19,544
and sofas.

1418
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:22,348
Even your heat signature looks old.

1419
01:24:23,964 --> 01:24:26,684
Kiss... my...

1420
01:24:43,238 --> 01:24:44,419
No?

1421
01:24:45,488 --> 01:24:47,036
No?

1422
01:24:51,230 --> 01:24:52,935
You're lucky.

1423
01:24:53,699 --> 01:24:56,466
Cause I love this song.

1424
01:25:00,839 --> 01:25:04,318
- Data junction is compromised.
- Commence upload of virus.

1425
01:25:05,464 --> 01:25:11,536
<i>Virus upload initiated.
Estimated time: six minutes.</i>

1426
01:25:13,605 --> 01:25:15,560
VIRUS UPLOADING

1427
01:25:15,636 --> 01:25:19,011
Sir, it appears that level 1
were chasing a decoy.

1428
