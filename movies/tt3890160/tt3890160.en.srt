I got a question, Doc.

487
00:24:06,585 --> 00:24:09,488
Why would I believe Phones over
here heard a goddamn word you said?

488

Baby?

490
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:22,467
The target is an armored truck

491
00:24:22,601 --> 00:24:23,878
at Perimeter Trust in Dunwoody,
10:00 a.m. sharp.

492
00:24:23,902 --> 00:24:25,336
We have
the details of the route

493
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:27,506
because someone at the depot
has a nasal problem.

494
00:24:27,639 --> 00:24:29,249
The bank itself is right
near the Buford Highway,

495
00:24:29,273 --> 00:24:30,451
so we should be able
to hit the ramp

00:24:30,475 --> 00:24:31,619
within 60 seconds
of getting out.

497

a bread truck a ways away,

502

The switch car is ready,

503
00:24:44,188 --> 00:24:45,399
but you want me to hit the
long-stay parking structure
