Michael.

3
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,600
Dear Michael. Of course it's you.
Who else could they send?
Who else could be trusted?

4
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,500
And I know it's a long way
and you're ready to go to work.

5
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,900
All I'm saying is wait, just wait, just...
Just please hear me out.

6
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,300
Because this is not an episode,
relapse, fuckup.

7
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm begging you, Michael,
I'm begging you.

8
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Try and make believe
this is not just madness...
... because this is not just madness.

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,800
Two weeks ago,
I came out of the building, okay?

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,500
I'm running across 6th Avenue,
there's a car waiting...

11
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,900
... I got exactly 38 minutes to get
to the airport, and I'm dictating.

12
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,800
There's this panicked associate
sprinting along beside me...

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,500
... scribbling in a notepad,
and she starts screaming.

14
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,700
And I realize we're standing
in the middle of the street...

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,800
... the light's changed and there's this wall
of serious traffic speeding towards us.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,100
And I freeze. I can't move.

17
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,800
I'm suddenly consumed
with the overwhelming sensation...

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
... that I'm covered
with some sort of film.

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,800
And it's in my hair, in my face.
And it's like a glaze, like a coating.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,700
And at first I thought,
"Oh, my God, I know what this is.

21
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,200
This is some sort of amniotic,
embryonic fluid.
I'm drenched in afterbirth.

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,000
I've breached the chrysalis.
I've been reborn. "

23
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,500
But then, the traffic, the stampede,
the cars, the trucks, the horns...

24
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,700
... this poor woman screaming,
and I'm thinking, "No. This is not rebirth.

25
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,800
This is some kind of giddy illusion
of renewal...

26
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,700
... that happens in
the final moment before death. "

27
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,500
And then I realize,
"No, no, no, this is completely wrong"...

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,600
... because I looked back
at the building...

29
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,700
... and I had the most stunning
moment of clarity.
I realized, Michael...

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,900
... that I had emerged, not through
the doors of Kenner, Bach & Ledeen...

31
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,300
... not through the portals
of our vast and powerful law firm...

32
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,400
... but from the asshole of an organism...

33
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,100
... whose sole function is
to excrete the poison...

34
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,700
... the ammo, the defoliant necessary
for other larger...

35
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,400
... more powerful organisms
to destroy the miracle of humanity.

36
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,400
And that I had been coated
in this patina of shit...

37
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,000
... for the best part of my life.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,800
And the stench of it, the stain of it
would take the rest of my life to undo.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,200
And you know what I did?

40
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,100
I took a deep, cleansing breath
and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.

41
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,900
I said to myself, "As clear as this may be,
as potent a feeling as this is...

42
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,100
... as true a thing as I believe
that I have witnessed today, it must wait.

43
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,700
It must stand the test of time. "

44
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,900
And, Michael, the time is now.

45
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,400
BARRY: I'm not sure what else I can tell you
that I haven't already.

46
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,500
about U/North, Barry. They're your clients.

47
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,500
So you tell me why you're settling
a six-year-old case on the fly at midnight.

48
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,400
Because I'm writing this story
whether you like it or not.

49
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,900
BARRY:
What does that exactly mean?

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,600
WOMAN:
Give me something I can print.

51

We found 97.

52
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,300
I've got that cunt from
The Wall Street Journal on my cell phone.
She will not go away.

53
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,200
Marty Bach. How can I help you?

54
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,500
WOMAN: Marty, hi. It's Bridget Klein.
We're going with a story tomorrow...

55
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,900
... about a settlement in the U/North
defoliant case. You wanna comment?

56
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,500
Case you're referring to is now,
as it has been for the past six years...

57
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,700
...pending and unresolved.

58
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,300
Till such time as our client
has their day in court...

59
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,900
...or the plaintiffs drop the suit,
I'll have nothing of value to tell you.

60
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,200
Come on, Marty, you're closing
the U/North case. You're settling.

61
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,000
I know that. I know you're up there with
600 people jamming this thing through.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,400
Here's what I know.
Your deadline was 20 minutes ago.

63
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,100
So you're fishing for a story or
trying to get out of writing a retraction.

64
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,200
In either case,
I wish you the best of luck.

65
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,200
Where the fuck is Karen Crowder?

Half the pot. Two hundred.

DEALER:
Two hundred to go.

73
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,700
You don't remember me, huh?

74
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,600
We played together a couple times.
That lamp place on Bowery.

75
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,800
That guy's showroom?
All the lamps and shit?

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
- The Galaxy.
MAN 1: That's it.

77
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,400
You had a restaurant
you were opening, right?

78
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,800
My old partner bid that job,
the plumbing.

You bought some hair too.

So, what happened with the bar?

You just had to be a rock star, huh?

Shit, man. I want to listen to Larry King,
I go home and put the fucking TV on.

That was a good location.

MAN: Michael.
- Walter.

92
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,500
Michael, thank God, there you are.
Look, I got a situation.

93
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,800
A big problem, all right? A client of mine,
he just called, he hit a guy with his car.

94
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He thinks he did. He thinks he hit him.
Just now?

95
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,100
Yeah, just now. Ten, 15 minutes ago.
He's driving home.
He's home now. He's there waiting.

96
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,400
Where?

97
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,400
Westchester. I'm down here in Bermuda.
He just got me up. I'm half asleep here.

98
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,700
Is he drunk?
No. It's the first thing I asked him.
He's good, he's sober.

99
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Tell him to stay off the phone.
All right. But you're on it?
You can get up there?

100
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,400
Because this guy, he's a huge client.
This is half my book, this guy, okay?

101
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,100
I'm walking to the car now.

102
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,600
Okay. Look, look, let me call him right back
and I'll get the address.

103
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,400
Just let me know you're on the way,
and I'll get back to you with the details.

104
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,800
All right. I'll be in the car.

105
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,300
MAN: What they did, see,
they changed the grade there.
They widened the street.

106
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,400
I'm sure somebody told them
that that was an improvement.

107
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,000
But now, you see, when it rains and when
there is fog, and with this new angle...

108
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,800
...and they've got these new...
These, uh... These, uh...

109
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,100
These sodium lamps, it's blinding.

110
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,500
- That corner there. It is just blinding.
- They'll have to work that out.

111
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,500
And it's not just tonight.
I've been saying this for years.

112
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,300
I mean, how many times have we talked
about that corner? Dell?

113
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,700
Mr. Greer, we don't have
a lot of time here.

114
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,900
So the circumstances, the road conditions,
none of this holds any interest for you?

115
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,900
What interests me is finding
the strongest criminal attorney...

116
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,100
...that can be here in 15 minutes.
Well, that sounds ominous.

117
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,800
We have some good relationships
up here in Westchester.

118
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,900
So, what are you? What are you?
You're not a lawyer?

119
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,100
- Not the kind you need.
- What kind is that?
A trial lawyer.

120
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,100
Somebody who can see this through.
That's not what I do.

121
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,800
Okay. I think we're gonna have to
pull Walter back in on this.

122
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I wanna get Walter back on the phone,
get him back into the mix.

123
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,900
Because, I'll be frank with you,
I don't like the way this is going.

124
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,700
Sir, we don't have time for Walter.
Your options are gonna get smaller quickly.

125
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,400
What options?
I'm not hearing any options!
I suggest you go local...

126
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,400
...and I'm telling you there are
people here I like for this.

127
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,900
Great. That's it?
That's what you got for me?
Hey, you believe this?

128
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,300
I have been a client at Kenner, Bach
for 12 years!

129
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,200
You think I paid that retainer every month
for a place at the back of the line?

130
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,700
Mr. Greer, you left the scene of an accident
on a slow weeknight...

131
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,100
...six miles from
the state police barracks.

132
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,500
If there's a line,
you're right up front.

133
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,500
I can get a lawyer any time I want.
I don't need you for that.

134
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,600
We're not sitting here for 45 minutes
waiting for a goddamn referral!

135
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,500
I don't know what Walter
promised you...

136
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,100
GREER: A miracle worker! That's Walter
on the phone, 20 minutes ago.

137
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,400
Direct quote, okay? "Hang tight.
I'm sending you a miracle worker."

138
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,200
- Well, he misspoke.
- About what?

139
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,600
That you're the firm's fixer?
Or that you're good at it?
Elliot.

140
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,100
The guy was running! In the street!

141
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:00,000
You take that, you add the fog,
you add the lamps, you add the angle...

142
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,900
What the fuck is he doing running in
the middle of the street at midnight, huh?!

143
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,800
You answer me that!

144
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,200
What if someone had stolen the car?

145
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,000
Huh?

146
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,700
Happens all the time.
Cops like hit-and-runs.

147
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,900
They work them hard,
they clear them fast.

148
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,300
Right now there's a B.C.I. Unit
pulling paint chips off a guard rail.

149
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,800
Tomorrow, they're gonna be looking
for the owner of a custom-painted...

150
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,200
...hand-rubbed Jaguar XJ-12.

151
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,500
And the guy you hit?
If he got a look at the plates,
it won't even take that long.

152
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,500
There's no play here.

153
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,400
There's no angle.
There's no champagne room.
I'm not a miracle worker, I'm a janitor.

154
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,800
The math on this is simple.
The smaller the mess,
the easier it is for me to clean up.

155
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,100
That's the police, isn't it?

156
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,600
No.

157
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,100
They don't call.

158
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,300
Hello.

159
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,600
Jerry, it's Michael Clayton.

160
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,400
Yeah, look, I'm sorry to wake you up.

161
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,300
No. I'm in the neighborhood.

162
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,800
You got a pen?

163
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,300
BO Y:
Mom, where's my cards?

164
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,000
Where's my cards?

165
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,100
Is my other deck in here?
Did you eat?

166
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,200
Dad's down there waiting already.
GERALD:
There were cards in our bathroom.

167
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,700
Yes, I had a waffle.
Since we're out of waffles,
I don't see how that's possible.

168
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,400
It's a miracle.

169
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,800
Gloves?

170
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,400
Henry!

171
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,500
Come on.

172
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,800
Get in.

173
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,400
Got it?

174
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,900
HENRY: So no one's even sure
exactly where they are...

175
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,200
...because there's no borders
or landmarks or anything.

176
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,300
And the town?
It's not even a town really.

177
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,600
It just is this camp where all these people
have gathered to hide.
Right.

178
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,300
All these deserters and guys
that got cut off from their armies.

179
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,600
All these people that are hiding
in the woods, trying to stay alive.

180
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,800
This is where they all came.
There's Thieves, Gray Mages,
Unbidden Warriors...

181
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
...Dark Avians,
Riverwynders and Sappers.

182
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,700
- There's, like, 15 different characters, okay?
- Okay.

183
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:57,000
And nobody has any alliances.
You can't even say who you are
because, you don't know...

184
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
...maybe the person you're talking to...

185
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,900
...maybe they're like your mortal enemy
in the wars.

186
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,200
So it's just completely like
everybody for themselves.
Sounds familiar.

187
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,300
It's really good.
I'm serious, you should really read it.

188
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,700
Right. But by the time I finish it,
you'll be on to something else.

189
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,600
- How much you wanna bet?
- I don't know. How much you got?

190
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,600
- You got your bus pass?
- It's in my locker.

191
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,700
You're not even gonna look at it,
are you?

192
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,800
- The book?
- Yes.
Bring it on Saturday, I'II...

193
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,500
I did already. I left it in your kitchen.
It's got a red cover.
Okay.

194
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,100
Well, here we go.

195
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,300
Go. Teach these people something,
would you?

196
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,700
- See you later, Dad.
- Yeah, kiddo.

197
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,100
Thanks.

198
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,100
MAN: Lot 52, lot of assorted
mixing bowls, assorted sizes.

199
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,100
Thirty dollars to start. Thirty dollars.
Thirty dollars I have.

200
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,300
You can get me to 40. I got 40. And 50.
Sixty dollars back there.

201
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,800
Sixty dollars, get me to 70.
I got 70 dollars.

202
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,500
Seventy dollars, I have now, 70.
Eighty dollars there.

203
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,000
Eighty dollars, this gentleman here.
Eighty dollars.

204
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,900
Ninety dollars there. Give me 100.
One hundred I have now.

205
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,100
He says you're still gonna be short.

206
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,700
How short?

207
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,300
Sixty. Plus the points, 75 thousand.

208
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,600
- That's liquor and everything?
- What'd you think it was gonna be?

209
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,700
I don't know. Less. Thirty. Twenty.

210
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,800
He took 1500 on a refrigerator
I paid four grand for.

211
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,600
Make a bid.

212
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:52,000
Are you telling me you don't have
the 75 thousand?
Just lying around, no.

213
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,800
We both know it's your brother
I should be talking to.
Forget that.

214
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,300
Michael, look, you wanna front this,
that's up to you.

215
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,900
But Timmy's name stays in the book
till we're clear.

216
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,500
If I know where he is,
I don't have to keep asking.

217
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:16,300
He's upstate. His wife took him back.
I don't know where he is.
He's gotta have something.

218
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,000
He's got the two kids with her.

219
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,800
He's got Jennifer, the coke-dealing waitress
that he knocked up.

220
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,700
He's got four Michelin radials
that he stole from my sister's garage.

221
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,700
Make an offer.

222
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,500
I had a wife who was a drunk.
She was a beautiful girl, young girl.

223
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,500
But live like that? Even they do a program...
She did, I think, once, two years.

224
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,000
And then they slip? Forget it.
It's like you're strapped to a bomb.

225
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,200
What's my timeframe here?

226
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,500
I don't know.

227
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,100
I didn't think it'd be a problem.

228
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,800
I'll ask.

229
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,800
MAN: Hey, Michael.
- Morning, Carl.

230
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,000
MICHAEL: I don't know. Del, I don't know
how hard you want me to press here.

231
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,700
Let me know how brave he wants to be.
how brave he can be right now.

232
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,800
We just got a confirmation hearing
scheduled.
Any chance she knows that?

233
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,600
Well, it was in the paper. Who knows?
Maybe she got someone to read it to her.

234
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,700
She called his wife yesterday.
She's calling his house.
This is a total nightmare.

235
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,200
Well, my guess is
she's gonna want the condo.
Come on, that's insane.

236
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,300
Well, what can I tell you?
Don't piss off a motivated stripper.
It's just unbelievable.

237
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,700
All right. Well, find out his pain threshold
and get back to me.

238
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,800
Or you can tell him to call me directly.

239
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,300
All right, I hear you. Let me get into it.
Okay. Thanks.

240
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,700
Hey, where are we with Marty?

241
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,600
We left word.

242
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,100
Hold on. Go back. How old is the kid?
WOMAN:
He's not a kid. He's 22.

243
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,600
- This is Miami?
- Nope. Key Biscayne.
And they charged him.

244
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,100
Reckless endangerment. My client...

245
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:33,700
I think really what they want, they want
a reality check on the attorney down there.

246
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,900
- Yeah.
- Wayne said you have some connections?

247
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,800
- Yeah, let me get a pen.
- Thank you.

248
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,400
MICHAEL: Now, if she calls the INS directly,
she's gonna get nowhere.

249
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,900
MAN 2:
Even with the appointment?

250
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,500
It's retail, Evan.
It's like the DMV over there.

251
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,000
Unless they get a call from
a district supervisor, then nobody moves.

252
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,300
But your guy can do that?
He's a former commissioner.

253
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,400
None of this comes back to me?
Because that doesn't do any good.

254
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,600
No, look, I'm gonna be
the one that's asking.

255
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,600
- Can you hang on a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

256
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,700
PAM:
Are we merging?

257
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,100
Marty Bach's in London.

258
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,200
They said he was in Atlanta,
then Lara said he was in the building.

259
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,500
So I called back.
I know you want this meeting.

260
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,900
Now she tells me the truth.
He's really in London.

261
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,600
So are we merging?
I mean, that's what everyone's saying.

262
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,900
All these Brits?
That this time it's for real.
Like I would know.

263
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,000
I don't know.

264
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,700
But even if we are, I mean, even if
they merged, it wouldn't affect us, right?

265
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,200
Your phone's ringing.

266
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,400
Evan?

267
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,000
Hey. Okay, here's what I'll do.

268
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,100
Let me give him a call
and set up a meeting for next week.

269
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:46,400
I'll walk her in,
I'll make the introduction...
U/North currently has 70,000 employees...

270
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,600
... in 62 countries around the world.

271
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,900
Around the planet.

272
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,700
Operating in 62 countries
around the planet.

273
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,500
At work in more than 60 countries
around the globe.

274
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,400
We have... We have, right now...
We have...

275
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,800
At U/North right now,
we've got 75,000 employees...

276
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,800
...in over 60 countries around the planet.

277
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,500
We are a very successful
and highly diversified company...
...so you can imagine...

278
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:25,800
...the volume and the variety
of legal issues we have to deal with is...
Overwhelming.

279
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,500
It's just enormous.

280
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,000
So you can imagine,
the volume of legal issues...

281
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,600
It's quite substantial.

282
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,300
And as general counsel, what I do...

283
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,700
...what our in-house department does...

284
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:47,100
...is to analyze the dimension
of the problem or the opportunity...

285
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,800
...to determine the jurisdiction...

286
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,000
...and to outsource our business...

287
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,700
...to those firms and talents
that we think can help us the most.

288
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,700
INTERVIEWER:
So with all that pressure and workload...

289
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,300
... how do you keep a balance
between work and life?

290
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,900
KAREN:
Balance?

291
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,700
I think that's, um...
That's something that...

292
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,200
...you search for your whole life, isn't it?

293
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,200
It's a shifting balance, really.

294
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,500
It's, you know, you, uh... You try to...

295
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,000
When you really are enjoying
what it is you do...

296
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,000
...who needs balance?

297
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,600
There's your balance.
There's your balance.

298
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,700
When you're really enjoying
what it is you do, there is your balance.

299
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,100
When Don asked me to take...

300
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,700
When Don Jeffries brought...
Don Jeffries brought me...

301
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,000
Don Jeffries brought me in here
12 years ago...

302
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,100
...trusted me, mentored me.

303
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,300
Welcomed me into the U/North family.

304
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,800
And when he moved up to the boardroom,
I never really...

305
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,100
...dreamt that I would have
the opportunity to move into his position.

306
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,000
But is it challenging? Yes.

307
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,900
And I think that it's possible that those
first few months were a little shaky.

308
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,100
But then you realize that you've been
taught to be ready, and you take the helm.

309
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,300
Because if you're not comfortable
with that level of responsibility...

310
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,300
...you're in the wrong place.

311
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,600
It's your department, your capacity to
make tough decisions in real time, and...

312
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,300
DON:
We're in the middle of an interview.
They said it was urgent.

313
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,800
Jesus.

314
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,300
Oh, for chrissake.

315
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,000
You're saying he did this in...?
Oh, my God.

316
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,800
- Barry.
- Hang on.

317
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:45,400
Arthur Edens just stripped down naked
in a deposition room in Milwaukee.

318
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,800
MAN:
Oh, Michael...

319
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,600
... I took a deep, cleansing breath
and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.

320
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,600
I said to myself, "As clear as this may be,
as potent a feeling as this is...

321
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,500
... as true a thing as I believe
that I have witnessed today, it must wait.

322
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,700
It must stand the test of time. "

323
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,600
And, Michael, the time is now.

324
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,300
This moment, today,
here, this room, this air...

325
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,900
... and this, especially this, Michael,
that you're here.

326
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,800
There's a reason.

327
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,700
A reason it's you, Michael.

328
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:24,400
Surely, you have some sense of that,
how it pulls together, how it gathers.

329
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,400
Nurse Michael, the secret hero,
the keeper of the hidden sins.

330
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,700
Tell me you can see that, Michael,
for God's sake.

331
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,000
But, I mean, yeah, yes, yes.
The nudity, the parking lot, I admit it.

332
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,900
It was... It was... It was a mistake.
It was wrong. It was lame.

333
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,100
It was obvious. And therapeutically,
it was completely useless...

334
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:47,600
...because I swear, I could stand here
and tear off my fucking skin...

335
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,800
...and I could not get down
to where this thing is living.

336
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,500
Six years, Michael.
Six years I've absorbed this poison.

337
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,900
Four hundred depositions,
a hundred motions, five changes of venue...

338
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,500
...85,000 documents in discovery.

339
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:06,000
Six years of scheming and stalling
and screaming, and what have I got?

340
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:10,500
I've spent 12 percent of my life defending
the reputation of a deadly weed killer!

341
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,800
- We had an agreement, Arthur.
- One night.

342
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,400
One night, right?
I look up and there's Marty in my office.
He's got some champagne.

343
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,500
He tells me we just hit 30,000 billable hours
on U/North and he wants to celebrate.

344
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,000
So an hour later, I find myself
in a whorehouse in Chelsea...

345
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,600
...with two Lithuanian redheads
taking turns sucking my dick.

346
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,900
I'm laying there and I'm trying not
to come and I wanna...

347
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,400
I wanna make it last,
so I start doing the math.

348
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,800
I think, "Thirty thousand hours,
what is that? That's 24 times 30.

349
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:45,000
That's 720 hours in a month,
8760 hours in a year..."

350
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,300
- Arthur.
- No, wait, wait, wait!
Because it's years! It's lives!

351
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,300
And the numbers are making me dizzy
and, you know...

352
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,600
...now, instead of trying not to come,
I'm trying not to think, and I can't stop.

353
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:03,700
I mean, is this me?
Am I this freak organism that has been
sent here to sleep and eat...

354
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,100
...and defend this one horrific chain
of carcinogenic molecules?

355
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,700
Is that my destiny? Is that my fate?
- Listen, you promised me.
- Is that it, Michael?

356
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,800
Is that my grail?
Two Lithuanian mouths on my cock?

357
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,500
Is that the correct answer
to the multiple choice of me?

358
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,900
You wanna go off your medication,
that's fine. But you call me first.

359
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,700
- That was our agreement.
- Sue me.

360
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,900
GUARD:
We okay in there?

361
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,800
We're fine. We're fine.

362
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,500
They killed them, Michael.

363
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,900
Those small farms, the family farms.

364
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,800
Did you...? Did you...?
Did you meet Anna?
No.

365
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,000
You gotta see her, you gotta talk to her.
She's a miracle, Michael.

366
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,200
She's God's perfect little creature.

367
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,800
And for 50 million dollars in fees,
I've spent 12 percent of my life...

368
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,600
...destroying perfect Anna
and her dead parents and her dying brother.

369
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,500
When did you last take one of these?

370
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,400
ARTHUR: No. I'm not losing this.
Everything is finally significant.

371
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,000
The world is a beautiful place.
I'm not trading that.

372
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,500
- Lf it's real, the pill won't kill it.
- I have blood on my hands.

373
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,300
You are senior litigating partner
of one of the largest...

374
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,200
...most respected law firms in the world.
You are a legend.

375
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:17,200
- I'm an accomplice!
- You're a manic-depressive.
I am Shiva, the god of death.

376
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,800
Let's get out of Milwaukee,
we'll talk about it.

377
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,700
We came back from the hospital
and everybody was crying...

378
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,900
... and we were in shock, but we still...
We had to milk.

379
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,500
The cows won't wait, will they?

380
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,700
No.

381
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,900
And when you went to the barn?

382
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,800
We found the note. My sister found it.

383
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,100
- From your mother?
- Yes.

384
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
MAN 1:
Could you read it for us, please?

385
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:50,000
Just read the third paragraph,
just the highlighted section there.

386
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,000
"I don't want you blaming Ned Hardy
or any of the people..."

387
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,600
ARTHUR:
Anna.

388
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,900
- Anna.
- "Down at...

389
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,700
It's all right, Anna, go on.
ARTHUR: I'm just...
- Excuse me.

390
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,000
ARTHUR: Anna, they're...
MAN 1: What's he doing?

391
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,000
Excuse me. She's a...
No, this is testimony. This is...
Excuse me, I have an objection.

392
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,600
ARTHUR: You can be a witness here.
You can be a witness.

393
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,400
MAN 1:
I am not a witness to this, sir, l...

394
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,200
ARTHUR:
Anna, I love you.

395
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:20,300
And I'm sitting here
and I'm listening to you and I swear...

396
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:25,200
... that I love you more than anything
in the world. And this is my moment.

397
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,200
This strange conference-table moment.

398
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,600
MAN 2:
Turn off that camera!

399
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,300
ARTHUR: This is my offering!
MAN 1: No, I want this on the record!

400
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,700
MAN 3:
How do I turn it off?

401
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,400
ARTHUR: This is my offering. My clothes
are my offering. This is my shame.

402
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,400
My credentials! I'm ashamed!

403
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,000
And I love you, and I swear to God...

404
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,400
I guess that's it.

405
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,100
When do we get Don?

406
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,900
She said to try back in half an hour.

407
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,500
And how about the flights?
What's the story at O'Hare?

408
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,800
- Closed four minutes ago.
- Shit.

409
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,000
There is a foot of snow
in Detroit already.
Todd, could I get that coffee now?

410
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,500
Who is this guy they sent from New York?
Clayton? I never heard of him.

411
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:35,600
Michael Raymond Clayton.
Born September 9, 1959,
St. Joseph's Hospital, Bronx, New York.

412
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,500
Father is NYPD patrolman
Raymond Xavier Clayton.

413
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,300
Mother, Alice Mary Clayton.

414
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:47,500
Graduates Washingtonville Central
High School, Orange County, New York...
... in 1977.

415
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:52,000
Graduates St. John's University, 1980.
Fordham Law, '82.

416
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:57,200
'82 through '86, he's ADA with
the Queens district attorney's office.

417
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,400
1986, he's with
the Joint Manhattan-Queens...

418
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:06,000
... Organized Crime Task Force.
And then in 1990, he starts
at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.

419
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,800
So he's a partner?

420
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,000
No. He's listed as special counsel.

421
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,900
Says he specializes in wills and trusts.

422
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,700
KAREN: He goes from criminal prosecution
to wills and trusts?

423
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,200
He's been there 17 years,
he's not a partner?

424
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,100
This is the guy they send?
Who is this guy?

425
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,600
- Hi.
- Close the door.

426
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,100
All right. So nobody, none of you,
had any idea he was coming?

427
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,500
To Milwaukee? For a deposition?

428
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:50,200
We thought there was a settlement
in the works. There's been some rumors.

429
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:55,000
Okay. Look, it's very simple.
Arthur has a chemical imbalance.

430
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,100
He's supposed to be taking his medication.
He's fallen behind on that.

431
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,700
He's back on the mend.
He'll be fine in three or four days.

432
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,100
Now, I wanna make this crystal clear.
What happened here stays in this room.

433
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,200
This is not a piece of information
you wanna be out in front of.

434
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,100
Anybody has a problem with that,
I need to know right now.

435
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,200
All right.

436
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,300
We're stuck here overnight.
I'm gonna take him
home tomorrow if I can.

437
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,400
Who's in charge of
the deposition schedule?

438
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,300
- I am.
MICHAEL: Where do we stand with that?

439
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,700
I guess it's on hold.
We didn't know what to do.

440
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,900
Nothing is on hold.
Keep doing what you were.

441
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,300
Other side wants to talk about it,
they can call New York.

442
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,600
- I need his briefcase.
- Arthur's? I don't... I didn't see it.

443
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,800
- He said it was in the room.
- It might be the stuff Jody grabbed.
Find it.

444
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,100
HENRY: So all these people,
they all start having these dreams, okay?

445
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,700
You know what a vision quest is?
You know, for, like, Navajos and stuff?

446
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,100
Yeah. I think so. Like a...

447
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,300
Like a special dream.

448
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:05,100
HENRY: Except this is like a whole bunch
of people having the same dream.

449
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,700
They're all having this dream
that they should go to this one place.

450
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,200
They don't know why or anything.
They just have this feeling
that they have to go there.

451
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,600
ARTHUR:
That they've been summoned.
That's the chapter.

452
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,200
Seriously, that's what it's called:
"Summons to Conquest."
That's the title.

453
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,000
Yeah, but do they know? Do they know
they're all having the same dream?

454
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,300
No. That's what's so cool.

455
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,600
They all think it's just them.

456
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,900
That maybe they're, like, going crazy
or something, so they don't wanna admit it.

457
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:42,800
Yeah, but they're not crazy, are they?
No. It's real. It's really happening.

458
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,700
Yeah, it is happening, isn't it?

459
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:52,500
Something larger than themselves
and they're not ready, are they...

460
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,500
...to hear it?

461
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,600
Yeah. But later they will.
So if you're gonna read it,
I don't wanna spoil it.

462
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,000
What are you doing?
Who you talking to?

463
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,100
HENRY:
I called my dad. It's a friend of his.

464
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,600
GERALD: Who?
HENRY: Mr. Edens. You don't know him.

465
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,400
- Hello? Hello?
GERALD: Henry, it's after 11.

466
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,400
HENRY:
I gotta get off now.

467
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,500
No. Wait, wait. The book.
I need the book. The title.

468
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,500
The book is Realm and Conquest.

469
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,300
ARTHUR:
Realm and Conquest.

470
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,600
- It's Book One, with the red cover.
- Henry, give me the phone.

471
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,400
I gotta go. Tell my dad I called. Okay?

472
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,600
Yeah. Yeah. Thank... Thank... Thank...
Thank you, Henry, thank you.

473
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,200
Realm and Conquest. Thank you.

474
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,100
Karen? Hi, I'm Michael Clayton.
- You're late.
- I know.

475
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,800
I'm sorry, it was more complicated
than we thought.

476
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,700
Where is he?
We've been here since 5:30.

477
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,000
- He's asleep.
- Well, wake him up.

478
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,400
That's not gonna happen.
We just got him sedated.

479
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,100
Once he gets back
on his regular medication...

480
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,100
...then it's just a matter of time.

481
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:28,800
- Have you seen the video? The tape?
- I heard about it.
What happened after is worse.

482
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,900
This is in the parking lot, okay?
People running for their cars.

483
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,100
He's there in his socks, nothing else.

484
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:39,000
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I will not sit with this sickness any longer.

485
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,900
I cannot aid this sickness any longer."

486
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,900
What does this mean?

487
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,700
I'm not sure.

488
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,500
You've been with him the whole evening.
What's he saying?

489
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,200
He wasn't really making much sense.
This is totally unacceptable.

490
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,400
This is a 3-billion-dollar
class-action lawsuit.
In the morning, I have to call my board.

491
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:02,100
I have to tell them that the architect
of our entire defense has been arrested...

492
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:06,500
...for running naked in a snowstorm,
chasing the plaintiffs through a parking lot.

493
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,400
I understand.

494
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,500
What sickness is he talking about?

495
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,800
- I don't know. It could be anything.
- Well, give me one.
Frostbite.

496
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,400
You think this is funny?
Look, his wife was sick
and she died last year.

497
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:25,000
His daughter doesn't talk to him.
He's all alone. All he does is your case.

498
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,900
He skipped his pills.
He had a bad day. That's it.

499
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,900
And you're somehow
the authority on this?

500
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,000
His last episode was eight years ago.
I was there.

501
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,000
I helped bring him home.
I watched him get better. That's it.

502
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,900
Come on, Karen, you didn't hire this guy
because of his low-key regularity...

503
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,100
...you hired him because he's a killer,
because he's brilliant...

504
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,900
...because he's crazy enough
to grind away on this case...

505
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,900
...for six years without a break.
- We pay for his time.

506
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I thought you wanted an explanation.
In the morning, I'm calling Marty Bach.

507
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,200
But, then, you know that.
Thank you, Michael.

508
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,200
He was mostly just quiet.

509
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,200
I heard him moving around,
I gave him a pill 15 minutes ago.

510
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,800
MICHAEL: He took it?
- A deal's a deal, right?
A super job, Elston.

511
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,600
You get to New York, you need tickets
to the game or anything, you let me know.

512
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,700
I'll do that for sure.

513
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,600
ARTHUR:
Did you see her?

514
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,700
- Who?
- Anna.

515
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,700
No.

516
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,500
No, I didn't see her.
She probably went back to the farm.

517
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,400
ARTHUR:
Well, we need her.

518
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,600
Marty, even then, and the rest of them,
they won't understand.

519
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,300
Well, if anybody can explain it to them,
it's you, Arthur.

520
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,100
No, they're lost.

521
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,300
- They have what they want.
- Let it go, man.

522
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,300
This what you wanted?

523
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,500
To be a janitor?

524
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,000
Live like this? All this?

525
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,400
Do what you do?

526
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,200
It can't be.

527
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,200
It's...

528
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,900
It's a burden,
that's what I'm trying to tell you.

529
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,900
That's... That's how it feels.

530
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:39,300
Well, I know that
we've been summoned.

531
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,000
Get some sleep.

532
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,900
MAN:
Hello?

533
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,800
KAREN:
Yes. Hi, I'm looking for Verne?

534
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:09,500
You have a number?
Don Jeffries gave me the number.
He said I could call at any time.

535
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,600
No. The account number.

536
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:15,900
The code? I do.
I have it right here. One moment.

537
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,800
Excuse me one moment.

538
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,900
It's right here. 12-BKR-6.

539
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,100
12-BKR-6.

540
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,600
Am I speaking with Verne?

541
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:35,500
It's Mr. Verne.
Mr. Verne. I'm sorry it's so late.

542
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,600
Don said that I could...

543
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,700
I'm not exactly sure how this works.
Do you have e-mail
at your current location?

544
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,100
I do.

545
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,500
- Are you alone?
- I am.

546
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,600
Okay, I'm gonna upload you
a little encryption package we like to use.

547
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,500
It's pretty self-explanatory.
- Okay.
- Okay.

548
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:00,500
But you have to give me a minute
to get to my desk. Hold on.
Okay. Thank you.

549
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,500
MICHAEL:
What I was wondering is...

550
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,500
...I have an option on the lease
for six more years.

551
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:36,500
I was wondering if there's any way
I could lay that off.
Is the lease worth anything?

552
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,500
Eighty-nine hundred a month. It's...

553
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,600
The fixtures are gone, but there's...

554
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:51,000
But there's the bar, there's a kitchen,
it's a great space.

555
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,700
But there's a...

556
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,100
Yeah, I understand. Mm-hm.
No, I understand.

557
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,900
Okay, yeah, I will.

558
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,300
All right. Thanks.

559
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,000
Come on, Arthur.

560
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,900
Arthur!

561
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,300
Arthur, open the door.

562
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,000
Arthur, open the door!

563
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,200
Arthur, open the goddamn door!

564
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,000
Arthur, op...!

565
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,700
Open the fucking door!

566
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,500
Arthur!

567
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,100
Goddamn it, Arthur! Open the fucking...!

568
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,600
Arthur!

569
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,700
MAN 1: Mr. Verne, hey.
MAN 2: Hey, Danny.

570
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,200
MAN 1: You guys are early.
I was pulling the other bags.

571
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,200
You can put them back.
There's been a change of plans, sorry.

572
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,300
MAN 3: We ready?
- Yep.

573
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,500
MARTY:
Oh, for chrissake.

574
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,700
Don Jeffries signed this?

575
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,700
- That's really his signature?
KAREN: Mm-hm.
Where's the original?

576
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:43,900
We had a warehouse fire five years ago.
We lost a number of documents.

577
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
What the hell is this doing
in Arthur's bag?

578
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:59,200
Well, I don't know, Marty.
That's something I was hoping
you might be able to tell me.

579
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,500
BARRY:
What are we looking for?

580
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,900
MARTY: If it says U/North, pull it aside.
Anything that says U/North.

581
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,200
What a mess this is.

582
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,200
I want all this...

583
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:23,900
...everything here, I want it all packed up
and sent up to the house.

584
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,600
Any luck, Michael?

585
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,100
He booked a limo from Newark Airport at 3,
got out at West Fourth Street...

586
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,300
...tipped the driver 100 bucks
and walked away.

587
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,000
Did you try his apartment?
- He moved.
- I know.

588
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,500
It's a loft. No doorman.
I rang, nobody answered.

589
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,300
- I called, I got the machine.
- So he could be anywhere.

590
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,500
Arthur downtown is not a good idea.
Some goddamn loft.

591
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,400
BARRY: Where's his daughter?
- I don't know. Spain, India.

592
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,700
Mars. She's crazier than he'll ever be.

593
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,700
Barry's taking over on U/North.
We got a lot of groveling to do.

594
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,400
You didn't exactly charm Karen Crowder.
I was punting.

595
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:02,500
You gotta saddle up here
and get things under control.
Saddle up?

596
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,700
He needs to be under a doctor's care.
He needs to be admitted.

597
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,200
- Where?
MARTY: Does that really matter?

598
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,300
Michael, U/North needs to know
he's under control.

599
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,800
He's in a facility. They've been shook up.
They need to be reassured.

600
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,200
- It's not gonna be that easy.
BARRY: Why the hell not?

601
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,200
Because the laws in New York are
pretty tough on involuntary commitment.

602
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:25,800
Did you see this fucking tape?
I'm not arguing with you, Barry.
I'm telling you how it is.

603
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:29,100
You know what, guys?
We got 600 lawyers in this place.

604
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,700
Why don't we find out which one knows
about psychiatric-commitment statutes?

605
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,800
I can tell you that right now. It's Arthur.

606
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,700
I'm at the door. We're good to go.

607
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,200
Yeah, roger that.
Let's keep a radio check every five, okay?

608
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,600
Every five minutes, copy that.

609
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,800
Hello, you've reached Arthur's machine.

610
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,800
If you wish to leave a message,
please do so after the tone.

611
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,500
MICHAEL:
Arthur, pick up the phone.

612
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:46,500
Arthur, pick up the phone
and talk to me.

613
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,900
No? Not gonna do it, huh?

614
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,700
What happened yesterday morning,
forget it. It doesn't matter.

615
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,600
Someday you and I
are gonna laugh about it.
But you gotta call me back.

616
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,400
You gotta call me back soon, Arthur.

617
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,500
I'll tell you what.

618
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,500
Because you said it yourself.
Part of this is definitely madness.

619
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,200
And there's a chemical part to this.
You know it and I know it.

620
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,600
But if you're willing to start with that...

621
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,900
... then I'm more than willing to
meet you halfway and say, yes...

622
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,600
...this situation sucks.
This case sucks. U/North sucks.

623
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:23,100
We can start with that.
All right, Arthur? You hear me?
You're right about what we are.

624
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,300
I'm saying you're crazy. I'm saying
that your behavior is out of control.

625
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:32,600
But I'm telling you you're right.
You called it. We're janitors, I get it.

626
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,800
But we came to this, Arthur.

627
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,600
We made decisions.
It didn't happen overnight.

628
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:45,500
You can't just suddenly stop and say,
"That's it, game over. I'm into miracles."

629
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,500
Arthur. Come on.

630
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,300
Goddamn it,
pick up the phone and talk to me.

631
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,800
Because whatever else
you think is so important...

632
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,700
...you better let me help you,
because I'm telling you straight up...

633
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:01,100
...janitor to janitor, I don't see
anybody else with a broom on the horizon.

634
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,400
It's me, buddy. I'm the...

635
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:08,500
COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Mailbox is full.
Your message cannot be recorded.

636
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,400
- Hello?
ARTHUR: Hello. Is Anna there?
Hang on.

637
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,300
Anna!

638
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,400
Where is she? Anna!

639
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,700
- Anna!
GIRL: Anna!

640
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,300
WOMAN:
Anna, you've got a phone call!

641
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,700
Where is she? Anna!

642
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,500
ANNA:
Hello?

643
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,800
Anna, hi. It's Arthur.

644
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,500
- Hey.
- Did you get some sleep?

645
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,500
I guess.

646
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:58,500
Did you think about what we said?
- Yeah.
- You didn't tell anybody, did you?

647
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:03,200
No. My sister's spying on me,
but that's normal.

648
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,000
Yeah. Because I meant what I said.

649
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,600
I know. I know. It's just...

650
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,600
...there's, like, 450 people in this lawsuit.

651
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,500
Why are you choosing me?

652
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,200
I don't know. I'm crazy, right?

653
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,000
That's for sure.

654
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,100
I mean, does it...?
Does it really matter?

655
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:28,400
I mean, isn't it what we wait for?
To meet someone? And they're...

656
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,900
They're like a lens...

657
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,700
...and suddenly you're looking
through them and everything changes...

658
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,900
...and nothing can ever be
the same again.

659
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,600
WOMAN:
Who you talking to?
It's for me, okay? I get calls too.

660
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,200
That guy?

661
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,900
Same guy. Same guy.

662
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,900
Sorry.

663
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:53,200
No. That's... That's okay.
My mother used to listen to my calls.

664
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,700
She can't believe I can do anything
on my own.
Well, that'll change.

665
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,800
ANNA:
I guess.

666
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:06,300
ARTHUR: Yeah, but, see,
that's something we can show her.
That you can do something.

667
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,600
That we could... We could do that together
if you want. I mean...

668
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,200
I mean that I can help you do that.

669
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,600
I can get you 12 by Monday.

670
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,500
Twelve's weak. Twelve looks bad.
How do you figure that?

671
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,200
They look at 75 and they look at you
and they wonder what the problem is.

672
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,500
You say 12.
That's gonna make people nervous.

673
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:30,000
This was the day before yesterday.
Let me get my ducks in order.
What's the car worth?

674
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,400
It's a lease. It's the firm's.

675
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:36,500
So? You go to the bank.
You've got the apartment. You refinance.

676
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,200
I can't. I did that three months ago.

677
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:44,900
Are you back at the tables?
Like I need that kind of action.
I don't have enough going on.

678
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,100
I hope you're kidding.

679
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:55,300
If he finds out you're playing cards with
his money, there's no dialogue after that.

680
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Do everyone a favor.

681
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,600
Get out the treasure map
and start digging.

682
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,900
You got a week.

683
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,000
WOMAN: Hey, Michael. How are you?
MICHAEL: Hi, Cindy. I'm good.

684
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,500
Come in. He's been on the phone
all morning. What else is new?

685
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,700
I am trying to get him out
in 15 minutes.

686
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,300
- Is he upstairs?
- He's taken over the living room.

687
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,300
What are you guys doing?
Get down here.

688
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:24,300
Soroyo, I told you to keep an eye on
these kids, make sure they're downstairs.

689
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,300
MICHAEL:
Marty?

690
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,700
You know what he's doing?
He's making their case.

691
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,900
I'm going through his files here,
I'm reading this...

692
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,000
...he's building a case against U/North.

693
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:54,700
- Nobody's gonna let him do that.
- Let him?
Who the hell's gonna stop him?

694
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,900
You know what I just heard?
He's calling these plaintiffs.

695
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:02,300
This woman from the deposition,
he's calling these people now.

696
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,400
He's got these discovery documents.
This is a fucking nightmare.

697
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,100
I tried him. Can't even leave a message.
He's got the machine jammed up.

698
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,800
- Is that his briefcase?
- Yeah.

699
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,200
- Why?
- We've been looking for it.

700
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,900
I don't know. It came up here
with all the other stuff from his office.

701
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:21,800
You can't believe
the crap he's got in here.

702
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,400
Listen, Marty...

703
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,200
...I'm in a bind here.

704
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,100
I need a loan. I need 80 grand.

705
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,600
- I thought you were done with that.
- It's not that.

706
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:40,400
It's not the cards. It's none of that.
It's the restaurant.
Eighty thousand.

707
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,900
I'm sorry to jump you like this.
I've been trying to get a meeting
with you for two weeks.

708
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:49,000
And I know about the merger,
whether I'm supposed to or not.

709
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,100
There's nothing final on the merger.

710
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,200
Well, that's why I'm asking you now.
You're my meal ticket.

711
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,000
Once you're out,
it's me and Barry with strangers...

712
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,100
...and I'm trying to explain what I do.

713
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,300
Everybody knows how valuable you are.
Everybody who needs to know.

714
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:07,000
I'm 45 years old and I'm broke.
I've been riding shotgun for 12 years
and I got no equity.

715
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,000
I'm sorry, I don't feel reassured.
Nobody told you to
go into the bar business.

716
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,600
I only opened it so I'd have
something else, a way out.
I had no idea you were so unhappy.

717
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,800
How many times did I ask you
to put me back on a litigation team?

718
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
- How many?
- Anybody can go to court.
You think that's special?

719
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,900
- I was good at it.
- Wonderful. So are a lot of people.

720
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:28,700
At this, what you do, you're great.

721
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:33,100
For chrissakes, you got something
everybody wants. You have a niche.

722
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,500
You made a place.
You made a niche for yourself.

723
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:40,500
And if it's nostalgia..."You should've seen
me when I was a DA back in Queens."

724
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:44,100
- Let me give you a serious piece of advice:
Leave it there.

725
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:48,700
God forbid you're not as good as
you remember. I've seen that happen too.

726
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,000
But I didn't come here for advice, did I?

727
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,600
So this is what? I give you the loan
or you don't help out with Arthur?

728
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,800
- I never said that.
- No?
Maybe you should have.

729
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,700
I don't know how you're gonna take care
of this, but this, this is cancer.

730
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,000
This is something, we don't get it
reined in and cleaned up soon...

731
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,900
...everything's vulnerable. Everything.

732
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,600
- What are you telling me?
- That I'm counting on you.

733
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,800
I'm telling you that by this time next week,
Arthur will be under control...

734
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
...and everybody who needs to will have
been reminded of your infinite value.
Jesus, Marty.

735
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,700
Hey.

736
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,400
When did you get so fucking delicate?

737
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,500
I'm late.

738
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,200
Why don't you just call Uncle Gene
and get the cops to help you?

739
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,800
It's not that kind of a problem.

740
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:19,700
HENRY: How much longer are we doing this?
- I don't know.

741
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,200
If he comes back to get his car,
you call that number and let me know.

742
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,300
- Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
- Okay. You're welcome.

743
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,900
If we're not gonna get to the movie,
why don't you just say so?

744
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,800
- What?
- I wanna go home.

745
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,800
Come on, Henry.

746
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,400
Hold up!

747
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,500
Stay in the car. Lock the door.

748
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:06,700
- Arthur! Arthur!
ARTHUR: Oh!

749
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,200
Wait up.

750
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,400
Michael. Jeez. You scared me.

751
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,600
- Making a delivery?
- No, no, no.

752
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,000
Very funny. No, nothing like that.

753
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,800
Here, take one, please. Really.
It's... It's still warm.

754
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,500
It's the best bread I ever tasted.

755
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,400
So welcome home.

756
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:35,500
Oh. I know, the hotel. I'm sorry.

757
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:38,000
I was beginning to feel
a little overwhelmed.

758
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,000
- But you're feeling better now?
- Yeah.

759
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,700
- Much better, definitely.
- Not enough to call me back.

760
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:46,100
Well, I was trying to,
um, gather my thoughts...

761
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:49,900
...before I called you,
and that's what I was doing.

762
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:54,500
And how's that going?
Yes, it's good, very good. I just...

763
00:58:54,800 --> 00:59:00,300
Well, I just need to make my thoughts
a little bit more precise. That's...

764
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,900
That's my goal.

765
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:05,300
As good as this feels,
you know where it goes.

766
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:10,100
No. No. You're wrong.
What makes this feel good
is that I don't know where it goes.

767
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:14,400
How do I talk to you, Arthur?
So you hear me?

768
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:19,100
Like a child? Like a nut?
Like everything's fine?

769
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:23,100
What's the secret?
Because I need you to hear me.

770
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,200
- Well, I hear everything.
- Then hear this.

771
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,400
You need help.
Before this goes too far, you need help.

772
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,800
You got great cards here.

773
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,300
If you keep your clothes on, you can
do any goddamn thing you want.

774
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:38,700
You want out, you're out.
You wanna bake bread, go with God.

775
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,600
There's only one wrong answer
in this whole goddamn pile...

776
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,500
...and you've got
your arms around it.

777
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:47,000
- Well, I said I was sorry.
- You thought the hotel was overwhelming?

778
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,700
You piss on this case,
they'll cut you off at the knees.

779
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:53,200
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm covering for you.

780
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:56,800
I'm telling them everything's fine.
You're fine. Everybody's cool.

781
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,200
I'm out running this "price of genius" story
to anybody who'll listen.

782
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,600
And then I wake up this morning and I hear
you're calling this girl from Wisconsin...

783
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,700
...messing with documents
and whatever else.

784
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,400
- How can you know that?
- They're gonna take everything.

785
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:13,000
Your partnership, your equity.
They're gonna pull your license.

786
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,400
- How do you know I called Anna?
- Marty told me.

787
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:19,500
- Well, how does he know?
- I don't know. I don't give a shit!

788
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
- You're tapping my phone.
- Jesus, Arthur.

789
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:27,000
Then explain it.
Tell me how Marty knows!

790
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:32,000
Because you're chasing a girl through
a parking lot with your dick hanging out.

791
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,000
You think she didn't get off the phone
and dial her attorney?

792
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,100
No. She wouldn't do that. I know that.

793
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:41,200
Really? You think your judgment
is state-of-the-art right now?

794
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:46,000
They're putting everything on the table.
You need to stop and think this through.

795
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:50,100
I'll help you think this through.
I'll find somebody to help you
think it through.

796
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:54,500
Don't do this.
You're making it easy for them.

797
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:59,300
Michael, I have great affection for you.

798
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:04,300
You lead a very rich and interesting life,
but you're a bagman, not an attorney.

799
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,200
If you wanted to have me committed...

800
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,200
...you should have kept me in Wisconsin,
where the arrest report, the videotape...

801
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,100
...and eyewitness accounts
of my inappropriate behavior...

802
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,200
...would have had
jurisdictional relevance.

803
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,800
I have no criminal record
in the state of New York.

804
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:23,500
And the single determining criterion
for involuntary incarceration is danger.

805
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:27,000
Is the defendant a danger
to himself or others?

806
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,900
You think you got the horses for that?

807
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:33,400
Well, good luck and God bless.
But I tell you this:

808
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:38,200
The last place you want to see me
is in court.

809
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,900
I'm not the enemy.

810
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,400
Then who are you?

811
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:58,200
NARRATOR:
We find the seed.

812
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,100
We shape the soil.

813
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,100
We speed the harvest.

814
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,200
We feed the planet.

815
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,700
We find the seed.

816
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,700
We shape the soil.

817
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,900
We speed the harvest.

818
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,800
We feed the planet.

819
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,700
What the hell is he doing?

820
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,700
We find the seed.

821
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:26,000
WOMAN: You've reached the voicemail of
Arthur Edens at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.

822
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:30,000
Please leave your message
after the tone.
Yes!

823
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:34,200
Here we are, all together.
Is everyone listening?

824
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,800
This is the moment you've been waiting for.
A very special piece of paper.

825
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,500
So let's have a big, paranoid,
malignant round of applause...

826
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:47,000
... for United Northfield Culcitate
Internal Research Memorandum 229.

827
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:50,400
June 19th, 1991.

828
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,300
"Conclusion:

829
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,100
The unanticipated market growth
for Culcitate...

830
01:03:55,300 --> 01:04:00,500
...by small farms in colder climates
demands immediate cost-benefit analysis."

831
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:04,600
Would you guys like
a little bit of legal advice?

832
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:07,400
Never let a scientist
use the words "unanticipated"...

833
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:10,700
...and "immediate"
in the same sentence.

834
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,700
Okay? Okay.

835
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:15,300
"In-house field studies
have indicated...

836
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:20,400
... that small short-season farms dependent
on well water for human consumption...

837
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,500
... are at risk for toxic
particulate concentrations at levels...

838
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:28,600
...significant enough to cause
serious human tissue damage."

839
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,200
Well, this is a long way of saying that...

840
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,700
...you don't even have to leave your house
to be killed by our product.

841
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,500
We'll pipe it into your kitchen sink.

842
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:40,200
- "Culcitate's great market advantage...
- Give me the phone.

843
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,300
... that it is tasteless, colorless
and does not precipitate...

844
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:48,900
... has the potential
to mask and intensify...
...these potentially lethal exposures."

845
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,800
Now, I love this.

846
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:56,800
Not only is this a great product...
...it is a superb cancer delivery system.

847
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:59,700
"Chemical modifications
of the Culcitate product...

848
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:04,000
... the addition of a detector molecule,
such as an odorant or colorant...

849
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:09,100
... would require a top-down redesign
of the Culcitate manufacturing process.

850
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:12,400
These costs,
while assumed to be significant...

851
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:16,400
... were not summarized here. "
Which, loosely translated, means:

852
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:20,700
"It's going to cost a fortune to go back
on this, and I'm just an asshole in a lab...

853
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:24,100
...so could someone else
please make the decision?"

854
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:27,800
"Clearly, the release of
these internal research documents...

855
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,700
... would compromise
the effective marketing of Culcitate...

856
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,600
...and must be kept within
the protective confines...

857
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:37,900
...of United-Northfield's
trade secret language."

858
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:43,700
You don't need me
to tell you what that means.

859
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,300
Goodbye.

860
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
- It seemed to warrant my coming to...
- Yes.

861
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,400
You have to contain this.

862
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:59,000
- Contain?
- Right.

863
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,600
Well, that's my question.

864
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:06,700
What are the?
What's the option that we're looking at?

865
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,700
Along those lines.

866
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:12,200
You're talking about the paper, the data?
I don't...

867
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:17,200
Well, I'm wondering
if there is some other option.

868
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,000
I mean something I'm not thinking of?

869
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
We deal in absolutes.

870
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:25,000
Okay. I understand that. I do.

871
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:30,600
The material, the papers, I'm not a lawyer.
We try, we do what we can.

872
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,600
Well, the other way?

873
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,500
Is the other way.

874
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,900
- Maybe you wanna bring Don in on this.
- No.

875
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:47,700
This has nothing to do with Don. He's busy.
This has nothing to do with Don.

876
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,600
Do you think it's doable?

877
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:00,200
Yeah. We have some good ideas.
You say move, we move.

878
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:04,900
If the ideas don't look so good,
we back off, reassess...
Okay.

879
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:12,400
Is that, "Okay, you understand,"
or "Okay, proceed"?

880
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:18,900
PEOPLE:
Are you 1? Are you 2? Are you 3?

881
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:22,200
Are you 4? Are you 5? Are you 6?

882
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:27,200
- Are you 7? Are you 8? Are you 9?
MAN: Come on.
Come, come on. Come on, I said. Hey!

883
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:30,000
Come on.

884
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:33,900
STEPHANIE:
Go on, Dad, make a wish.
If I get what I wish for, it'll kill me.

885
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:37,400
GENE:
You're a maniac. Unbelievable.

886
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,600
Give me a hand, Eddie, huh?

887
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,800
All right, Eddie.

888
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:47,200
STEPHANIE: Now, I did not make this myself
and I don't wanna hear any complaints.

889
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,900
Happy birthday.

890
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,900
You have time for cake?

891
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,700
Yeah, yeah. I'll take one to go.

892
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,300
- You going in?
- Mm-hm.

893
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,600
- I'm late already.
- Shit.

894
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:02,100
You're not both running out?
I got a situation.

895
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,000
- You can't hang?
- You're going in.

896
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:06,500
- Yeah. I got a shift.
- So do I.

897
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:09,600
Come on, man.
You haven't been up here in months.

898
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:15,300
If you go back now, Mickey,
Henry's staying here.
Good. You can drive him home.

899
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:19,200
GENE:
Just stay for an hour.
The girls did all this stuff.

900
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,100
He'll be asleep by then.

901
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,500
Timmy's been calling me.

902
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:34,300
He's afraid to talk to you.
He should be.

903
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:39,200
- It closed out bad, right?
- Is that what he told you?
The kids are freaking out.

904
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,800
The in-laws are freaking out.

905
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,100
Pammy can't stop crying long enough
to start freaking out.

906
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:48,900
- She took him back.
- So what? Fuck her and the kids?

907
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,700
No. Fuck Timmy.
And nothing's closed, okay?

908
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:55,600
I sold everything and we're still short.
So don't talk about Pammy and the kids.

909
01:08:55,700 --> 01:09:00,700
I got my hands full.
If it was you, he'd be in traction.

910
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,100
Yeah, he's sick, all right?

911
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:08,400
- He's sick. It's a sickness.
- There's a fresh perspective.

912
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:13,100
I've seen a lot of people falling off
the wagon lately. It's going around.

913
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,800
Is that pointed at me?

914
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:23,200
When do I see you?
How do I know what you're up to?
I haven't bet on a game in over a year.

915
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:25,800
I haven't been in a card room
in 10 months.

916
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,800
I gambled on the bar.
I bet on Timmy and he wiped me out.
That was my big play, all right?

917
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,800
I put up my walk-away money
and it's gone and I'm scrambling.

918
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,600
Okay. Okay.

919
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,600
Cool down. I hear you.

920
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,600
I'd be pissed off too.

921
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,700
Just hang for an hour.

922
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,400
- Okay?
- Yeah.

923
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,200
Ready? And, lift.

924
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,700
Ready and go.

925
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:02,700
Wipe.

926
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,800
You better hit it.

927
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,800
We're good.

928
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,900
[ANNOUNCER
SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON TV]

929
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:26,200
Okay, I found it. That's his number.

930
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:30,500
Dr. Mullien.
See if you have any more luck.
If I can. As soon as I get a chance.

931
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:33,800
It's Medicaid. They're running us in circles.
I can pull the file...

932
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,300
Let him go, Steph. He's got a date.
I've got a date with a maniac attorney.

933
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,000
- Take a night off, Mickey.
- You look tired.

934
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:43,200
MICHAEL: I'm okay. See you soon.
- Be good.

935
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,600
- All right. Bye.
- Bye, Hen.

936
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,800
MICHAEL: Bye, Pop.
- Bye.

937
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:01,400
- Uncle Timmy, hey!
- How you doing, Henry?
Henry, get in the car.

938
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:05,900
Good to see you, Hen.

939
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,800
- What do you want?
- I've been sober eight days now.

940
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:14,800
Been back at the meetings.
I wanted you to know.

941
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,800
In front of the kid?

942
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,300
Mickey, please.
I know how bad I did, I swear.

943
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:25,300
I don't know how to make it right again.
It's all I think about.

944
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:28,100
What do I do? I don't know what to do.

945
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,400
Get Stephanie her tires back.

946
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,600
- Is he crying?
- I don't know.

947
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,800
Because of drugs, right?

948
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,800
That and everything else.

949
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,400
What?

950
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,400
Your Uncle Timmy...

951
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:26,200
...and I mean this, on his best day,
is never as tough as you.

952
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:30,400
I'm not talking about crying
or the drugs or anything.

953
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:34,600
I'm talking about in his heart, in his heart.
You understand me?

954
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:38,600
And all his charming bullshit,
this Big Tim, Uncle, Boss bullshit...

955
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:43,000
...and I know you love him,
and I know why.
But when you see him like that...

956
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:45,900
...you don't have to worry.
That's not how it'll be for you.

957
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:48,600
You're not gonna be someone
that goes through life...

958
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:55,000
...wondering why shit keeps
falling out of the sky around them.
I know that. I know it.

959
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:56,400
Okay?

960
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:04,800
I see it every time I look at you.
I see it right now.

961
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:10,500
I don't know where you got it from,
but you got it.

962
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:12,900
Okay?

963
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:27,400
Hello?

964
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:41,400
The neighbors came by.
They're renovating the loft downstairs.

965
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:46,200
They had water flooding from
his bathroom down to their place.

966
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:51,800
His front door, fire escape,
he had everything locked up pretty good.

967
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,300
It took our guys 10 minutes.
They had to knock the thing down.

968
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:00,200
There's pills all over the place.

969
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,100
Just the scene alone is
pretty definitive for suicide.

970
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,200
Then I spoke to some of your partners...

971
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:13,200
...who ran down these problems
he'd been having lately, so...

972
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:18,500
- Is there a note?
- No. They looked.

973
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:23,600
It could be an accident or he was gonna
write a note and just messed up.

974
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:29,200
Can I get in there?
His place? Not now. It's sealed.

975
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:34,100
Once the seal goes up, it's frozen.
We're gonna try and reach his daughter.

976
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:37,600
I guess she's off in Europe.
But she's gotta come in.

977
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,100
Or the M.E.'s gotta come back
with a toxicology report.

978
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:45,300
That's a couple of weeks at least
that it's gotta stay like that.

979
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,800
Sorry.

980
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,300
Sure.

981
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:57,500
Okay.

982
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:06,400
I know your brother a little.
My wife works the 190 out in Queens.

983
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,400
I'll tell him hello.
If something comes in,
I'll get back to you.

984
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:15,600
Yeah. I appreciate it.
I'm sorry for your loss.

985
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:36,700
- Michael.
- Jeff.

986
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,300
This is tough.

987
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,500
Yeah, it is. He in here?

988
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,800
Dumb son of a bitch.

989
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:57,900
What a thing.
BARRY: Hold on.
- I don't even know...

990
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,300
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah. All right.
I didn't even get a chance to talk to him.

991
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:07,000
That crazy goddamn bastard.

992
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:10,500
What a waste.
What the hell was he thinking?

993
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,700
Marty? I gotta set this up.
Go. Go.

994
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,800
You okay?

995
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,300
Yeah, I'm fine.

996
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,900
Come on, let's get you a drink.

997
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:29,700
I just keep replaying all this back.
Like, did I push him too hard?

998
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:31,300
Not a chance.

999
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:33,100
I just couldn't get through to him.

1000
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:36,900
What, you scared him to death?
Come on. The man was a bull.

1001
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:40,500
- Never happened.
- Why does he fold, then? Why does he?

1002
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:44,600
It's gotta be an accident.

1003
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,100
No, no. Arthur without a note?

1004
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:49,300
He couldn't piss without leaving a memo.
Has to be an accident.

1005
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,700
I don't get that.
I don't understand that either.

1006
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:54,100
One minute he's gonna
take on the whole world...

1007
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:58,900
...and then 12 hours later,
he's sucking down pills. Why?
Why?

1008
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:04,800
Because people are
fucking incomprehensible. "Why?"

1009
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:10,900
Thirty years I know Arthur.

1010
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:13,000
Good years.

1011
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:18,700
And what I feel right now, if I'm honest?

1012
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:24,000
I can't even say, it's so awful.

1013
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,800
You can say it.

1014
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,400
We caught a lucky break.

1015
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:36,600
We did, didn't we?

1016
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:44,700
Marty? We need to get up to the office.

1017
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:46,600
MARTY: They accepted?
BARRY: In principle.

1018
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,600
Don Jeffries wants us
on the phone in half an hour.

1019
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:52,700
I tried to explain about Arthur,
but they're short on sympathy.

1020
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:54,800
Wait a minute. U/North is settling?

1021
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:59,700
BARRY: They see a window. They wanna try.
It's their show. What are we gonna do?

1022
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,900
You did what you could, Michael.
We all did.

1023
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:06,600
It's...

1024
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,500
It's what we got.

1025
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,500
- You need a ride?
- No, thanks, I'm fine.

1026
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:46,300
Hello.

1027
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,200
Hello. Hi. I'm looking for Anna Kysersun.

1028
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:50,300
WOMAN:
Who is this?

1029
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,900
Michael Clayton. I'm an attorney in
New York. I got your number from Arthur.

1030
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:57,000
- You have got some nerve.
- Excuse me?

1031
01:20:57,100 --> 01:21:00,900
You get her all the way to New York City
and then leave her at the airport?

1032
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:05,900
This is not a complicated person.
This is a girl who's never been
farther than Milwaukee.

1033
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:08,100
- Wait a minute. Now, wait.
- No, you wait.

1034
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:12,600
She's coming home tomorrow
and when she does, if you call here again...

1035
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:17,400
Are you telling me she's
in New York right now?
This is a young girl, do you hear me?

1036
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,200
MICHAEL:
She's in the city right now?

1037
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,800
What kind of people are you?

1038
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,100
MICHAEL: Listen. You just stay
on the phone one second. One second.

1039
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,600
MICHAEL:
Anna.

1040
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:02,800
Anna?

1041
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,600
My name's Michael Clayton.
I'm a friend of Arthur's.

1042
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:10,200
I spoke with your sister.
She told me you were here.

1043
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:12,800
Please open the door, Anna.

1044
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:25,800
What are you thinking?

1045
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:31,700
I don't know. I'll watch the door.
You check his car. Let's get some details.

1046
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,800
He didn't want to say
exactly what it was.

1047
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:43,500
Just that when I got here,
he would pick me up...

1048
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:46,200
...and show me, and I would see...

1049
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,500
...that it was something
that would win the whole case.

1050
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:55,000
Even this morning...

1051
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,000
...I mean, I thought:

1052
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:03,000
"Okay, if I get to the airport
and the ticket's not there, then I'll know.

1053
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:08,200
Okay, you're stupid,
and you can go home now."

1054
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:15,700
But it was there and he paid
like 800 dollars...

1055
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,500
...for a first-class ticket.

1056
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:20,100
And I just...

1057
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:26,000
I got on the plane.

1058
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,700
I believed him.

1059
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:40,200
You think maybe he was
in some way disappointed?

1060
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Let's say that he knew that you
told somebody else about all of this...

1061
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:49,400
...and, I don't know, in some crazy way,
he was disappointed by that?

1062
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:54,300
- But I didn't.
- You must have told somebody else.
No.

1063
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,700
He made me promise.

1064
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:03,600
You didn't tell anybody else about this?
Not one other person?

1065
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:06,100
No.

1066
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:13,800
He really was crazy, wasn't he?

1067
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:29,400
- You talking about this?
- Let me see.

1068
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:33,300
- You know what that is?
- Yeah.

1069
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:36,600
You said a favor.
That's more than a favor.

1070
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,800
Well, nobody's gonna know
where it came from.

1071
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:42,700
- Are you that jammed up?
- What are you talking about?

1072
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:45,500
Who asked for this?
It's the restaurant, right?

1073
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:50,000
One of these guys you owe?
"Get me a seal."
You really wanna know?

1074
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:09,700
This just gets better and better.

1075
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,900
What are we doing?

1076
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:18,400
MAN:
Freeze!
Right there, asshole! Don't move!

1077
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:23,500
- It's all right, I'm a friend!
- Get your hands up!
Get your hands up now! Now!

1078
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:28,700
- What's in your hand?
- It's a book.
Drop it! Drop it, now! Drop it!

1079
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:32,100
WOMAN: Turn around. Slowly.
- All right. All right. Okay.

1080
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:34,100
WOMAN: Who else is here?
MICHAEL: Nobody.

1081
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:38,300
WOMAN: I said, who else is here?
MICHAEL: Nobody's here!
Check in there.

1082
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:42,400
You move, I'll take your head off.

1083
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:16,700
Now I owe this scumbag and his wife...
Who's a complete piece of shit in my unit.

1084
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:19,000
- Now I owe them both my balls.
MICHAEL: I'm sorry.

1085
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:21,100
- You know I am.
- "Nobody will know it's me."

1086
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:25,900
You know what happens they don't
bury this, that I gave you this?
It's bad. I know it.

1087
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:29,100
I'm 18 months away from my 20.
You just put my pension in jeopardy.

1088
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:31,300
- You made your point.
- It's not a point!

1089
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:33,800
- Who called 911?
- What?

1090
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:37,100
The building was empty. I was quiet.
I wasn't there very long.

1091
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:41,400
Who called it in?
Does that make sense to you...?
This never happened.

1092
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:44,700
You got these cops thinking
you're a lawyer.

1093
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:47,000
You got these lawyers thinking
you're a cop.

1094
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:51,300
You got everybody fooled, don't you?
Everybody but you.

1095
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:53,700
You know exactly what you are.

1096
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:11,000
We tried calling you six times.
But your machine must be
busted or something.

1097
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,800
We gave it our best shot.

1098
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:18,200
We ran out of red covers.
We only had 2000 in stock...

1099
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:21,100
...so we did the other thousand in blue.

1100
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:44,500
Is everything all right?
It's fine, yeah.

1101
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:48,300
You have a van or something?
Because I have 25 boxes back there...

1102
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:51,500
Do me a favor. Hang on to them.

1103
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:53,900
I'll come back and pick everything up
next week.

1104
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:56,500
- Seriously? Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

1105
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:18,100
Hello.

1106
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:26,600
Don. You go ahead. I'll catch up to you.

1107
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:28,400
What?

1108
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:38,000
VERNE:
Do you know Michael Clayton?

1109
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:39,800
KAREN:
Yeah, why?

1110
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:41,600
We have a situation.

1111
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:06,200
Hey, did they find you?
- Who?
- Marty. I don't think they've gone in yet.

1112
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:15,700
Marty.

1113
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,200
Your phone's off. There's too much
going on for your phone to be off.

1114
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:23,200
- I need a minute.
- Yeah, well, we're late...
We never got to finish last night.

1115
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:25,500
Did you close the place?
You look like hell.

1116
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:28,700
- No, I left right after you left.
- Lf you say so.

1117
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:31,600
We've been here all night.
We had to make an announcement.

1118
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:35,000
Jean! I need the thing, the envelope.

1119
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,400
I wanted your input. I couldn't get you.
I had to pull the trigger.

1120
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:41,500
I put Bob Nast and Kim,
probably a mistake.

1121
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:45,000
They're gonna pull together a memorial
service by the end of the week.

1122
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:47,400
I told them to call you
if they need any help.

1123
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,800
No, no, no.
The other one. The other one.

1124
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:53,800
So we cut you a check this morning.

1125
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:57,100
There's some strings attached.
And Barry...

1126
01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:01,400
There's no way around this,
Barry's gonna have to be involved.

1127
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:07,600
What if Arthur was on to something?

1128
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:12,400
What do you mean? On to what?
U/North. What if he wasn't crazy?
What if he was right?

1129
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,800
Right about what?
That we're on the wrong side?

1130
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:17,400
Wrong side, wrong way,
everything, all of it.

1131
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:20,500
This is news?
This case reeked from day one.

1132
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:22,600
I gotta tell you how we pay the rent?

1133
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,500
What would they do?
What would they do if he went public?

1134
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:29,100
What would they do? Are you fucking soft?
They're doing it.

1135
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:31,700
We don't straighten the settlement out
in 24 hours...

1136
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:34,000
...they're gonna withhold
$9 million in fees.

1137
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:37,100
Then they'll pull out the video of Arthur
doing his flashdance.

1138
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:39,000
They'll sue us for legal malpractice.

1139
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:42,800
Except there won't be anything to win
because the London merger will be dead...

1140
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,800
...and we'll be selling off
the goddamn furniture.
That's 80.

1141
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:50,300
We're calling it a bonus.

1142
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Three-year contract
at your current numbers.

1143
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:56,100
That's assuming this all works out.
You're doing this now?

1144
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:01,200
Look, I agreed to this, okay?
But there's rules now.

1145
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:04,200
You want the contract,
you sign a confidentiality agreement.

1146
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:08,400
It's gonna be bulletproof
and retroactive.
Because Marty's too nice to say it...

1147
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:12,300
...but with all you know about this place,
the clients and people who work here...

1148
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:15,100
...it makes it a little weird
when you ask for 80 grand.

1149
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:18,400
If I was gonna shake anybody down,
I'd come to you...

1150
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:21,300
...and it wouldn't be for 80 grand.
Is this him or you?

1151
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:25,400
- Lf I'm wrong, I apologize.
- You're way the fuck wrong.
So there you go.

1152
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,600
Enough. Okay? Everybody.

1153
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:30,600
He's an asshole, but he knows it.

1154
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:34,000
And you're on the record.
Okay? Everybody happy?

1155
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:37,700
JEAN: Don Jeffries is here.
- We're on the way.

1156
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:42,200
Call Bob Nast.
Just see if they need help with this thing.

1157
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,300
You're welcome.

1158
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:42,400
You said 12. This is 75.

1159
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:46,800
Well, don't get too excited.
You want a drink?
No. I'm working.

1160
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:52,800
So we're square, then. No bad blood.

1161
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:56,300
You're just doing your job.
That's right.

1162
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:58,900
Take it easy, Gabe.

1163
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:01,300
Michael.

1164
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:14,500
MAN 1:
Check.

1165
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:17,800
MICHAEL:
Check.

1166
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:20,800
- Check.
MAN 2: Half the pot. Two hundred.

1167
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,500
Two hundred to go.

1168
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:03,500
So, what happened with the bar?
You just had to be a rock star, huh?

1169
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,700
What are you doing? You just got here.

1170
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:35,200
Guy plays nine hands, walks away.
I scare you away? What did I do?
Did I scare you away?

1171
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:12,100
Get out.

1172
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:15,500
Get out of the car now.

1173
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:18,200
- Walter?
MAN: Michael.

1174
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:21,300
- Michael. Thank God you're there.
- Yeah.

1175
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
You have eight...

1176
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:30,600
... six, five...

1177
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:33,100
... four, three...

1178
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:35,000
Get out of the car.

1179
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:43,400
MICHAEL: Tell him to stay off the phone.
MAN: All right. But you're on it?
Am I clean?

1180
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:47,200
Just keep walking.
You copy. Am I clean?

1181
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:50,400
Just keep moving.
He's walking to the car.

1182
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:54,500
MAN: ... to let him know you're on the way.
I'll get back to you with the details.

1183
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:57,900
- Just give me two minutes.
- I'll be in the car.

1184
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:04,300
IKER:
I didn't finish. It's in, but I don't know.

1185
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:36,100
It's loose. I got a pulse.
He's up there somewhere, but...

1186
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:40,400
Let's find a way to boost the signal.

1187
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:49,200
MICHAEL:
I don't know what Walter promised you...

1188
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:50,500
GREER:
A miracle worker!

1189
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:53,900
That's Walter on the phone,
20 minutes ago. Direct quote, okay?

1190
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,700
"I'm sending you a miracle worker."
- Well, he misspoke.
- About what?

1191
01:39:57,900 --> 01:40:02,400
About the fact that you're the firm's fixer?
Or that you're any good at it?

1192
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:09,400
We're up. Just got a signal.

1193
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,300
VERNE: There's nothing back this way.
What's he doing?

1194
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:36,700
IKER:
Maybe he's lost.

1195
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:39,600
VERNE: Wait a minute.
IKER: That's him.

1196
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,200
He was alone, right?
- Yeah, I think so.
- Call it, yes or no?

1197
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:50,500
We gotta turn around.

1198
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,200
Talk to me.

1199
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:23,900
It's strobing.

1200
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:27,500
No, we're good. I think we're good.
Just keep going.

1201
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:45,400
No, he turned. Somehow he turned.
- Where?
- He took...

1202
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:48,700
- He took a left.
- I don't have a left.

1203
01:41:57,900 --> 01:42:00,800
- East. He's southeast.
- What, so we missed it?

1204
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,500
- Or the grid is wrong.
- Hang on.

1205
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:16,000
- We gotta go back to one.
- One is what? Where's our one?

1206
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:19,700
Half a mile straight ahead.
Just keep driving. Just go.

1207
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:29,900
It says we're closing.
But that's west. It can't be west.
The signal or the grid?

1208
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:33,600
- It's both. It just keeps dropping out.
- Goddamn it.

1209
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:25,700
Give me the cell.

1210
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:29,800
Our signal's good.

1211
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:08,900
What?

1212
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:13,300
Thanks, Mickey.

1213
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:15,400
Just get me out of here.

1214
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:26,500
I wanna get a meeting scheduled on this,
soon as we can. Thursday at the latest.

1215
01:45:26,700 --> 01:45:29,100
I think we should have someone from
the equity group there.

1216
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:30,300
- Jeff.
- Maybe McDonnell...

1217
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:32,000
- Yeah?
- Did you hear?

1218
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:36,200
- Yeah, yeah. They closed U/North.
MAN: No. Michael Clayton.
What?

1219
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:39,500
Car bomb. Upstate. This morning.
He was killed.

1220
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:41,300
What?

1221
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,900
Holy shit.

1222
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:04,000
KAREN: It has been and it remains
the U/North position...

1223
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:08,200
... that this lawsuit is baseless
and without merit.

1224
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:12,500
Our reluctance to negotiate
was anchored by this belief...

1225
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:17,800
...and reinforced by the plaintiffs' demand
for settlement...

1226
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,600
...in excess of 3 billion dollars.

1227
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:24,200
The reason that we are
all here today is...

1228
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:28,200
...that several key elements
in the case have changed.

1229
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:33,700
You all have
a tentative proposal packet...

1230
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:38,200
... which outlines the details,
but the bottom line is this:

1231
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:41,200
Over the past several months
we had gotten word...

1232
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:44,700
...that the plaintiffs were
growing impatient...

1233
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:48,900
...and were in the process
of revising their settlement numbers.

1234
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:54,800
We also learned...
... that the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees
were capped at 32 percent...

1235
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:57,300
... up to 400 million dollars...

1236
01:46:57,500 --> 01:47:01,700
...above which,
their fees dropped to 24 percent.

1237
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:06,400
So we knew that there would be
this motivational dead zone for them...

1238
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:08,500
...in the middle there.

1239
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:10,400
Finally...

1240
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:14,900
...our finance team informed us
that they had run the numbers...

1241
01:47:15,100 --> 01:47:16,900
...and that the tax benefit...

1242
01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:20,300
...provided that we bring
the settlement in under 600 million...

1243
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:22,900
...and within this fiscal year...

1244
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:29,000
...that the write-off on this settlement
would essentially pay for itself.

1245
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:33,700
The package that you have before you
represents, in my judgment...

1246
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:38,900
... the strongest possible position for
our company under the circumstances.

1247
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:44,200
And, as chief counsel...
...it is my recommendation
that this proposal be confirmed.

1248
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:48,800
Thank you, Karen. If you just give us
a few minutes to talk about it.

1249
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,400
Certainly. I'll be right outside.

1250
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:54,800
Well...

1251
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:19,600
How'd it go in there?

1252
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:24,800
Pretty freaky, huh?

1253
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,600
Did you see Arthur?
He's wandering around here somewhere.

1254
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:33,800
I'm kidding. Lighten up.

1255
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:39,600
You got one of these? It's a great memo.
It's an oldie but a goodie.

1256
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:43,700
Got your heart racing, don't I?

1257
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:47,500
I don't know what it is
you think you're doing.
What do you think I'm doing?

1258
01:48:47,700 --> 01:48:52,400
The suit's over. We have a deal.
Whatever that is,
it's meaningless at this point.

1259
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:56,200
You think? I must have gotten it wrong.
I thought you had a tentative proposal.

1260
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:58,600
I didn't realize you'd signed
all those checks.

1261
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:03,600
That's a drag. I got a thousand of these.
What am I gonna do with them?
I'm calling Marty.

1262
01:49:03,700 --> 01:49:06,100
Good. Good. Do it.
That's a great place to start.

1263
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:09,100
Let's find out who told him
Arthur was calling Anna Kysersun.

1264
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:11,100
Let's find out who tapped those phones.

1265
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:15,000
This memorandum, even if it's authentic,
which I doubt, I highly doubt...

1266
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:18,600
- I know what you did to Arthur.
- It's protected. It belongs to U/North.

1267
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:21,600
- I know you killed him.
- It's attorney-client privilege.

1268
01:49:21,700 --> 01:49:25,400
See, now, that's just not
the way to go here, Karen.

1269
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:29,800
For such a smart person,
you really are lost, aren't you?
This conversation is over.

1270
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,600
I'm not the guy that you kill.
I'm the guy that you buy.

1271
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:36,100
Are you so fucking blind
you don't even see what I am?

1272
01:49:36,300 --> 01:49:39,700
I'm the easiest part of your whole
goddamn problem and you're gonna kill me?

1273
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:43,400
Don't you know who I am?
I'm a fixer. I'm a bagman.

1274
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:46,800
I do everything from shoplifting housewives
to bent congressmen...

1275
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:49,100
...and you're gonna kill me?

1276
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:52,600
What do you need, Karen? Lay it on me.

1277
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:56,500
You want a carry permit? You want
a heads-up on an insider-trading subpoena?

1278
01:49:56,600 --> 01:50:00,900
I sold out Arthur for 80 grand
and a contract and you're gonna kill me?

1279
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,600
What do you want?

1280
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:05,100
What do I want?

1281
01:50:05,300 --> 01:50:06,900
I want more.

1282
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:09,200
I want out.

1283
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:12,000
And with this, I want everything.

1284
01:50:13,700 --> 01:50:16,700
Is there a number?
Ten is a number.

1285
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:18,900
Ten? Ten what?

1286
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,500
Ten million?

1287
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:26,100
Where do you think I'm gonna get
10 million dollars?

1288
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:31,000
You know what's great about this?
Did you read it to the end?
You see who signed it?

1289
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:36,600
Let's go in and ask Don Jeffries...
...if he wants to pass the hat
for a worthy cause.

1290
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:40,900
This would have to be
a longer conversation...

1291
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:44,800
...and would have to take place
somewhere else.
Where? My car?

1292
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:47,700
All right.

1293
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:51,700
I'm gonna make it easy. Let's make it 5.

1294
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:54,300
Five and I'll forget about Arthur.

1295
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:00,800
Five is easier. Yeah, 5 is something
that we could talk about.

1296
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:04,800
Good. And then the other 5 is
to forget about the 468 people...

1297
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:06,900
...that you knocked off
with your weed killer.

1298
01:51:07,100 --> 01:51:12,200
Let me finish up this meeting.
I'll talk to Don...
Do I look like I'm negotiating?!

1299
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:13,800
DON:
Karen?

1300
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:17,100
KAREN: One second.
- Everything okay?

1301
01:51:17,700 --> 01:51:18,700
Yes.

1302
01:51:19,700 --> 01:51:23,700
Ten million dollars. Bank of my choosing.
Offshore. Immediately.

1303
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:24,800
- Yes.
- Say it!

1304
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,800
Ten million dollars, your account,
the moment this meeting is through.

1305
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:33,700
DON: Karen! Everyone's waiting.
KAREN: I'm coming, Don.
You have a deal.

1306
01:51:34,300 --> 01:51:35,900
