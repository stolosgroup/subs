"There was a time
when children dreaded the night,

3
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,250
for the sleeping hours
brought visions of horror."

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,833
"The dark times
when those terrible sea beasts

5
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:35,333
would ravage our shores,

6
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:38,291
and no ship was safe on the sea."

7
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:43,583
"But thanks to the hunters,
those days are over."

8
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:48,958
"Today, these valiant warriors
battle the beasts far beyond the horizon,

9
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:53,875
risking their lives to rid the seas
of those nightmare creatures."

10
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:57,875
"And the greatest of the hunting ships
is the Inevitable..."

11
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:00,791
"And the greatest of the hunters
is Captain Crow!"

12
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,250
- Yar!
- Captain Crow!

13
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,083
I'm Captain Crow. Smelly old beast!

14
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,541
Hey.

15
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,583
Who's reading this story?

16
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:10,750
Oh my word!

17
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:11,666
What's this?

18
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,166
Lights-out was an hour ago.
Oh, you'll be the death of me.

19
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,833
Come on. Along. Along you pop.

20
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,291
And, Miss Maisie,

21
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,958
the king and queen
care for you hunter orphans

22
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,500
out of their kindness.

23
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:28,791
When you disobey the house rules,
you disrespect them.

24
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:33,833
So we're not going to have
any more attempts now, are we?

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,208
Absolutely not.

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hmm.

27
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:43,625
Hmm.

28
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,666
Fair travels, me swabs.

29
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,375
And remember,

30
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,958
live a great life

31
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,125
and die a great death.

32
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,458
- Bye-bye, Maisie!
- We'll miss you!

33
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,791
See you tomorrow!

34
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,875
All hands on deck!

35
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,083
All together now!

36
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,750
Heave away!

37
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,125
Hold your tongues!

38
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,541
- Where'd you see it?
- Dead ahead, Jacob.

39
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:57,958
Huh.

40
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,083
Are you sure?

41
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:02,958
Aye, a red tail. Biggest I ever saw.
Just under the surface.

42
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,916
Then today is the day.

43
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:12,875
It's the Red Bluster.

44
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,083
I know it in me bones.

45
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:16,458
See there!

46
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,625
Birds follow it.

47
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:22,708
- We come all this way for a proper fight.
- And we'll get it, me boy.

48
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,875
It's been 30 years
since that thing took me deadlight.

49
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,291
Now I'll have me revenge.

50
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,375
Aye.

51
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:29,833
Well,

52
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,291
we've passed Rum Pepper Island.

53
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,250
It's heading for the Dregmorr Sea.

54
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,625
If we're gonna do battle

55
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,333
with the greatest
and most terrible thing in the sea,

56
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,083
it's best not to wait till after.

57
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,541
There might not be an after.

58
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:56,041
Haul away, all!
Haul, you dogs!

59
00:04:58,708 --> 00:04:59,750
Captain!

60
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,666
It's another hunting ship under attack!

61
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,250
It's Jim Nicklebones' ship.

62
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,833
- It looks like he's found a brickleback.
- I'd say it found him.

63
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,000
We have to help him.

64
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,625
What course, Captain?

65
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:24,958
- We press on.
- What?

66
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,802
If Jim Nicklebones were
half the sea dog he says he is,

67
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,500
he wouldn't be in this mess.

68
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,583
Captain, you know the code.

69
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:36,791
It binds us to all who come before
and all who come after.

70
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,541
And even that rum gagger Jim Nicklebones.

71
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,750
Ms. Merino, set a new course.

72
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,166
Aye, Captain.

73
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,958
Strike the spanker!

74
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,750
Clew up for an' main.

75
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,750
Thirty years I've waited.

76
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,375
Thirty years!

77
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,375
Blast!

78
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,750
Rudder to midship.
Come around!

79
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,791
Don't worry. We'll be to the Bluster
in no time, Captain.

80
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,375
Drive her down, Mr. Crisp!

81
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:24,333
It's too much, Captain! We're going down!

82
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,875
This is it, mates!

83
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,625
It's been me honor to serve with ya.

84
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,416
Haul away!

85
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,333
By God, it's the Inevitable!

86
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,625
Have at it, Black Bird!

87
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,958
Let it know we're here!

88
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:06,666
We've joined.

89
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,500
We have weather gauge.
Shall we draw it upwind?

90
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,916
Aye, and cross the T.

91
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,708
Hard to port, Mr. Crisp!

92
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,750
I'll have her into the wind
as high as she'll bear, Ms. Merino!

93
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:21,416
Furl the main and fore,
and ease your headsails, swabbies.

94
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,041
Mainsail haul!

95
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,041
Here we go!

96
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,125
Heads up.

97
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:29,500
Aim low.

98
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,875
All right, ya fish killers!

99
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,791
We come all this way for a proper fight.

100
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,458
And now, we'll get it!

101
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,416
Nearly there, Captain.

102
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,750
Aye, Sarah.

103
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,500
Now, to port, Ms. Merino. And cross the T!

104
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,333
You heard him, ya lubbers!

105
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,708
Haul your mizzen! Main and fore!

106
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,875
Make it scream, piper!

107
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,416
Here we go!

108
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Fire!

109
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:43,625
We've not discouraged our prey.
Quite the opposite, I'm afraid!

110
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,125
Not to worry, Jacob.

111
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,125
Clew up aloft, Ms. Merino.

112
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,333
Haul away
your main and mizzen!

113
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,791
Topsail, clew lines!

114
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,791
- Haul away!
- Loose!

115
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,458
It's diving!

116
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,666
Get under the companionway
and don't come out till it's settled.

117
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:40,958
Clever fish.

118
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:42,833
It's gone upwind.

119
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,833
Stand to. Wait for the word!

120
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,083
You heard the captain!
Hands to braces.

121
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:51,750
Stand by, all!

122
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,666
No birds.

123
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,750
It's smarter than we think.
The line's been severed.

124
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,541
It's below us.

125
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,833
Whoa!

126
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,000
Jacob!

127
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:09,916
Whoa!

128
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,416
Don't worry, lad.

129
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,291
- We got it right where we want it.
- Jacob, look out!

130
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,583
Jacob!

131
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,791
Man overboard! Hard to port!

132
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,916
- Haul them lines, ya swabs!
- Hard to port!

133
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,500
Whoa!

134
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,333
Time has come, ya devil!

135
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:13,708
Captain.

136
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,208
- Captain.
- He's coming to.

137
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,583
Captain! Captain!

138
00:14:56,625 --> 00:15:00,416
Captain, the mizzen's in splinters,
and I don't like the main.

139
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,833
She can't fight.

140
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,250
Then we'll come back
for the Bluster when she can.

141
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,166
- Repairs shouldn't take too...
- Set a course for Three Bridges.

142
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,416
We're going home.

143
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,791
Right mess, aren't ya?

144
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,708
Let's get you fixed up.

145
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,291
If you know
what's good for ya,

146
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,541
you'll keep clear of the captain.

147
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,166
He was close enough
to smell that red devil.

148
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:38,125
But if he can't have the Bluster's hide,
he'll have ours, to be sure.

149
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,833
Why, it's gloomy
as the Helgard trenches in here.

150
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:50,541
We've taken
some right proper monsters on this hunt,

151
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,041
and the royals will pay us accordingly.

152
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,458
And then we'll come back,
and we'll take that red devil.

153
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,625
Can we beat it, Jacob?
They say the Bluster moves the very sea.

154
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:04,833
Aye, and it shoots fireballs
out of its eyes, they say.

155
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,958
It's enough to make your knees wobble.

156
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:12,416
But I ain't afraid,
'cause I'm on the Inevitable with you lot.

157
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,500
This ship has taken
more of them beasts than any other,

158
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,708
and she's got the scars to prove it.

159
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,500
As do we, Jacob!

160
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:22,916
Aye.

161
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,833
And every hunter's scar is a life saved.

162
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,750
A merchant sailor on their first voyage.

163
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,208
A mother.

164
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,541
A son.

165
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,833
All hunters die of the same thing.

166
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:43,458
Aye, being a hunter.

167
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,833
That's right. Being a hunter.

168
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,666
But every hunter dies a great death.

169
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,750
Because every hunter lives a great life!

170
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,916
Jacob!

171
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,291
Captain would like a word.

172
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,541
Speaking of dying a great death.

173
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,458
Nice knowing you, Jacob!

174
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:16,625
We'll think of you often and fondly.

175
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,666
You wanted to see me, Captain?

176
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:25,708
Sit.

177
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,500
Captain, we'll get the Bluster.

178
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,666
We know where it is now,
and you will have your revenge.

179
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,416
I'm... I'm just sorry it wasn't today.

180
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:42,666
Jacob, I hate that devil
with every fiber in me being,

181
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,541
but saving Jim Nicklebones
was the right thing to do.

182
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,583
You steered me right today.

183
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,708
Well, I'm... I-I'm glad you see it that way.

184
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:57,791
So we'll go home,
collect our bounty, and repair the ship.

185
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:03,750
And we'll come back for that beast
and bring hell down upon it.

186
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,166
And then what?

187
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,083
What is to become of the Inevitable

188
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,208
after I'm gone?

189
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,666
Through battle and wear,

190
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,375
every beam, block,
and spar has been replaced

191
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,166
since the day she was launched.

192
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,000
Yet she lives on.

193
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,875
It's an eternal thing.

194
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:41,708
But I am not.

195
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,125
Come.

196
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,875
Here is my greatness.

197
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,500
My father's before me,

198
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,166
and his father's before him.

199
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,541
On the day we take the Red Bluster,

200
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,375
I will make me last entry as captain.

201
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,000
Then it'll be your time.

202
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,541
I've known it since the day
I pulled you from the sea.

203
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,125
<i>You'd been out there for days.</i>

204
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,291
But there was something in you, Jacob.

205
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,041
A fire that wouldn't die.

206
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,166
Then I held you,

207
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:34,291
and I knew.

208
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,875
The fates had brought me a son.

209
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:42,958
And that one day,
you would be captain of the Inevitable.

210
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,416
The day you found me,

211
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:02,750
I swore I would do everything in my power
to keep people safe from them demons.

212
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,416
If you would grant me this ship,
I would accept,

213
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,125
and it would be my honor.

214
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:14,708
My boy.

215
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,041
You're gonna do great things.

216
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,958
It's the Inevitable!
The Inevitable's back!

217
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,166
- Look!
- What a sight!

218
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,375
Bet she's got a belly full of bones!

219
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,333
The Inevitable!

220
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,291
It's good to be home at last,

221
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,208
but it will be a short stay, I'm afraid.

222
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:11,375
Captain Crow will visit
the king and queen at first light.

223
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,208
And when the ship is ready,

224
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,083
we'll be off to kill a monster!

225
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:20,500
We're going after the Red Bluster!

226
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,291
So if this be our last visit
to Three Bridges,

227
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:27,291
I expect some right, proper debauchery!

228
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:33,708
Go on, then.
Make way for the hunters.

229
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,000
Here we go, mates!

230
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,666
The Crown will pay well for them horns.

231
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,791
So the drinks are on us!

232
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,041
No one goes thirsty tonight, swabbies!

233
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,541
Come on, then!

234
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:58,958

244
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:31,708
Hello!

245
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:33,500
Hello.

246
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,166
Me name's Maisie.

247
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,500
Maisie Brumble.

248
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,625
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

249
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,375
And you're Jacob Holland,

250
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:43,541
who once killed four of them beasts
in a span of two days.

251
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,250
Is it true you done that?

252
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,875
Four in two days?

253
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:51,041
- Don't believe everything you hear, lass.
- Four in two days?

254
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:52,625
It was five.

255
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:54,791
I heard...

256
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:02,625
I heard there was a time them beasts
used to come right up to shore,

257
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:05,083
pluck a lady
right out of her veggie patch,

258
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:06,500
and swallow her up!

259
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:10,083
But not no more.
And it's 'cause of the hunters.

260
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:12,791
There's not a nobler profession, I says.

261
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:15,458
I come from a long line of hunters meself.

262
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:16,541
Is that so?

263
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,250
Aye. Me parents were lancers.
They served on the Monarch.

264
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,583
The Monarch.

265
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,666
- So they're...
- Aye.

266
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,583
That's just the way for a hunter,
ain't it?

267
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:32,125
You live a great life
and die a great death.

268
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,791
Huh. Come on.

269
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:42,083
So, uh, who's looking after you then?

270
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm staying at a children's home
in Guelston, up the way.

271
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:47,750
Except I ain't staying exactly.

272
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,791
I'm on the run, you see.

273
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:52,791
And I ain't going back.

274
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:56,000
'Cause I'm joining your crew.

275
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,250
Oh, no, you ain't.
A hunting ship ain't no place for a kid.

276
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:04,708
You joined the ship when you were me age,
and look at you now.

277
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:07,333
You're a weapon
against nature's darkest design.

278
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:09,541
It says so on page 92.

279
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,500
Look, kid, I'm clever with a spear,
but I've been lucky more than once.

280
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,291
There's no guarantee
of making it to page 92.

281
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,375
Trust me.

282
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,791
Now, you should run along.

283
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:29,958
Right, then. I'll talk to Captain Crow.
That's a man with real authority.

284
00:24:31,166 --> 00:24:33,333
Do you know
where I might find Captain Crow?

285
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,541
Hey! I... I have authority.

286
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:37,875
- All right?
- You ain't captain, are ya?

287
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:41,458
Uh, no, but I am captain material.

288
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:44,166
"Captain material?"

289
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:50,500
- Sorry. It just sounds funny.
- I mean, I will <i>be </i>captain.

290
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:54,458
- Someday.
- Well, I intend to get on that ship.

291
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:56,500
So, if you don't mind,

292
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,375
I'll take it up with Captain Now,

293
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:00,750
not Captain Someday.

294
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,291
Hey! Put me down! Let me go!

295
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:07,041
Monster hunters are supposed to be heroes.

296
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,958
And here's me saving you.

297
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:11,333
Evening, Rosie. You go through Guelston?

298
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:12,416
Aye.

299
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:14,666
Right. Let her out there and not before.

300
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:18,166
- If that's not too much trouble.
- Aye.

301
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:20,208
Hey!

302
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:22,125
This is kidnapping!

303
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:25,416
No, love. It's the opposite
of kidnapping.

304
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:37,083
New friend, Jacob?

305
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,416
Ah, just some kid.

306
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,458
Urgh. Horrible things, children.

307
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,125
You can say that again.

308
00:26:03,416 --> 00:26:06,041
- Captain Crow!
- It's full of brickleback!

309
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:18,666
Well, if it isn't Captain Crow
and his loyal mates.

310
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:24,541
Your Grace, as you can see,
the oceans have offered abundant prey.

311
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,833
And I see you've taken
a full-grown brickleback.

312
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:31,291
A specimen like that
garners quite a bounty.

313
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:35,083
But there's something I don't see.

314
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:38,208
The horn of the Red Bluster.

315
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:42,708
Admiral Hornagold has reported a rumor...

316
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:44,875
Admiral Hornagold?

317
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:50,166
...that you spotted the Red Bluster,
but abandoned your pursuit

318
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,291
because of a certain code.

319
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:59,041
The royals don't pay you
to honor such codes.

320
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:02,833
They pay you to kill monsters.

321
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:08,958
How many more ships will be lost
because you let the Bluster slip away?

322
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:16,458
This was once a small kingdom
with a big idea.

323
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:20,250
To send hunters out
to repel the beasts from our shores

324
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:24,125
and usher in a new era of peace.

325
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:28,083
It's been hundreds of years
since the dark times,

326
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:30,791
but as long as the Bluster lives,

327
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:34,291
people will still
look to the seas with fear.

328
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:38,750
So today marks the beginning of a new era.

329
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:42,875
The Crown will no longer
support the hunters.

330
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:44,541
She's quite a sight, isn't she?

331
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:48,166
The Imperator is the most
heavily-armed ship ever to set sail.

332
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,750
The Royal Navy will push
deep into the unknown world

333
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:56,166
and eradicate every sea beast in our path.

334
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:57,833
Not in that thing.

335
00:27:57,916 --> 00:27:59,250
She rests too low.

336
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:01,958
And them fixed cannons is useless.

337
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:05,333
And her Captain is an ass.

338
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:08,666
It's time
for you to leave, Captain.

339
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,666
Your time is up.

340
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:17,000
Admiral, have you ever seen one of them
beasts that wasn't hanging from a ceiling?

341
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:21,291
Don't send your soldiers to die
in a ship like that.

342
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:23,500
It's not built for hunting,

343
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:25,583
and neither are you.

344
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:30,333
I assure you,
I am not afraid of those beasts.

345
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:31,625
Then you're a fool!

346
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:34,375
And you'll take
a lot of good sailors down with you!

347
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:37,833
General, see the hunters out.
We're done with them.

348
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:42,333
We hunters have shed blood,
while you lot hid behind walls

349
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:44,541
and drew lines on maps.

350
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:46,333
You're cowards, the lot of ya!

351
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:50,458
General, the Captain
is to be placed under arrest,

352
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:53,541
and the Inevitable decommissioned.

353
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:55,958
W-W-Wait, wait!

354
00:28:58,416 --> 00:29:00,958
Uh, Your Grace.

355
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,250
The, uh... The Captain
is well-known for his temper,

356
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:08,333
but his talents as a hunter
have served you well.

357
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:10,041
He's opened the seas

358
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:13,375
and made your empire
the envy of the known world.

359
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:18,250
Now, I believe the world
still needs the hunters,

360
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:19,416
so prove me wrong.

361
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:23,125
Give us one more try for the Bluster.

362
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:28,125
If we take it, you keep your promise,
and we continue our alliance.

363
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:30,250
If the Imperator takes the Bluster,

364
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,291
well, you can tear down
the Inevitable for scrap,

365
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,916
and the days of the hunters will be over.

366
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:37,666
Either way,

367
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,750
you win.

368
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:42,458
I, for one, would relish the opportunity.

369
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:46,750
Then we have a contest.

370
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:50,666
Get set.

371
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,458
Go.

372
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:57,500
We'll take the Bluster
and bring it to your doorstep.

373
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,333
The days of hunters are not over.

374
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:02,083
Not nearly.

375
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:12,416
When we reach the Dregmorr,
we'll follow the trenches.

376
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,916
We stay battle-ready, clear decks,
sharpened flints, and fresh cartridge.

377
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,041
The Bluster's hide will be plenty thick.

378
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:22,208
Best to use the long spears.

379
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:27,250
<i>Them archers won't do any good,
but we've got plenty of carcass shot.</i>

380
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:30,541
<i>We'll hit it with fire,
then go for a sleigh ride.</i>

381
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:32,625
<i>That's the way with something like this.</i>

382
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:36,500
<i>We're ready, Captain.
We'll take that red demon.</i>

383
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:39,333
For we are hunters.

384
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:41,708
And we will bring all of our skill

385
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:46,125
and all of our rage down upon this beast.

386
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:48,875
And there will be justice!

387
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:55,000
But that will not be the end
of this great ship.

388
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:58,583
For no one has sailed
beyond the Dregmorr Sea.

389
00:30:58,666 --> 00:31:01,291
No one knows what dangers lurk

390
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:03,208
in that terrible unknown.

391
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,583
But it will be this ship,

392
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:10,250
under Jacob Holland,
that will pierce the darkness.

393
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So let's drink to a successful hunt,
with many more to come.

394
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:28,458
- Ow!
- What was that?

395
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:32,041
- It came from the keg.
- What was that?

396
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,583
You stowed away?

397
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:44,916
I stowed away.

398
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,708
You stowed away.

399
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:47,791
Uh, I...

400
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,625
Yeah.

401
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:52,000
Well, we're dropping you off
at the nearest port.

402
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:53,708
We're going after the Bluster.

403
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:56,833
- We can't have a kid mucking about.
- What's this?

404
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:01,666
The name's Maisie Brumble,

405
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:05,166
but you need no introduction.

406
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,833
You've been swallowed whole,

407
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:11,125
shot through the heart, and cut to pieces.

408
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:15,666
But the worms won't eat you,
and hell won't take you, so here you are!

409
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:19,083
The right, proud commander
of the second-greatest hunting ship

410
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:20,500
what ever sailed.

411
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,083
Second-greatest?

412
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:25,583
Which then, may I ask, is the greatest?

413
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:28,250
I'm partial to the Monarch,

414
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:30,708
for it's the ship me parents served on.

415
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:32,958
I see.

416
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:36,000
Then they died heroes, didn't they?

417
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Aye.

418
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,041
I like this kid.

419
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:43,291
- She's all vinegar.
- But, C-Captain...

420
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,708
Sarah, be good enough to take her in,
would you?

421
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:47,500
Aye, Captain.

422
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:51,333
Congratulations, Captain Someday.

423
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:53,041
Uh...

424
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:24,916
Sleep there.

425
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:29,583
You're... Sarah Sharpe.

426
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:35,750
They say no first mate
is more loyal than...

427
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:36,916
That's enough.

428
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:39,333
I've heard your speeches, Miss.

429
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:42,250
My speeches kept me on this boat.

430
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:46,291
You're on this boat because Captain Crow
won't stop to put you off it.

431
00:33:47,916 --> 00:33:49,500
The hunt is all.

432
00:33:50,416 --> 00:33:53,416
So give him your absolute obedience.

433
00:33:56,833 --> 00:33:58,375
Or fall on that yourself,

434
00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:01,250
because I'll visit worse than death on ya.

435
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,416
You're

436
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,041
amazing.

437
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:26,958
We passed Rum Pepper Island in the night.

438
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:29,208
We've reached the Dregmorr.

439
00:34:29,291 --> 00:34:32,375
Aye, and we'll find
that thing soon enough.

440
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:42,000
I wonder if I might need
something a little... larger?

441
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:44,166
Hey, where'd you get that knife?

442
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:47,625
Sarah gave it to me,
'cause I'm a hunter now.

443
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:51,708
- A hunter who needs to go to bed.
- But I'm too much awake to sleep.

444
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:54,291
I'm on the Inevitable with Captain Crow.

445
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:56,833
Them pictures in me books come to life,

446
00:34:56,916 --> 00:34:59,750
and exacting bloody revenge!

447
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:02,041
Go, get your rest.

448
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:05,083
Aye, Captain.

449
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:07,416
We's gonna kill that thing, ain't we?

450
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,458
And they'll make statues of us.

451
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,708
We'll kill it, all right. Now get!

452
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:13,166
Hmm.

453
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:17,875
The monsters, I can handle.

454
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:20,458
But that one, she'll be the death of me.

455
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:25,750
You'll recall the hunter's code
binds us to all who come before

456
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,541
and all who come after.

457
00:35:29,916 --> 00:35:31,708
I see a fire in her.

458
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:33,791
Same fire I saw in you.

459
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:44,875
Beat to quarters!

460
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:47,208
Let's have her ready!

461
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:50,791
Today's the day we do what we do!

462
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:58,125
Fighting trim! Clew up fore a' main!

463
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:02,333
Harpooners, tie off them darts!
We're going for a sleigh ride!

464
00:36:04,416 --> 00:36:05,916
Heave away!

465
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:17,250
Brace!

466
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:38,916
The ocean has sent us its worst,
and we'll send it right back.

467
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,250
Carcass shot if you please, gunners!

468
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,958
Protect our broadside.

469
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:46,583
All right, ya fish killers!

470
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:49,500
We come all this way
for a proper fight and...

471
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:50,583
Jacob!

472
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,458
What's happening?

473
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:54,791
Maisie, get back to your room!

474
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,958
Go.

475
00:37:05,416 --> 00:37:07,208
Stay away from the window.

476
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:14,833
Hurry, lad!

477
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:31,458
Fire!

478
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:48,250
Now's our chance! Spears!

479
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,458
We got it hooked. Now we'll wear it down.

480
00:38:08,541 --> 00:38:10,375
Full sail, Ms. Merino!

481
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:13,000
Square the yards!
Get it off the pins!

482
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:16,750
It'll fight the very wind
till there's no fight left in it.

483
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:24,291
Run, ya devil! And there we'll be!

484
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:44,833
Captain?

485
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:50,458
We've got you now.

486
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,333
The ship can't take it.

487
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:29,958
We have to cut the lines.

488
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:33,041
I've never run from a fight,
and I won't start now.

489
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:34,166
We must!

490
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,666
Even dead, it'll drag us to the bottom!

491
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:57,583
Time has come for ye, ye devil.

492
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:09,541
Maisie Brumble, cut those lines,
and I'll kill you for a coward!

493
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:14,083
Jacob, stop her!

494
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:38,208
Jacob!

495
00:41:22,916 --> 00:41:25,625
Bring her to me!

496
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:30,250
- What are you gonna do?
- I said bring her to me!

497
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:32,791
- She's just a child.
- I'm giving you an order!

498
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:34,625
Please, Captain.

499
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:37,958
Bring... her... to... me.

500
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:45,333
Jacob!

501
00:42:17,916 --> 00:42:18,916
Are we gonna

502
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:21,625
die in here?

503
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:30,458
No.

504
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:37,333
Well,

505
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:38,958
yeah.

506
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:43,875
Is it gonna chew us,

507
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:50,250
or will we get digested slowly with acids?

508
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:53,958
I don't know, Maisie.
This is all new territory for me.

509
00:42:54,041 --> 00:42:56,750
Haven't you hunted these things
your whole life?

510
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:59,166
We kill 'em, lass. We don't study 'em.

511
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:04,958
I guess it's time to start.

512
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:18,125
Jacob,

513
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:20,000
what if it swallows you?

514
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,041
Cut the rope.

515
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:17,041
- What are you going to do?
- I'm gonna kill it.

516
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:18,708
Kill it? How?

517
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:21,791
Well, I don't know.
I just get pumped up and kind of wing it.

518
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:24,833
I don't want to overthink this, all right?
I'm just gonna kill it.

519
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,541
I don't know about this.

520
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:29,166
I'm Jacob Holland, remember,

521
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,708
who killed five of them beasts
in the span of two days.

522
00:45:31,791 --> 00:45:34,541
And this is just another beast.

523
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:39,416
There has to be another way!

524
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,750
Afraid not, lass.

525
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:43,875
Well, c-can you kill it from the inside?

526
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,416
Whoa!

527
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:50,791
Whoa!

528
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:26,541
Hold on, lass.

529
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:32,125
Huh?

530
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:38,333
Jacob!

531
00:47:26,666 --> 00:47:27,666
No, wait!

532
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:40,083
Oof!

533
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:51,083
W-W-Wait, Jacob! No!

534
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:52,041
Stop!

535
00:48:02,791 --> 00:48:04,375
Oh bloody hell.

536
00:48:04,458 --> 00:48:05,458
Whoa!

537
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:11,541
Whoa. Whoa!

538
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,458
You could've killed me!

539
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:36,375
Wha... I could have killed you?

540
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:39,625
You got it backwards, lass.

541
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,458
I had it dead to rights,
and you bollocksed it up.

542
00:48:42,541 --> 00:48:43,666
Dead to rights?

543
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,916
I must have been watching
a different fight.

544
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,333
We wouldn't have been fighting at all
if you hadn't cut them lines.

545
00:48:49,416 --> 00:48:50,875
We cut them lines.

546
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:53,291
No, you cut them lines.

547
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:55,041
You didn't stop me, did ya?

548
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:57,000
That's not the same thing.

549
00:48:57,083 --> 00:48:58,083
Isn't it?

550
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:00,750
No, it isn't.

551
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:21,250
We'd best find shelter.

552
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:47,708
Get your strength.

553
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:49,791
We're leaving in the morning.

554
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:07,958
Me book says the beasts
used to come right up to shore.

555
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:10,583
That nowhere was safe.

556
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:12,666
Is that true?

557
00:50:13,916 --> 00:50:15,166
Of course it's true.

558
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
You saw it?

559
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:21,166
It was before my time,
but everyone knows it's true.

560
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:25,375
What if them things
ain't as bad as they say?

561
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:28,166
I mean, the sea is their home.

562
00:50:28,916 --> 00:50:31,000
We went after <i>her,</i> didn't we?

563
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,291
What if we just left 'em alone?

564
00:50:34,375 --> 00:50:37,041
We kill them because they kill us.

565
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:40,708
Do I need to remind you
that one of them things took your parents?

566
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:42,833
Should they have just left
the monsters alone?

567
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:46,708
I... don't know.

568
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:48,875
Oh, you are lost, girl.

569
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:50,625
Your parents died heroes.

570
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:53,958
I want to believe that,

571
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:59,458
but maybe you can be a hero
and still be wrong.

572
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:04,333
You're not making...

573
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:09,125
- You're not making any sense.
- Why did Red swallow us?

574
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:10,625
Oh, "Red," is it?

575
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:12,083
She, not it.

576
00:51:12,166 --> 00:51:15,458
I think it's a she, and I think
she was protecting us from Crow.

577
00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:18,416
You're giving that beast
way too much credit.

578
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,750
- He was pointing a gun at you, and he...
- He was pointing it at you, through me.

579
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:24,750
Because you cut them lines.

580
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:26,666
I don't wanna argue about it, all right?

581
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,708
'Cause I don't want to attract
any of the multitude of monsters

582
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:30,833
on this island,

583
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:34,041
that, that I wouldn't be on
if you hadn't cut them lines!

584
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,125
So we're not arguing?

585
00:51:38,125 --> 00:51:39,250
So what are we doing?

586
00:51:43,458 --> 00:51:46,666
I'm going to gather supplies.

587
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:50,291
I'll take you to Guelston,
and when I get back to the ship,

588
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:53,125
we'll finish what we started.

589
00:51:55,666 --> 00:51:58,041
Don't... get killed out there.

590
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:00,750
I won't make any promises.

591
00:52:02,291 --> 00:52:03,291
Jacob.

592
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:06,750
Promise.

593
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,250
All right.

594
00:52:10,041 --> 00:52:11,041
I promise.

595
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Captain,

596
00:52:40,583 --> 00:52:41,833
the beast is gone.

597
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:44,500
We can't stay out here.

598
00:52:45,708 --> 00:52:47,458
That thing took Jacob.

599
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:50,333
And I want it dead same as you,

600
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:53,125
but we'll founder if we don't get to port.

601
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,458
She's making more water
than we can pump out.

602
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:00,958
And the patch we fothered keeps slipping.

603
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:04,000
If we stay out here much longer,
we'll be sunk.

604
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:12,291
Shape a course for Mukesh Island.

605
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:16,583
- But the closest port is...
- Mukesh!

606
00:53:17,166 --> 00:53:20,083
It'll be Mukesh by thunder,
or the ocean floor.

607
00:53:22,041 --> 00:53:26,541
Would you be planning a visit
to Gwen Batterbie, by any chance?

608
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,250
Captain, her wares come
at too steep a price.

609
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:36,458
To make covenant with the likes of her
is against the hunter's code.

610
00:53:36,541 --> 00:53:39,083
Blast whatever code
would bar me my revenge!

611
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:41,916
There be no charter over me own.

612
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,750
I'll use Batterbie's methods.
I'll do whatever it takes.

613
00:53:45,833 --> 00:53:47,916
I'd cleave the very sea

614
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,625
and destroy everything that swims,
scuttles, or bobs if I have to.

615
00:53:53,208 --> 00:53:54,791
But I'll have vengeance.

616
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:59,708
I'll have vengeance.

617
00:54:24,666 --> 00:54:28,916
Trim the sails
for a new course! Keep her full and by!

618
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:12,333
Hey, little guy.

619
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:39,125
These things ain't so bad.

620
00:55:43,333 --> 00:55:44,333
Uh...

621
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:51,000
What are you doing?

622
00:55:51,541 --> 00:55:52,541
I, uh...

623
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:56,625
I'm afraid anything I say will upset you.

624
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:58,666
You're probably right.

625
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,958
Just don't move.

626
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I'm sorry,

627
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,416
but I've always wanted a pet.

628
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,416
That's not a pet.

629
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,458
It's a monster, and we're not keeping it.

630
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:14,375
But I already named it.

631
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:15,458
Let me guess.

632
00:56:15,791 --> 00:56:16,791
Blue.

633
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,916
You named that one Red.
You named this one Blue.

634
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,458
We stay much longer, and we'll have
a rainbow of critters that wanna eat us.

635
00:56:24,541 --> 00:56:26,208
But he's so cute!

636
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:27,750
Look at this face.

637
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,166
You and I have a different idea of cute.

638
00:56:33,166 --> 00:56:34,166
No!

639
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,541
When we get to Guelston,

640
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:41,833
I'll get you a cat,
and you can name it Grey or White.

641
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:43,541
Ginger, if you like.

642
00:56:43,625 --> 00:56:45,333
You're too young to be this mean.

643
00:56:45,416 --> 00:56:49,000
And you're too old
to be giving in to childish temptations.

644
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:51,250
It ain't childish to want a pet.

645
00:56:51,333 --> 00:56:52,916
Lots of people have pets.

646
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,166
Not pets that will lay eggs in your mouth

647
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:57,916
that hatch and burst out
through your chest cavity!

648
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:01,958
That is so specific.

649
00:57:02,041 --> 00:57:03,916
Well, I seen some things, all right?

650
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,291
Point is we don't know what he'd do.

651
00:57:06,375 --> 00:57:08,125
We don't know anything about this island,

652
00:57:08,208 --> 00:57:10,125
except we've got to get off it,
by thunder!

653
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,041
Uh...

654
00:57:35,416 --> 00:57:36,416
Best be going.

655
00:57:47,125 --> 00:57:49,958
Maybe they're bonded to us, like geese.

656
00:57:50,041 --> 00:57:52,125
It's the mother goose I'm worried about.

657
00:58:00,291 --> 00:58:02,250
There she is. Come on, lass.

658
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:31,750
Hmm.

659
00:58:34,333 --> 00:58:35,541
Hold the rudder.

660
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:41,916
If we can make it to Rum Pepper Island,
we'll be able to flag a ship.

661
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,541
The Dregmorr is thick with monsters,
but don't worry.

662
00:58:45,041 --> 00:58:48,583
If there's one of them things
within a mile of us, I'll sense it.

663
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:51,791
May be a little off my game here.

664
00:58:58,666 --> 00:58:59,916
Jacob!

665
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,583
Hold on, Maisie!

666
01:01:37,833 --> 01:01:38,833
Maisie.

667
01:01:41,625 --> 01:01:42,708
Maisie?

668
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:44,333
Maisie!

669
01:01:45,291 --> 01:01:46,458
Maisie!

670
01:01:53,583 --> 01:01:54,583
Good boy.

671
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:11,208
We have to go back.

672
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:16,041
- We'll never make it!
- Depends on how fast you can bail.

673
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:27,291
Maybe Red can take us!

674
01:02:27,375 --> 01:02:28,875
Back to the island?

675
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:30,125
No, back home!

676
01:02:30,208 --> 01:02:32,000
You have really lost it.

677
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:34,250
She saved us from that thing, didn't she?

678
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:35,583
Wait... She...

679
01:02:36,208 --> 01:02:37,041
Are you...

680
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:39,416
I think I did the saving, right?

681
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:43,291
I mean, I threw the, the...
Get bailing! The water's coming in!

682
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:47,166
Hey!

683
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:48,250
Red!

684
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:52,166
See this little guy?

685
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,791
This is you.

686
01:02:57,083 --> 01:02:58,625
You're wasting your time.

687
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:00,458
And this is me.

688
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:02,375
And this is him.

689
01:03:04,208 --> 01:03:07,375
Are you putting on a puppet show?
We're sinking here.

690
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:10,000
We need to get way over there.

691
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:13,625
And I wonder
if you might be good enough to take us?

692
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:37,541
Well, if she does understand ya,
she don't wanna help.

693
01:03:37,625 --> 01:03:39,458
Bright side? She didn't eat ya.

694
01:03:39,958 --> 01:03:41,750
Now, get bailing.

695
01:03:54,208 --> 01:03:55,708
Whoa!

696
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:10,958
I told you she was more than a beast!

697
01:04:22,041 --> 01:04:24,000
Woo!

698
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:28,666
The world is wide, Jacob.

699
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:30,708
And you don't know everything.

700
01:04:52,916 --> 01:04:55,916
With the right heading,
we'll be there in three days.

701
01:05:02,166 --> 01:05:05,916
All right, beast.
I need you to turn.

702
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:08,375
Okay? Can you turn?

703
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,791
Can you turn to starboard, yeah?

704
01:05:13,875 --> 01:05:15,000
To the right.

705
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:17,583
Right, ya dumb beast. Right.

706
01:05:17,666 --> 01:05:21,833
- Can you turn to the right? That way!
- You can scream all day.

707
01:05:21,916 --> 01:05:23,458
She don't understand ya.

708
01:05:23,541 --> 01:05:25,333
Oh, she understands, all right.

709
01:05:26,416 --> 01:05:28,583
She's just being monstrous.

710
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:34,708
I need you
to turn to the starboard.

711
01:05:34,791 --> 01:05:38,000
Over there, right where I'm pointing?
That's starboard. That's the right.

712
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:40,875
More to the right.
Look, see? Over there, right!

713
01:05:41,625 --> 01:05:44,083
Turn to the right,
you infernal bloody sea beast!

714
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:48,333
He's wondering if you might turn a smidge.

715
01:05:48,833 --> 01:05:50,541
Like this, see?

716
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:02,458
That's it!

717
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:05,083
Thanks, girl!

718
01:06:12,541 --> 01:06:13,625
Not so hard.

719
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:16,500
She ain't no pet.
Just don't let your guard down, all right?

720
01:06:16,583 --> 01:06:19,916
You can relax, Captain.
She's a friend.

721
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,416
- Yeah, right. Till she gets hungry.
- Oh, will you just...

722
01:06:54,416 --> 01:06:55,416
Hmm.

723
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:11,291
- Is that the Inevitable?
- What are they doing here?

724
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:17,875
Captain!

725
01:08:18,708 --> 01:08:21,916
We don't need this. We're hunters.

726
01:08:22,458 --> 01:08:23,750
Only if we kill it.

727
01:08:53,708 --> 01:08:57,250
I know why you're here, Captain.

728
01:08:57,791 --> 01:09:01,333
It's always the same reason, you see.

729
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:06,541
And I can give you what you need.

730
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:13,291
A poison powerful enough
to take down the greatest of beasts,

731
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:18,041
and a weapon strong enough
to deliver it deep.

732
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:24,041
You know what they say about me, Captain?

733
01:09:24,666 --> 01:09:29,500
Them what come see Gwen Batterbie
get what they want,

734
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:33,083
but won't see a good day after.

735
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:36,500
Yet, here you are.

736
01:09:36,583 --> 01:09:39,083
I don't believe in them superstitions.

737
01:09:40,083 --> 01:09:43,125
No, I don't suppose you do.

738
01:09:45,583 --> 01:09:47,291
But you will.

739
01:09:51,375 --> 01:09:54,375
It's me most terrible creation.

740
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,541
The Hand of God, I calls it.

741
01:09:59,458 --> 01:10:00,708
What will it cost me?

742
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:02,750
Everything, Captain.

743
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:06,291
I take everything.

744
01:10:08,166 --> 01:10:11,458
So, do we have a deal?

745
01:10:34,208 --> 01:10:35,208
Huh?

746
01:11:05,958 --> 01:11:09,833
Yeah, well, you know, I'm, uh...
I'm used to a bigger target, all right?

747
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:31,541
Huh.

748
01:11:43,791 --> 01:11:45,500
Dinner time!

749
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:06,208
It says here that during the dark times,

750
01:13:06,291 --> 01:13:09,333
the beast destroyed a town
on the coast of Kra' Zoul.

751
01:13:09,416 --> 01:13:13,666
But we been up and down that coast,
and I ain't never seen no town,

752
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:15,500
destroyed or otherwise.

753
01:13:16,583 --> 01:13:19,541
A-And... And we don't say "yar"
half this much.

754
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:21,958
E-Every other page, we're shouting "yar."

755
01:13:22,041 --> 01:13:24,250
I mean, this is just nonsense.

756
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:25,583
Says you.

757
01:13:26,541 --> 01:13:28,333
But the book says otherwise,

758
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:31,625
and it's going to outlast both of us.

759
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:36,166
So people will believe
the beasts destroy towns that don't exist,

760
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:38,916
and hunters like to say "yar."

761
01:13:42,875 --> 01:13:44,166
But if that ain't true,

762
01:13:45,916 --> 01:13:48,166
then how are you supposed to know what is?

763
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:49,930
And how do we know the sea beasts

764
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:52,750
ever plucked ladies
out of their veggie patches?

765
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:56,083
That there really were the dark times?

766
01:13:57,333 --> 01:13:59,833
Maybe they didn't start this war.

767
01:14:02,333 --> 01:14:03,333
Maybe, but

768
01:14:03,916 --> 01:14:05,083
why would we?

769
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:22,791
Looks like a real shipwrecker.

770
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,666
Nicer down here, I'd say.

771
01:15:11,375 --> 01:15:12,375
Aye.

772
01:15:12,791 --> 01:15:13,916
Nicer down here.

773
01:16:10,166 --> 01:16:12,791
I don't know how the war started.

774
01:16:15,916 --> 01:16:19,333
Maybe all that matters is how it ends.

775
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:45,000
It's a blood moon.

776
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:47,291
Batterbie's watching.

777
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:50,750
Honor is the currency of hunters, it is.

778
01:16:50,833 --> 01:16:54,333
And dealing with her ain't honorable.

779
01:16:54,416 --> 01:16:56,333
Aye. There'll be a payment due,

780
01:16:56,416 --> 01:16:59,375
and it's the ship
and all aboard who'll suffer the cost.

781
01:17:00,208 --> 01:17:01,291
Sarah!

782
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:06,375
Look there.

783
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:14,333
Riddlebacks.

784
01:17:14,416 --> 01:17:15,416
Aye.

785
01:17:15,875 --> 01:17:17,708
They don't come this far north.

786
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:21,125
Not unless they're swimming
away from something.

787
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:25,416
And there's only one thing
what scares a riddleback.

788
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:26,875
The Bluster.

789
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:40,958
Ms. Merino, shape a new course.
Due south, if you please.

790
01:17:41,041 --> 01:17:42,708
Alee of Rum Pepper Island.

791
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:47,000
Aye, captain.
You heard him! Get it off the pins!

792
01:17:47,583 --> 01:17:49,083
Haul away now!

793
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:50,791
Haul away, all!

794
01:17:52,458 --> 01:17:53,583
We'll find you.

795
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:56,500
We'll find you soon enough.

796
01:18:12,333 --> 01:18:13,708
That ain't you no more.

797
01:18:14,625 --> 01:18:17,500
You're not Jacob Holland
who killed four of them beasts

798
01:18:17,583 --> 01:18:19,166
in a span of two days.

799
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:20,125
It was five.

800
01:18:20,208 --> 01:18:23,416
You're Jacob Holland
who befriended a beast,

801
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,750
saved me life,

802
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:28,416
and led us all the way
to Rum Pepper Island.

803
01:18:30,833 --> 01:18:32,041
We made it.

804
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:39,500
This is as far as Red goes.

805
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:42,500
Won't be safe for her beyond the Dregmorr,

806
01:18:42,583 --> 01:18:44,166
but we can flag a passing ship.

807
01:18:45,708 --> 01:18:46,708
And then what?

808
01:18:48,208 --> 01:18:51,208
Well, then I'll, uh,
take you to Guelston, won't I?

809
01:18:53,625 --> 01:18:56,125
And what about you?

810
01:19:06,583 --> 01:19:08,208
Guelston is a place.

811
01:19:08,291 --> 01:19:09,875
It ain't a family.

812
01:19:10,666 --> 01:19:14,625
I ain't going back there,
and you ain't going back on that ship.

813
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:17,166
So all you have is me.

814
01:19:18,541 --> 01:19:20,125
And all I have is you.

815
01:19:21,291 --> 01:19:22,958
And that don't sound so bad.

816
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,166
So, what do you say?

817
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:34,875
Should we give it a go?

818
01:19:36,666 --> 01:19:37,666
You mean, uh...

819
01:19:38,583 --> 01:19:39,791
You mean, like a family?

820
01:19:40,666 --> 01:19:41,666
Sure.

821
01:19:42,416 --> 01:19:43,458
I-I don't know.

822
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:49,666
Maybe if we pretend long enough,
it could feel real?

823
01:19:53,166 --> 01:19:55,416
Never mind. It's stupid.

824
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:58,875
What, are you picturing us on a farm
or something?

825
01:19:58,958 --> 01:20:00,916
I said "never mind," ya donkey.

826
01:20:01,666 --> 01:20:02,708
So never mind.

827
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:05,750
It's just I-I don't think I'm...

828
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:07,750
You got something in your ears?

829
01:20:07,833 --> 01:20:09,208
All right, all right.

830
01:20:15,333 --> 01:20:18,708
Well, guess, uh, we'd better pack up.

831
01:20:38,541 --> 01:20:42,041
Well, girl, this has been
an improbable adventure.

832
01:20:42,791 --> 01:20:45,291
And I thank you
for all you've done, but, uh,

833
01:20:46,625 --> 01:20:47,958
it's time to go home now.

834
01:20:58,250 --> 01:21:02,416
And I promise
I'll never hunt sea monsters again.

835
01:21:02,916 --> 01:21:05,916
No more monster hunting!

836
01:21:16,125 --> 01:21:17,125
Hang about.

837
01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:19,500
Okay.

838
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:21,458
No more!

839
01:21:25,458 --> 01:21:26,916
No more!

840
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,125
Ow!

841
01:21:28,625 --> 01:21:29,625
Jeez!

842
01:21:30,875 --> 01:21:35,125
Look, you understand
the point I'm trying to make here, right?

843
01:21:35,208 --> 01:21:36,833
It's a... It's a symbolic gesture.

844
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:42,875
I think she understands.

845
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:55,208
All right, then.

846
01:21:55,916 --> 01:21:56,958
Time to go home.

847
01:22:22,125 --> 01:22:24,291
Go on, girl. Go home.

848
01:22:34,041 --> 01:22:35,041
Red?

849
01:22:37,875 --> 01:22:38,875
Red!

850
01:22:45,291 --> 01:22:47,083
Oh no.

851
01:22:57,041 --> 01:22:58,416
Need a hand here.

852
01:23:00,666 --> 01:23:02,500
Red, listen to me.

853
01:23:02,583 --> 01:23:04,000
Just leave.

854
01:23:04,083 --> 01:23:05,750
This doesn't have to be a fight.

855
01:23:12,291 --> 01:23:14,041
No, Red. Go.

856
01:23:14,125 --> 01:23:18,250
- Go on, Red. Just leave them be.
- Red, we have to go. Please!

857
01:23:30,666 --> 01:23:32,416
No, Red! No!

858
01:23:35,083 --> 01:23:37,208
Red! Come back!

859
01:23:37,291 --> 01:23:39,541
All hands, to arms!

860
01:23:39,625 --> 01:23:41,041
Fire away!

861
01:23:48,541 --> 01:23:49,541
Maisie!

862
01:23:52,708 --> 01:23:54,000
No, Red! Stop!

863
01:23:54,625 --> 01:23:55,916
Maisie!

864
01:24:07,958 --> 01:24:08,958
Maisie!

865
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:11,791
Are you all right, lass?

866
01:24:12,833 --> 01:24:14,541
Is Red okay?

867
01:24:17,625 --> 01:24:18,791
Hold fast!

868
01:25:15,291 --> 01:25:18,000
Stay back, beast. Leave her be.

869
01:25:35,083 --> 01:25:36,250
It's the Red Bluster.

870
01:25:36,916 --> 01:25:38,250
The beast is delivered!

871
01:25:48,625 --> 01:25:49,625
No, lass.

872
01:25:50,875 --> 01:25:52,500
There's nothing to be done.

873
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:55,166
She doesn't have to do this.

874
01:25:59,375 --> 01:26:01,583
Yes, she does.

875
01:26:13,833 --> 01:26:15,375
Ready the Hand of God!

876
01:26:42,833 --> 01:26:44,416
Now is the reckoning.

877
01:26:46,916 --> 01:26:49,791
For all who've been lost,

878
01:26:49,875 --> 01:26:52,666
I strike at thee, devil!

879
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:32,500
Don't fight.

880
01:27:32,958 --> 01:27:35,083
You'll make the poison flow faster.

881
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:38,708
I don't want you to die. Not yet.

882
01:27:38,791 --> 01:27:42,541
Not till you've been immortalized
at Castle Whiterock.

883
01:27:49,833 --> 01:27:53,750
Captain, might be wiser
to let the poison finish the job.

884
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:54,833
No, Sarah.

885
01:27:55,416 --> 01:27:57,541
I made a promise to the king and queen.

886
01:28:16,083 --> 01:28:17,166
But I'd not worry.

887
01:28:17,708 --> 01:28:19,541
There's no fight left in it.

888
01:28:23,416 --> 01:28:24,958
Yes, there is.

889
01:28:31,708 --> 01:28:33,791
Raise the studding sails!

890
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:36,208
To starboard, Captain. It's a boat!

891
01:28:36,875 --> 01:28:38,041
Hold!

892
01:28:44,208 --> 01:28:45,416
By the powers...

893
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Jacob.

894
01:29:24,083 --> 01:29:25,166
I see.

895
01:29:26,041 --> 01:29:27,666
That's quite a story, Jacob.

896
01:29:29,125 --> 01:29:32,166
The hunter what befriended a beast. Hmm.

897
01:29:34,125 --> 01:29:36,250
The beast what took me deadlight.

898
01:29:37,416 --> 01:29:39,041
What am I to make of ye, Jacob?

899
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:42,708
That thing and I,

900
01:29:43,458 --> 01:29:44,583
we, uh, had, uh,

901
01:29:46,541 --> 01:29:47,708
an understanding.

902
01:29:47,791 --> 01:29:49,458
A truce. Hmm?

903
01:29:50,458 --> 01:29:52,791
But there cannot be a truce without war.

904
01:29:53,291 --> 01:29:59,375
Whatever happened out there is nothing
against hundreds of years of war.

905
01:30:02,833 --> 01:30:04,541
I've always known what I was, Jacob.

906
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:07,541
I'm the son of a captain,
who was the son of a captain.

907
01:30:07,625 --> 01:30:12,083
And if we are born to fight,
then by God, let's fight.

908
01:30:12,166 --> 01:30:17,458
That we may be tested
and find our greatness.

909
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
So I ask you, Jacob, my son,

910
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:24,333
are you my enemy?

911
01:30:30,375 --> 01:30:32,291
Maisie, stop!

912
01:30:35,083 --> 01:30:36,416
Let her go!

913
01:30:39,333 --> 01:30:41,083
She's all vinegar.

914
01:30:45,583 --> 01:30:48,458
Easy, lass. Easy. There you go.

915
01:30:51,583 --> 01:30:53,791
You need to help Red.

916
01:30:53,875 --> 01:30:55,666
She's our friend.

917
01:30:56,541 --> 01:30:57,791
I'm sorry.

918
01:31:00,041 --> 01:31:01,250
She needs her rest.

919
01:31:01,916 --> 01:31:03,416
I'll get you back to Guelston.

920
01:31:05,041 --> 01:31:06,041
You'll be safe.

921
01:31:06,583 --> 01:31:09,125
You'll have a good, long life.

922
01:31:10,541 --> 01:31:13,208
But first, we'll pay a visit
to Castle Whiterock.

923
01:31:13,916 --> 01:31:16,000
We have a date with the king and queen.

924
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:19,875
Jacob, I imagine you could use a drink.

925
01:31:34,875 --> 01:31:36,333
Welcome home, lad.

926
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Good to see ya.

927
01:31:38,791 --> 01:31:39,875
So good to see you.

928
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:49,958
You're home, Jacob.

929
01:31:50,041 --> 01:31:53,458
Let's toast to the many adventures
that lay ahead of you,

930
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:55,791
as captain of the Inevitable.

931
01:32:19,458 --> 01:32:21,125
You're getting your strength back.

932
01:32:22,208 --> 01:32:23,208
Too late.

933
01:32:24,583 --> 01:32:25,583
Maybe.

934
01:32:27,583 --> 01:32:29,916
It's not right what they're doing to Red.

935
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,458
She saved us.

936
01:32:31,541 --> 01:32:34,375
You have to believe me, please.

937
01:32:36,958 --> 01:32:37,958
I believe you.

938
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:40,291
Then help me stop them.

939
01:32:41,666 --> 01:32:45,375
I've been fighting them beasts
all me life,

940
01:32:45,458 --> 01:32:49,166
and I've seen things
that will never go away.

941
01:32:50,208 --> 01:32:52,041
This ship is all I know.

942
01:32:54,375 --> 01:32:58,458
No first mate
more loyal than Sarah Sharpe.

943
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,791
Crow's done it! He got the Bluster!

944
01:33:44,458 --> 01:33:47,250
The whole world will know
what we've done, me boy.

945
01:33:47,875 --> 01:33:51,416
This ship, your ship, will live on.

946
01:33:52,416 --> 01:33:54,000
Nothing can stop it.

947
01:34:14,958 --> 01:34:17,958
Blue!

948
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:21,583
Let's see a cat do that.

949
01:34:21,666 --> 01:34:23,041
Open the gate!

950
01:34:53,375 --> 01:34:54,791
It was them!

951
01:35:04,125 --> 01:35:05,125
Oh, girl.

952
01:35:16,416 --> 01:35:19,000
Don't worry, Red.
I-I'll get you out of here.

953
01:35:46,708 --> 01:35:47,958
What is all this?

954
01:35:48,041 --> 01:35:50,416
Why is everyone...

955
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:59,291
He's done it! He's got the Red Bluster!

956
01:36:03,416 --> 01:36:06,041
- That'll do, Ms. Merino.
- You heard the captain.

957
01:36:06,125 --> 01:36:07,125
Drop anchor.

958
01:36:21,666 --> 01:36:23,666
Captain Crow.

959
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:28,208
Well, it looks like we have our winner.

960
01:36:28,291 --> 01:36:30,750
When I last visited Whiterock,

961
01:36:30,833 --> 01:36:35,791
you told me
that the days of hunters were over.

962
01:36:35,875 --> 01:36:39,666
But the Imperator
was no match for the beast.

963
01:36:50,375 --> 01:36:53,041
All of your wealth and power,

964
01:36:53,125 --> 01:36:58,916
all of this is nothing
compared to a hunter's fury.

965
01:37:04,125 --> 01:37:07,291
And it's the Inevitable
what will lead the way

966
01:37:08,333 --> 01:37:10,875
into the Dregmorr and beyond.

967
01:37:13,041 --> 01:37:17,291
Until the bones
of every one of them beasts

968
01:37:17,375 --> 01:37:19,500
lies at the bottom of the sea!

969
01:37:22,333 --> 01:37:23,333
Captain!

970
01:37:29,583 --> 01:37:30,583
Jacob,

971
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:32,708
get back on the ship.

972
01:37:33,625 --> 01:37:34,833
I can't let you do it.

973
01:37:36,833 --> 01:37:38,208
You dishonor me, boy.

974
01:37:38,958 --> 01:37:41,916
As you dishonor all them hunters
what come before.

975
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,625
All them what died heroes.

976
01:37:45,208 --> 01:37:47,333
Aye, they were heroes.

977
01:37:49,166 --> 01:37:50,416
But you can be a hero

978
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:52,291
and still be wrong.

979
01:37:56,166 --> 01:37:58,291
Now give me the lance.

980
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:01,583
I thought of you as a son.

981
01:38:02,625 --> 01:38:05,416
But I don't know you.

982
01:38:11,833 --> 01:38:13,125
I gave you everything!

983
01:38:14,583 --> 01:38:15,875
I gave you life!

984
01:38:18,541 --> 01:38:20,625
You've laid down your lance

985
01:38:20,708 --> 01:38:23,125
and think it's made you strong?

986
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:28,416
But you've turned your back
on your own kind.

987
01:38:38,541 --> 01:38:39,875
- Jacob!
- Jacob!

988
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:02,416
I should have given you a bigger knife.

989
01:39:06,833 --> 01:39:08,958
Oh!

990
01:39:11,833 --> 01:39:12,875
Whoa!

991
01:39:48,416 --> 01:39:52,083
The hunters brought the beast
to the very heart of our kingdom.

992
01:39:52,166 --> 01:39:54,666
For your queen, for all that is good,

993
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:56,083
strike it down!

994
01:39:56,166 --> 01:39:58,791
Cannoneers! Take position!

995
01:40:18,833 --> 01:40:21,125
Prepare to fire!

996
01:40:42,083 --> 01:40:43,833
Out of our way, you fools!

997
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,083
Stop!

998
01:41:32,375 --> 01:41:35,708
If you do this, it never ends.

999
01:42:00,958 --> 01:42:04,750
No more monster hunting!

1000
01:42:21,416 --> 01:42:22,583
Impossible.

1001
01:42:44,583 --> 01:42:45,958
You did good, kid.

1002
01:42:47,333 --> 01:42:48,333
I ain't done.

1003
01:43:03,833 --> 01:43:04,875
Our books,

1004
01:43:06,208 --> 01:43:07,500
our history,

1005
01:43:08,458 --> 01:43:09,458
is a lie.

1006
01:43:12,541 --> 01:43:15,708
I don't believe the beasts
ever threatened our shores.

1007
01:43:16,208 --> 01:43:17,958
It was just a story.

1008
01:43:18,916 --> 01:43:21,041
A story told by them!

1009
01:43:21,125 --> 01:43:22,500
What?

1010
01:43:27,416 --> 01:43:31,958
For generations,
they've taught us to hate the beasts

1011
01:43:32,625 --> 01:43:35,750
and sent the hunters out to destroy them.

1012
01:43:35,833 --> 01:43:39,958
And the beasts learned
to fear us and hate us,

1013
01:43:40,041 --> 01:43:42,375
and they fought back!

1014
01:43:42,458 --> 01:43:46,041
Who are you to malign
your king and queen with such falsehoods?

1015
01:43:46,125 --> 01:43:47,958
You have no right to speak!

1016
01:43:48,041 --> 01:43:50,041
I have every right!

1017
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:58,125
I come from a long line of hunters
that died your great death!

1018
01:43:59,083 --> 01:44:01,791
Your kingdom was paid for
with their blood,

1019
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:03,833
and their blood!

1020
01:44:03,916 --> 01:44:07,166
Enough! General, give the command.

1021
01:44:10,625 --> 01:44:14,916
This war was started
by the kings and queens what come before.

1022
01:44:15,416 --> 01:44:18,666
And with every lie, their empire grew.

1023
01:44:19,625 --> 01:44:25,041
Now this lot stands on the same perch
and tells the same lies.

1024
01:44:26,416 --> 01:44:27,708
For their greed.

1025
01:44:28,916 --> 01:44:29,916
General!

1026
01:44:34,458 --> 01:44:35,958
Let it end.

1027
01:44:36,958 --> 01:44:38,750
Let it end!

1028
01:44:41,958 --> 01:44:43,208
Listen to her!

1029
01:44:44,916 --> 01:44:46,333
Let the beast go!

1030
01:44:57,500 --> 01:44:59,541
Listen to the child!

1031
01:45:04,791 --> 01:45:05,833
Now I'm done.

1032
01:45:11,250 --> 01:45:12,250
All right, Red.

1033
01:45:12,958 --> 01:45:13,958
We best go.

1034
01:45:19,166 --> 01:45:20,666
What are you doing?

1035
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:21,625
Fire!

1036
01:45:21,708 --> 01:45:23,750
Your queen demands it!

1037
01:45:26,541 --> 01:45:30,083
General, shouldn't we fire?

1038
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:37,000
My brother was on the Monarch, Sergeant.

1039
01:45:43,625 --> 01:45:46,291
And I want to know how this war started.

1040
01:45:55,208 --> 01:45:56,708
That hurt, didn't it?

1041
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,750
You have no idea.

1042
01:46:25,375 --> 01:46:27,333
<i>Two lives were saved that day.</i>

1043
01:46:28,166 --> 01:46:30,333
<i>One man and one beast.</i>

1044
01:46:31,041 --> 01:46:33,916
<i>And with that, the world began to change.</i>

1045
01:46:36,333 --> 01:46:38,833
<i>No ship would ever sail
the Dregmorr again.</i>

1046
01:46:39,833 --> 01:46:42,875
<i>And the mysteries beyond
would remain undisturbed.</i>

1047
01:46:49,666 --> 01:46:51,833
<i>I don't think
about it much though.</i>

1048
01:46:52,416 --> 01:46:57,750
<i>Red is safe,
and I have everything I need right here.</i>

1049
01:47:09,791 --> 01:47:12,875
