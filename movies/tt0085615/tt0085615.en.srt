2
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,294
- Who found them?
- He did.

3
00:03:15,545 --> 00:03:19,716
He was on patrol,
he left the path for a pee and...

4
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,511
- Uh-oh.
- Three lost souls.

5
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:28,849
Like an execution, Pasha.
How long have they been here?

6
00:03:28,932 --> 00:03:30,642
Arkady.

7
00:03:35,272 --> 00:03:40,069
Greetings, comrades.
I bring you hot-water bottles.

8
00:03:41,904 --> 00:03:45,824
Good. We were wondering
why you came, Comrade Major Pribluda.

9
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:50,787
This is a matter for militia. There's no
reason to think state security's involved.

10
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,290
What interest is this to KGB?

11
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:57,710
KGB decides what interests KGB.

12
00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:02,382
So, who are they?
What's it look like? Drunks, or what?

13
00:04:02,507 --> 00:04:07,720
If you want the case, Major, welcome.
We militia can go back to our beds.

14
00:04:07,804 --> 00:04:10,515
I wonder you ever left them.

15
00:04:21,316 --> 00:04:25,445
Comrade Major,
you're disturbing the evidence.

16
00:04:32,703 --> 00:04:34,996
Holy Mother.

17
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:38,916
Look at this.

18
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:47,299
Look.

19
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:51,095
No face. Sliced right off.

20
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,347
Good God.

21
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:08,319
This one too. Butchered.

22
00:05:08,445 --> 00:05:10,739
Jesus.

23
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:23,668
Faceless.

24
00:05:24,836 --> 00:05:27,046
All three of them.

25
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:30,049
Who are they?

26
00:05:30,132 --> 00:05:34,053
- You've disturbed enough evidence.
- Oh, stop complaining.

27
00:05:34,136 --> 00:05:37,139
I've done some of the dirty work for you.

28
00:05:37,848 --> 00:05:41,602
Yes, I know. You always do, comrade.

29
00:05:44,605 --> 00:05:48,108
One day, Renko, this could be you.

30
00:05:49,985 --> 00:05:54,447
Let's leave these policemen to it.
The cold has made them inhospitable.

31
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,741
Comrade Major?

32
00:06:01,913 --> 00:06:04,749
Are you sure you want
militia to investigate this?

33
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:08,878
- What do you mean?
- It does seem like a KGB case after all.

34
00:06:09,003 --> 00:06:13,883
Bodies carved up in the middle of
Moscow. Who knows where it could lead?

35
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,103
A body this size stays like stone for days.

36
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:28,897
I'd say they'd been there
three weeks to a month.

37
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,484
I'm about to make an incision
into the chest wall.

38
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:37,906
- This is disturbing you?
- Well, I'm glad I had no breakfast.

39
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,450
Sorry. I'm used to dealing with the dead.

40
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:47,581
The only emotion I feel about one is
a faint hope it may be a party official.

41
00:06:48,624 --> 00:06:52,294
Be careful, my friend.
You don't want this case.

42
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,506
Please. You don't want this case.

43
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,011
How were they killed,
Comrade Chief Pathologist?

44
00:07:04,222 --> 00:07:07,559
The two men were shot in the head
at contact range.

45
00:07:07,642 --> 00:07:10,729
All three were shot in the chest.

46
00:07:10,854 --> 00:07:13,857
They were all in their twenties.

47
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,734
Go on.

48
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:21,031
Arkady, whoever cut off their faces knew
what he was doing. He was an expert.

49
00:07:21,114 --> 00:07:25,410
- And who are the experts, Levin?
- I'm not listening.

50
00:07:25,535 --> 00:07:30,080
They were there as soon as we were,
Pribluda and his gang. Who told them?

51
00:07:30,164 --> 00:07:33,834
You've got an informer
in your office, haven't you?

52
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:36,420
Anything else for me?

53
00:07:36,545 --> 00:07:40,466
The smaller male dyed his hair.
Its natural colour is red.

54
00:07:40,591 --> 00:07:43,594
Possible indication of antisocial activity.

55
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:46,472
Or maybe he was a black marketeer.

56
00:07:46,597 --> 00:07:49,266
Or...

57
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:53,019
- Or a foreigner.
- Arkady, please.

58
00:07:53,102 --> 00:07:55,772
I don't like to get
mixed up with KGB work.

59
00:07:55,855 --> 00:08:00,318
Don't worry. If one of these really is a
foreigner, it's out of our hands anyway.

60
00:08:00,443 --> 00:08:05,239
I've just got to find enough
to make KGB take over the case.

61
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:10,828
And the quicker I can do that,
the safer we'll all feel.

62
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:18,543
Chest incision!

63
00:08:37,646 --> 00:08:41,232
I can't understand it, lamskoy.
Dead bodies in Gorky Park.

64
00:08:41,357 --> 00:08:45,736
- What the hell are they doing there?
- Yes, it passes belief, General.

65
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:48,614
Chief Investigator Renko
reporting, General.

66
00:08:48,739 --> 00:08:51,826
- Have you shaved this morning?
- Comrade General, I...

67
00:08:51,909 --> 00:08:57,039
- The general wants to know your initial...
- A fellow should keep hair off his face.

68
00:08:57,123 --> 00:09:01,419
Your initial reaction to this. What are
the prospects for an early resolution?

69
00:09:01,502 --> 00:09:05,423
With the world's finest militia
and the support of the Soviet peoples,

70
00:09:05,547 --> 00:09:09,676
I am confident we will apprehend the
criminals involved, Comrade General.

71
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:14,222
Yes, yes, yes. I hope so, young man.
Your father, General Renko,

72
00:09:14,347 --> 00:09:19,060
he was always clean and tidy,
even when he was killing Germans.

73
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:23,773
It's nearly four hours since the three
bodies were uncovered. Who are they?

74
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:27,485
The bodies have no marks
of identification, Comrade Prosecutor.

75
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,612
What? No papers? Here in Moscow?

76
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:35,743
The bodies were badly mutilated.
No papers. No fingertips.

77
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,703
No faces.

78
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:41,290
They were clean-shaven,
General. Quite literally.

79
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,585
Well...

80
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:50,049
Your father was just as insolent,
but then he could afford to be.

81
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:53,260
He was very good at his job, Renko.

82
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:14,530
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

83
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,450
For God's sake, Yuri,
can't you concentrate?

84
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,577
Your button, man. Your tunic button.

85
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:23,789
It's hanging off. Wardrobe!

86
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:27,626
Irina! Irina, please.

87
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,463
OK, let's set up again from the top.

88
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:37,135
Remember, you're tired, you're
frightened, Napoleon has you on the run.

89
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,013
Be careful, Misha.

90
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:44,975
- Show me that barn door again.
- Opening positions, everybody.

91
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:48,396
Quiet, please. Let's get ready to do this.

92
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:52,316
Ready to roll.

93
00:10:56,028 --> 00:11:00,241
What does a chief investigator
want with me?

94
00:11:00,366 --> 00:11:03,869
We found your skates.
Your name was scratched on them.

95
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:07,415
Oh, those. I lost them months ago.

96
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:12,836
You reported them missing on February 4
but said you lost them on January 31.

97
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:15,588
You didn't know
they were missing for four days?

98
00:11:15,672 --> 00:11:20,385
That's how it is. You don't
miss something till you need it.

99
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:24,681
- They were found on a dead girl.
- There is justice after all.

100
00:11:27,308 --> 00:11:32,980
Please, don't be shocked. You've no idea
how long it took to save for those skates.

101
00:11:33,063 --> 00:11:35,774
Look at my boots. See?

102
00:11:36,734 --> 00:11:38,777
Split.

103
00:11:38,902 --> 00:11:43,032
She was murdered.
The girl wearing your skates.

104
00:11:43,157 --> 00:11:48,037
The director of that film promised me
new boots if I went to bed with him.

105
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,956
Think I should?

106
00:11:51,081 --> 00:11:53,709
Winter is almost over.

107
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:58,129
Exactly. And me a Siberian.
I am used to the cold.

108
00:12:02,842 --> 00:12:05,595
Is your heart cold too?

109
00:12:05,678 --> 00:12:06,763
What?

110
00:12:06,888 --> 00:12:11,017
The girl wearing your skates,
about your age.

111
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,564
Two others were found with her,
also murdered. Their faces were cut off.

112
00:12:16,647 --> 00:12:20,318
What has this to do with me?
What do you want?

113
00:12:20,443 --> 00:12:23,320
Think back. Any idea
who took your skates?

114
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:27,824
I suspect everyone.

115
00:12:27,949 --> 00:12:30,160
So do I.

116
00:12:38,251 --> 00:12:40,295
Well?

117
00:12:41,505 --> 00:12:44,675
Are you going to arrest me
for losing my skates?

118
00:12:46,092 --> 00:12:48,719
- Perhaps not.
- Good.

119
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:51,681
Then please leave me alone.

120
00:13:04,568 --> 00:13:06,696
It's cold. We've been skating,

121
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:10,949
but we've left the skating paths
for the clearing. Why?

122
00:13:11,074 --> 00:13:13,618
- To talk.
- To eat. It's why anyone goes skating.

123
00:13:13,743 --> 00:13:16,496
To stop, have a meat pie,
pass around the vodka.

124
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:22,585
So I've brought food. There's vodka in
our bellies. We're feeling good, relaxed.

125
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,714
Then...

126
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,925
- You shoot from your pocket.
- Shoot your own foot that way.

127
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:33,638
Forensic found traces of leather
in the bullet wounds.

128
00:13:33,762 --> 00:13:38,976
A bag. You brought the food
in a leather bag with the gun.

129
00:13:41,895 --> 00:13:44,356
We're friends.

130
00:13:44,481 --> 00:13:47,109
Enjoying ourselves.

131
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:50,529
We leave the paths for a secluded place.

132
00:13:51,488 --> 00:13:54,325
We are all alone.

133
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:59,704
I am handing out the food from the bag.

134
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,586
And I don't suspect a thing
as you lift the bag close to my chest.

135
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:10,882
What about the noise? Wouldn't the
other two call out? Wouldn't they run?

136
00:14:10,965 --> 00:14:15,178
- Well, they don't know what's happening.
- But the noise!

137
00:14:15,261 --> 00:14:17,138
Hey!

138
00:14:17,388 --> 00:14:19,265
Hey!

139
00:14:27,648 --> 00:14:29,941
The noise would make them run. It...

140
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:41,995
What? What did you say?

141
00:14:51,295 --> 00:14:55,299
- You know what you just did?
- We're missing something.

142
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:59,387
- Yes, you went through a red light.
- Concentrate. No fingertips, no face.

143
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:04,517
Why? To make identification difficult. But
the killer shoots the two men in the head.

144
00:15:04,642 --> 00:15:07,478
- Why?
- And he risks making even more noise.

145
00:15:07,561 --> 00:15:13,566
Yes, but if he sliced off their faces, what's
the point of shooting them in the mouth?

146
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:16,319
- What do you have in your mouth?
- My tongue.

147
00:15:16,403 --> 00:15:19,322
Your teeth.

148
00:15:19,406 --> 00:15:21,616
Your teeth!

149
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:32,168
Gutta-percha.

150
00:15:32,293 --> 00:15:35,713
- He had root-canal work, the redhead.
- Meaning?

151
00:15:35,838 --> 00:15:40,884
Dentists in Europe don't use gutta-percha,
only the Americans.

152
00:15:45,764 --> 00:15:47,725
Finally, and overwhelmingly,

153
00:15:47,808 --> 00:15:52,688
the dental technique suggests
that the victim is an American.

154
00:15:54,023 --> 00:15:56,400
Arkady.

155
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:58,652
Would you...?

156
00:16:01,946 --> 00:16:04,324
Excited, are we?

157
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:07,410
I think we've got enough
to dump this case.

158
00:16:07,493 --> 00:16:10,371
I've just seen the report from Ballistics.

159
00:16:10,455 --> 00:16:14,834
- What weapon?
- It's a 7.65mm pistol.

160
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:17,795
And that's a KGB gun.

161
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:21,049
Is it that shithead Pribluda?

162
00:16:21,174 --> 00:16:25,302
That's like asking if a girl's a virgin when
I see her in bed with a man on top of her.

163
00:16:25,427 --> 00:16:27,721
Well, what man?

164
00:16:28,597 --> 00:16:30,891
Oh!

165
00:16:34,853 --> 00:16:40,400
- Am I missing a joke?
- It's about your friend, Major Pribluda.

166
00:16:40,484 --> 00:16:43,904
What do you mean, "my friend"?

167
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:46,907
What is it?

168
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,533
I've been asked to lamskoy's dacha.

169
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:52,870
He's throwing a weekend party
and he wants to talk to me.

170
00:16:52,953 --> 00:16:57,750
- That's a great honour, Comrade Renko.
- Well, well, well.

171
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,586
You'll have to tidy yourself up.

172
00:17:02,004 --> 00:17:03,798
What?

173
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:07,593
Oh, yes.

174
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:44,086
Well, well. A weekend at the lamskoys'.

175
00:17:44,211 --> 00:17:48,924
Now, is it because your father
was a hero of the Soviet army? No.

176
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:52,636
God knows, it can hardly be
because of your charm or elegance.

177
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,099
Not all weekend, Anton. Just today,
long enough to get our host into a corner.

178
00:17:57,182 --> 00:17:59,476
So... what are you up to?

179
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,186
- I'm saving a life.
- Whose?

180
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:06,316
Mine. I'm on a case that reeks of KGB
involvement and I've got to be extra...

181
00:18:06,441 --> 00:18:09,277
Wouldn't you two
rather have good Soviet vodka?

182
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,280
No, Natasha, wicked French wine will do.

183
00:18:15,575 --> 00:18:17,702
Who is that?

184
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:23,958
That is Jack Osborne.
An American.

185
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,626
He comes here
to buy our sable pelts.

186
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,796
Well, it is the only place
you can get them.

187
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:36,762
They say the Kremlin uses him to take
messages to and from Washington.

188
00:18:36,845 --> 00:18:39,056
He's a very big wheel.

189
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:42,434
He even had dinner
with Brezhnev before he died.

190
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,190
Well, perhaps the conversation
would have been better after he'd died.

191
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:51,025
Anton.

192
00:19:03,454 --> 00:19:08,250
The Ancient Greeks
understood the mechanics of power.

193
00:19:08,334 --> 00:19:13,798
"Justice" they said. "Justice is
in the interests of the strong."

194
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:18,843
I've heard the same sentiment expressed
in not-too-dissimilar terms in America.

195
00:19:18,927 --> 00:19:22,973
"Those were the gold-maker rules"
someone said.

196
00:19:23,556 --> 00:19:28,186
You mean in America only
those with money can be innocent?

197
00:19:28,311 --> 00:19:33,650
No. I mean in America, attorneys
do very well for themselves.

198
00:19:34,442 --> 00:19:39,322
Well, do you know what you're doing here
when you engage a defence lawyer?

199
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:41,865
Wasting money.

200
00:19:57,673 --> 00:20:00,592
I read your report, Arkady.

201
00:20:00,718 --> 00:20:05,763
And I can see that you are anxious
for the KGB to take over the case.

202
00:20:05,847 --> 00:20:10,059
But this is not like you, huh?
Why? What's wrong?

203
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:13,896
- May I speak freely?
- To me? Always.

204
00:20:14,022 --> 00:20:19,235
It is more than possible
that KGB killed those three people.

205
00:20:25,908 --> 00:20:28,119
I agree.

206
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:31,872
Then it is likely they are
laying a trap for me.

207
00:20:31,955 --> 00:20:33,123
Why?

208
00:20:33,248 --> 00:20:36,918
Once I tried to arrest Major Pribluda.
I proved he was an assassin.

209
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:41,548
- Remember the two bodies by the river?
- God, it's cold out here.

210
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:47,095
- You want to freeze my blood even more?
- I proved KGB did it.

211
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:52,683
I moved for the indictment,
and I was arrested and beaten senseless.

212
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:54,644
And who got you out?

213
00:20:54,727 --> 00:20:59,106
I was grateful to you. I am grateful to you.
But it's a poisonous farce.

214
00:20:59,231 --> 00:21:01,901
Arkady, things are changing.

215
00:21:01,984 --> 00:21:04,987
Believe me, I have more power
than used to be the case.

216
00:21:05,071 --> 00:21:07,907
They are more vulnerable.

217
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:11,577
You're easily
the best policeman in Moscow.

218
00:21:12,828 --> 00:21:16,582
And I need your help. I need it badly.

219
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:20,001
And you can protect me and my men?

220
00:21:21,252 --> 00:21:25,465
Listen, our Soviet constitution
is a noble piece of work.

221
00:21:26,466 --> 00:21:30,470
But only if honourable men
and women respect it.

222
00:21:30,553 --> 00:21:33,640
Now, I'm determined to stand on legality.

223
00:21:33,723 --> 00:21:39,896
KGB must not, cannot work outside the
law, or they're little better than the CIA.

224
00:21:40,021 --> 00:21:44,483
- But how?
- Support me. Don't try to unload the case.

225
00:21:44,608 --> 00:21:48,445
We mustn't give them a centimetre.
And I promise you, Arkady...

226
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:52,324
I promise you, I'll be behind you
every step of the way.

227
00:21:55,452 --> 00:21:57,246
Yes, my dear?

228
00:21:57,329 --> 00:22:00,749
You are the only one here
who is going back to Moscow tonight.

229
00:22:00,874 --> 00:22:03,794
- It seems so.
- Will you take me with you?

230
00:22:03,877 --> 00:22:07,547
- At this hour? Is there something wrong?
- Please?

231
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:11,801
You'd better first persuade Mr Osborne
to give you a fur coat, my dear.

232
00:22:11,884 --> 00:22:14,971
The investigator's car has no heater.

233
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:35,073
Not the sort of place a girl without a
decent pair of boots normally goes, is it?

234
00:22:35,157 --> 00:22:38,660
Won't your rich American friend
be disappointed?

235
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,080
I asked you for a lift, not a conversation.

236
00:22:42,164 --> 00:22:45,500
What, still upset
about a pair of lost skates?

237
00:22:45,626 --> 00:22:49,546
- If they were lost.
- I reported them missing.

238
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,256
- Yes, but why?
- What?

239
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:57,345
You're not the sort who goes to the police
for a thing like that without a reason.

240
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:03,559
Were you afraid they might
turn up on the wrong person?

241
00:23:03,684 --> 00:23:05,728
- Let me out.
- What?

242
00:23:06,771 --> 00:23:12,610
- Stop and let me out. I'd rather walk.
- Don't be silly. You'd freeze to death.

243
00:23:13,277 --> 00:23:18,865
What are you doing? You're insane!
What are you trying to do? Kill yourself?

244
00:23:18,949 --> 00:23:21,409
Questions, questions.

245
00:23:23,286 --> 00:23:27,457
Oh, no. Fine, fine.
Now we can both freeze.

246
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:31,753
Come on.

247
00:23:48,018 --> 00:23:50,729
KGB have better cars, you know.

248
00:23:50,813 --> 00:23:54,858
But they don't always take you
where you want to go, do they?

249
00:25:11,432 --> 00:25:15,269
I don't know whether to get deep
in this case or not. Really take it on.

250
00:25:15,394 --> 00:25:18,814
- Don't piss into the wind.
- Maybe. Maybe not. Forensic?

251
00:25:18,898 --> 00:25:23,610
Forensic picked up traces of gesso,
sawdust and gold on the clothing.

252
00:25:23,693 --> 00:25:26,237
- Gold?
- All used in the restoring of icons.

253
00:25:26,363 --> 00:25:31,493
Black marketeers. That's why the KGB
disposed of them. Sodding Pribluda.

254
00:25:31,618 --> 00:25:34,621
Anything else?
Did Forensic turn up anything else?

255
00:25:34,746 --> 00:25:37,832
Yeah, some spots
of chicken and fish blood.

256
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:40,752
That's odd, isn't it?

257
00:25:40,835 --> 00:25:43,380
That doesn't fit.

258
00:25:44,422 --> 00:25:47,508
God, I wish we knew
what they looked like.

259
00:25:49,551 --> 00:25:51,178
Hm.

260
00:25:52,012 --> 00:25:54,723
No dessert?

261
00:26:03,732 --> 00:26:07,236
- And the redhead. I want his head too.
- Why not the other one?

262
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:11,656
We know nothing about him. Besides,
how many do you think I can carry?

263
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:15,576
So long as you know what to say
if they stop you in the street.

264
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:20,915
The greatest of killers.

265
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,917
I'm sorry?

266
00:26:23,042 --> 00:26:25,253
Tamerlane the Great.

267
00:26:25,336 --> 00:26:29,382
Nasty man. His skull
showed right-side paralysis,

268
00:26:29,507 --> 00:26:32,051
and I had some hair to deal with.

269
00:26:32,135 --> 00:26:34,886
Yes, I see.

270
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:38,181
Do you? Do you?

271
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:39,558
Well...

272
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:42,144
What about the mildew?

273
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:48,317
On the upper lip?

274
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:52,571
- Yes. I'm sorry, what do you mean?
- Where the moustache grew. Mildew.

275
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:54,740
Of course.

276
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:59,827
- I am Professor Andreev.
- Chief Investigator Renko. I tried to ring...

277
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:05,666
I do not do forensic work,
either for militia or KGB.

278
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,504
Renko?

279
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,840
- How interesting.
- Why?

280
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:17,303
Your father was General Renko.
You don't look a bit like him.

281
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:23,016
My God. Your zygomaticus has a
completely different elasticity altogether.

282
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:28,980
Promise me I can have your face
when the breath has left your body.

283
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:35,153
Professor Andreev,
these heads have no faces.

284
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:48,123
- Don't try to interest me.
- A murderer erased their identities.

285
00:27:48,207 --> 00:27:51,210
You can give it back to them.

286
00:28:08,477 --> 00:28:14,399
Professor, too many people
in our society disappear without trace.

287
00:28:14,857 --> 00:28:16,234
Oh?

288
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:18,319
Why is that?

289
00:28:18,403 --> 00:28:20,697
They fall into a chasm.

290
00:28:21,906 --> 00:28:24,033
What sort of chasm?

291
00:28:24,158 --> 00:28:27,161
The one between what is said
and what is done.

292
00:28:32,292 --> 00:28:37,671
You may not be long for this world,
my fine, imprudent fellow.

293
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,560
Hm.

294
00:28:51,685 --> 00:28:55,689
Right. First thing:
Clean off the rest of the flesh. Hm?

295
00:28:56,315 --> 00:28:58,775
Fetch me the grubworms.

296
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:38,563
# Whoa, where you're concerned,
my heart I sold

297
00:29:38,647 --> 00:29:41,900
# It's so easy to fall in love

298
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:45,070
# It's so easy to fall in love

299
00:29:52,284 --> 00:29:55,537
- # It seems so easy
- # It's so easy, it's so easy, it's so easy

300
00:29:55,621 --> 00:29:59,375
- # So doggone easy
- # Doggone easy, doggone easy

301
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:02,795
- # It seems so easy
- # It's so easy, it's so easy, it's so easy

302
00:30:02,878 --> 00:30:07,091
# Where you're concerned my heart I sold

303
00:30:07,174 --> 00:30:10,344
# It's so easy to fall in love

304
00:30:10,552 --> 00:30:13,972
# It's so easy to fall in love

305
00:30:17,934 --> 00:30:20,395
Let's go. All right?

306
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:38,203
- # Well shake it up, baby, now
- # Shake it up, baby

307
00:30:38,287 --> 00:30:41,206
- # Twist and shout
- # Twist and shout

308
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,750
# Come on, come on,
come on, come on, baby, now

309
00:30:43,834 --> 00:30:46,920
- # Come on, baby
- # Come on and work it on out...

310
00:30:47,004 --> 00:30:48,463
Hey.

311
00:30:48,588 --> 00:30:51,049
Who are you?

312
00:30:52,676 --> 00:30:55,345
What are you doing there?

313
00:30:56,597 --> 00:31:00,809
I said, what are you doing there?
This is a...

314
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:03,352
Stop! Militia!

315
00:31:55,194 --> 00:31:57,321
Son of a bitch!

316
00:32:01,283 --> 00:32:03,327
Stay away.

317
00:32:07,581 --> 00:32:09,625
An American.

318
00:33:03,969 --> 00:33:06,012
Arkady?

319
00:33:07,263 --> 00:33:09,140
Ah.

320
00:33:09,932 --> 00:33:13,185
Who did it? What happened?

321
00:33:13,311 --> 00:33:15,521
Was it Pribluda? Arkady?

322
00:33:15,605 --> 00:33:17,898
No, no.

323
00:33:17,982 --> 00:33:20,359
I think it was an American.

324
00:33:20,443 --> 00:33:22,486
Christ.

325
00:33:22,612 --> 00:33:25,156
CIA, you think?

326
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,658
Somebody with fists made of stone.

327
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:33,663
- More painkiller?
- Mmmm.

328
00:33:39,544 --> 00:33:42,464
What are we doing in the kitchen?
You should lie down.

329
00:33:42,589 --> 00:33:46,092
This is where you keep
your French brandy.

330
00:33:53,349 --> 00:33:56,769
The way to do this is to imagine

331
00:33:56,894 --> 00:33:59,813
they are your loved one...

332
00:34:01,231 --> 00:34:03,943
these little creatures.

333
00:34:05,486 --> 00:34:08,155
Oh, yes, we need them.

334
00:34:08,238 --> 00:34:11,992
Don't the ones you love eat up your flesh?

335
00:38:11,138 --> 00:38:16,268
"A member of the Komsomol brigade,
Valerya Davidova,

336
00:38:16,352 --> 00:38:19,063
demonstrates a pelt
of a Barguzinsky sable

337
00:38:19,146 --> 00:38:25,151
to visiting American... businessman...
Jack Osborne."

338
00:38:34,702 --> 00:38:37,163
And who's this?

339
00:38:37,247 --> 00:38:39,207
A redhead?

340
00:39:51,234 --> 00:39:54,070
It's rainin' outside,
in case you hadn't noticed.

341
00:39:54,154 --> 00:39:56,448
Close the door.

342
00:40:02,536 --> 00:40:04,246
No.

343
00:40:04,371 --> 00:40:06,665
Throw it to my feet.

344
00:40:10,794 --> 00:40:13,631
Empty your pockets on the bed.

345
00:40:17,927 --> 00:40:20,679
Now take your coat off.

346
00:40:20,804 --> 00:40:23,514
Throw it to the floor.

347
00:40:30,647 --> 00:40:32,941
Trouser pockets.

348
00:40:34,484 --> 00:40:37,278
- You're all alone, aren't you, Boris?
- Be still.

349
00:40:37,362 --> 00:40:39,239
- What?
- Don't move.

350
00:40:39,322 --> 00:40:43,368
Easy, Boris. Easy, easy.
It's my room. Why should I move?

351
00:40:43,451 --> 00:40:45,495
Sit.

352
00:40:48,038 --> 00:40:50,082
Easy.

353
00:40:57,005 --> 00:40:59,383
Now tie your laces together.

354
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:21,696
What you gonna do now?
Pile the furniture on me?

355
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,406
If need be.

356
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:26,242
I should have killed you in the park.

357
00:41:26,325 --> 00:41:28,202
Why?

358
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:33,207
- Cos that's where you killed my brother.
- Your brother?

359
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:36,501
So that's why...

360
00:41:37,043 --> 00:41:39,004
I didn't kill him.

361
00:41:39,087 --> 00:41:44,467
You or your friends. Makes no difference.
But you're the one that will pay for it.

362
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:50,849
A policeman from New York?

363
00:41:50,932 --> 00:41:54,102
That's a gold shield, Boris. I'm a detective.

364
00:41:54,185 --> 00:41:56,646
A detective? Lose your way, did you?

365
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:00,317
- I found you, didn't I?
- I didn't kill your brother.

366
00:42:00,399 --> 00:42:04,612
But how are you gonna find the one
who did it? Or doesn't that matter?

367
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:10,910
I think you'll need a bit of help.

368
00:42:24,881 --> 00:42:28,801
Tell me about the girl
in the newspaper cutting.

369
00:42:28,927 --> 00:42:32,597
She was a friend of your brother's.
Perhaps she was killed with him.

370
00:42:32,722 --> 00:42:35,433
Ask your comrades in the secret police.

371
00:42:35,516 --> 00:42:38,853
No. Perhaps KGB did kill them.

372
00:42:38,937 --> 00:42:41,940
But I want to find the killer.

373
00:42:42,023 --> 00:42:46,569
But I need help. Why don't we
help each other, Mr Kirwill?

374
00:42:47,737 --> 00:42:53,325
Sure. You on the outside and me on the
inside, looking at you through the bars.

375
00:42:55,452 --> 00:42:57,496
A deal.

376
00:42:58,872 --> 00:43:01,583
I won't arrest you.

377
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:04,586
You help me. How about it?

378
00:43:06,546 --> 00:43:09,091
Go fuck yourself.

379
00:43:26,899 --> 00:43:31,028
Wait a minute. How about my shield?
I'm gonna need that.

380
00:43:33,114 --> 00:43:35,575
Not here, you won't.

381
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:42,289
VALERYA DAVIDOVA
JAMES KIRWILL

382
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:44,515
A very good morning to you.

383
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:47,101
No, I've been up all night.

384
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:50,021
Come, come. No man
can work so many hours.

385
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:53,232
Don't worry, I'm going home to bed.
This is my breakfast.

386
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:58,820
The poet lays down his pen, the killer
his axe, and even you must learn to relax.

387
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,826
Well, bed. I can relax in bed.

388
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:09,456
I have just the thing to open up
your pores and unclog your weary mind.

389
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:15,003
This is my daily regime. A brisk walk,
a leisurely dip. It's wonderful.

390
00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:55,041
Even we humble servants of the state
need to be refreshed from time to time.

391
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:57,669
Ah!

392
00:45:57,794 --> 00:46:00,422
Well, well. This is a surprise.

393
00:46:00,505 --> 00:46:04,009
You recall Chief Investigator Renko
from last weekend?

394
00:46:04,092 --> 00:46:10,180
Yes. I'm not sure whether he arrested or
abducted the lady who accompanied me.

395
00:46:10,264 --> 00:46:11,724
Rescued.

396
00:46:11,807 --> 00:46:14,518
Say, from the machinations of a capitalist.

397
00:46:14,602 --> 00:46:18,105
Do sit down, Jack. Have a drink.
Have something to eat.

398
00:46:18,188 --> 00:46:24,361
Talk to the only one of our homicide team
with a 100% record of success.

399
00:46:25,696 --> 00:46:30,909
I'm afraid I have an appointment
with a general so old that he dribbles.

400
00:46:44,923 --> 00:46:49,636
I always wanted to meet an American.

401
00:46:50,136 --> 00:46:52,847
You are so... so different.

402
00:46:52,931 --> 00:46:55,307
Forgive me for staring.

403
00:46:55,432 --> 00:47:00,812
Only once before did I ever meet
an American in the flesh, so to speak.

404
00:47:00,896 --> 00:47:03,982
A young student.
Kirwill, I think he was called.

405
00:47:04,066 --> 00:47:06,193
James Kirwill.

406
00:47:06,276 --> 00:47:08,570
Oh?

407
00:47:08,695 --> 00:47:10,822
But he was dead.

408
00:47:10,948 --> 00:47:13,325
That doesn't count, then, does it?

409
00:47:15,285 --> 00:47:19,914
You must have noticed many differences
between a man like yourself, Mr Osborne,

410
00:47:19,997 --> 00:47:22,458
and a man like me.

411
00:47:22,541 --> 00:47:24,919
Man overboard.

412
00:47:26,921 --> 00:47:28,506
What?

413
00:47:28,589 --> 00:47:31,509
There's a sliver of food on your upper lip.

414
00:47:35,555 --> 00:47:38,891
I'm just a plodding investigator. No style.

415
00:47:39,934 --> 00:47:41,977
Completely out of my depth.

416
00:47:42,102 --> 00:47:48,817
Three bodies, three people,
shot down and mutilated in Gorky Park.

417
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,320
And me, I have food on my lip.

418
00:47:53,196 --> 00:47:55,907
Not even caviar at that.

419
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:01,371
I somehow feel that the executioner,
whoever he may be,

420
00:48:03,164 --> 00:48:05,917
would have preferred somebody...

421
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:10,963
a more, um... nimble opponent.

422
00:48:49,667 --> 00:48:53,588
- Ah. Finished eating, are we?
- Yes, thank you.

423
00:48:55,005 --> 00:48:58,926
I understand you import our
wonderful Soviet sable into America.

424
00:48:59,051 --> 00:49:01,887
You Soviets have
the world monopoly on sable.

425
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:04,514
I always wanted a sable hat.

426
00:49:06,892 --> 00:49:12,356
A man of your status should possess one.
Must we see what we can do?

427
00:49:12,439 --> 00:49:15,859
We Russians know how
to wait for things. I'm very patient.

428
00:49:15,943 --> 00:49:20,238
I watch and I think and I wait.
It is my only virtue.

429
00:49:20,696 --> 00:49:26,535
But why wait? I'm always happy to
accommodate particular Soviet friends.

430
00:49:26,994 --> 00:49:29,455
Patience has its own rewards.

431
00:49:30,206 --> 00:49:33,626
Do you want the hat or not?

432
00:49:34,752 --> 00:49:39,549
Perhaps the chief investigator
has some other reward in mind?

433
00:49:40,299 --> 00:49:42,677
Yes.

434
00:49:46,137 --> 00:49:48,181
Perhaps.

435
00:49:49,724 --> 00:49:52,435
- You don't know?
- Not yet.

436
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:57,232
First I have the hunch,
then I begin to assemble reasons.

437
00:49:57,315 --> 00:49:59,609
Then I...

438
00:49:59,693 --> 00:50:01,987
- And then you...?
- I pounce.

439
00:50:02,112 --> 00:50:06,741
That's no way to catch a sable.
They're far too cunning and far too fast.

440
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,829
While you wait and you think,
and you watch...

441
00:50:12,997 --> 00:50:15,291
your prey is gone.

442
00:50:15,374 --> 00:50:18,085
Oh, I don't think so.

443
00:50:18,168 --> 00:50:20,462
Good. Good.

444
00:50:21,589 --> 00:50:25,092
Meanwhile I have the hat and you don't.

445
00:50:52,285 --> 00:50:54,329
IRINA

446
00:50:54,454 --> 00:50:56,914
OSBORNE

447
00:51:38,579 --> 00:51:41,666
Bang!

448
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:48,463
- Detective Pavlovich, you're drunk!
- Not as drunk as Fet.

449
00:51:48,547 --> 00:51:51,383
Detective Fet!

450
00:51:51,466 --> 00:51:57,013
- I told you to follow him, not...
- Ah, ah, ah. Look what I've got.

451
00:51:57,097 --> 00:52:00,267
One of the KGB files.

452
00:52:00,392 --> 00:52:04,312
- How in God's name...?
- I stole it. From Fet.

453
00:52:04,437 --> 00:52:06,898
Fet! Little bastard.

454
00:52:07,857 --> 00:52:09,900
Pasha!

455
00:52:11,986 --> 00:52:15,155
Well, open it. No vomit on it, is there?

456
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:18,325
You mean you got Fet so drunk that...?

457
00:52:20,244 --> 00:52:23,831
- They'll shoot me, won't they?
- Probably.

458
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,794
I'll get shot.

459
00:52:32,506 --> 00:52:34,133
Fuck it.

460
00:52:34,258 --> 00:52:38,553
Pasha, this is Irina Asanova's file!

461
00:52:38,678 --> 00:52:41,139
Put the light out.

462
00:52:42,348 --> 00:52:46,269
"Expelled from Moscow University
for antisocial behaviour

463
00:52:46,394 --> 00:52:49,147
and unwise associations,

464
00:52:49,272 --> 00:52:52,358
particularly with Siberian renegade...

465
00:52:53,818 --> 00:52:56,279
Valerya Davidova."

466
00:53:01,617 --> 00:53:05,829
"KGB informant: Feodor Golodkin."

467
00:53:06,872 --> 00:53:09,166
"Used-car salesman."

468
00:53:40,821 --> 00:53:43,366
Where is Valerya?

469
00:53:44,534 --> 00:53:48,828
- What are you talking about?
- Where do you think she is?

470
00:53:48,954 --> 00:53:50,997
Who?

471
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:54,417
I've seen your file.

472
00:53:54,543 --> 00:53:59,422
You were friends with Valerya Davidova
and an American student, James Kirwill.

473
00:53:59,506 --> 00:54:04,928
The same file will tell you I was expelled
from university for writing on a wall.

474
00:54:06,221 --> 00:54:09,975
- Your friends are dead. Murdered.
- You're sick.

475
00:54:10,058 --> 00:54:13,310
I'll show you their bodies,
their clothes. Come and see.

476
00:54:13,394 --> 00:54:16,480
You're one of a leper organisation.
I won't be infected.

477
00:54:16,564 --> 00:54:20,317
- They were found in Gorky Park.
- Why do you lie? Do...

478
00:54:20,442 --> 00:54:24,029
- Where are they, these friends of yours?
- Out!

479
00:54:28,325 --> 00:54:30,286
Out?

480
00:54:30,369 --> 00:54:33,205
Who do you think got them out?

481
00:54:33,289 --> 00:54:37,041
You're trying to trap me.
I'm not going to betray my friends.

482
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:42,338
Whoever was to get them out led them to
their deaths. You must be in danger too.

483
00:54:42,422 --> 00:54:45,049
They're free.

484
00:54:45,133 --> 00:54:47,176
Free.

485
00:55:41,145 --> 00:55:44,899
Like a thigh, eh?
Just like strokin' her leg.

486
00:55:45,024 --> 00:55:47,318
Nice. Very nice.

487
00:55:50,779 --> 00:55:55,825
You're in love already.
Go on, take your time. Walk around it.

488
00:56:00,121 --> 00:56:03,792
If I wanted to walk,
I wouldn't be here, would I?

489
00:56:14,176 --> 00:56:18,472
- Anna said I was to talk to Golodkin.
- Who?

490
00:56:18,597 --> 00:56:23,310
Look, I've got these marks,
West German money. I was trying to...

491
00:56:23,394 --> 00:56:25,938
- That's all right. I can deal in that.
- No, no.

492
00:56:26,063 --> 00:56:30,192
Gotta be Golodkin.
"Make sure it's Golodkin" she said.

493
00:56:35,906 --> 00:56:41,744
It's all right, friend. Meet Feodor,
Feodor Golodkin. I'm your man.

494
00:56:41,828 --> 00:56:44,914
You never said a truer word.

495
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,044
Where the fuck
are you going?!

496
00:56:50,128 --> 00:56:54,048
- This is militia headquarters, dickhead!
- Just shut it.

497
00:56:54,132 --> 00:56:57,135
I work for the KGB.
I'm not talking to you.

498
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:59,304
All right?

499
00:57:01,014 --> 00:57:03,056
Now, listen...

500
00:57:06,435 --> 00:57:09,521
Pasha... open the window.

501
00:57:10,981 --> 00:57:13,275
My pleasure.

502
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,111
This is all some kind
of a misunderstanding.

503
00:57:16,195 --> 00:57:21,867
How did a greasy, parasitic pimp like you
come to meet a girl like Irina Asanova?

504
00:57:22,743 --> 00:57:24,244
Who?

505
00:57:24,328 --> 00:57:27,496
Pasha, handcuff this piece of shit.

506
00:57:27,622 --> 00:57:30,166
- Hey, now look. Hey, come on.
- My pleasure.

507
00:57:30,291 --> 00:57:34,837
Hey, now listen. Get off me.
Come on! I'm protected by KGB.

508
00:57:34,921 --> 00:57:38,007
- Ow! That hurts!
- Pasha, lift him up.

509
00:57:38,132 --> 00:57:40,426
- Get off me!
- Why are you trying to escape?

510
00:57:40,509 --> 00:57:42,803
I'm not! I'm not!

511
00:57:44,388 --> 00:57:45,848
What did he do, Pasha?

512
00:57:45,932 --> 00:57:50,228
Ran wildly to the open window,
Comrade Chief Investigator.

513
00:57:50,311 --> 00:57:55,023
- That's right.
- No, I didn't! I didn't! I didn't! I didn't!

514
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:59,569
No! No-o-o-o!

515
00:57:59,653 --> 00:58:03,698
We were counting.
When we reached three, away he went.

516
00:58:03,823 --> 00:58:06,993
- You're crazy. You wouldn't.
- One.

517
00:58:07,118 --> 00:58:08,995
- Two.
- No!

518
00:58:09,955 --> 00:58:12,415
- Three!
- No! Listen!

519
00:58:15,585 --> 00:58:22,091
That's him. He and Valerya and Irina and
this big fellow, Kostia, they were cronies.

520
00:58:22,216 --> 00:58:24,510
Kostia, did you say?

521
00:58:24,635 --> 00:58:29,598
- Who was he? What was he?
- He was a big ape from Siberia. Mukta.

522
00:58:29,682 --> 00:58:31,725
He was screwing Valerya.

523
00:58:31,851 --> 00:58:34,854
And they all knew Jack Osborne?

524
00:58:34,979 --> 00:58:37,648
Mr Jack Osborne? Yeah.

525
00:58:38,732 --> 00:58:41,901
- He wanted to bed down the girl. Valerya.
- And did he?

526
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:45,572
I should think so. Girls like
screwing foreigners, don't they?

527
00:58:45,697 --> 00:58:49,742
It's almost as good as travel.
Clean sheets, little presents.

528
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:56,207
And Kostia didn't seem to mind.
He was after something else.

529
00:58:56,291 --> 00:59:00,169
You see, Kostia knew that
Mr Jack Osborne wanted something.

530
00:59:00,295 --> 00:59:03,631
- That's...
- What did Osborne want?

531
00:59:03,756 --> 00:59:06,675
A chest. A big church chest.

532
00:59:06,758 --> 00:59:09,678
That's not a nun with tits.

533
00:59:12,723 --> 00:59:15,809
You know, with religious panels. Big...

534
00:59:15,934 --> 00:59:19,021
- What for?
- I don't know.

535
00:59:19,104 --> 00:59:23,108
But he promised me 2,000 American
dollars if I could get him one.

536
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:25,652
- And did you?
- Yes, I did.

537
00:59:25,736 --> 00:59:28,447
But Mr Jack Osborne
looked straight through me.

538
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:31,199
He got one from those three.
Cheaper, I'll bet.

539
00:59:31,324 --> 00:59:35,244
- Kirwill, Valerya and Kostia?
- Yeah. And I can't sell the one I got.

540
00:59:35,369 --> 00:59:41,125
It's too big for anybody to smuggle out.
You can't chop up a chest and hide it in...

541
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:43,878
Where is this chest?

542
00:59:43,961 --> 00:59:46,631
Where is it?

543
00:59:46,714 --> 00:59:48,758
My place.

544
00:59:48,883 --> 00:59:51,636
- Pasha, go with him. I want that chest.
- What, now?

545
00:59:51,761 --> 00:59:53,803
Yes, now.

546
01:00:10,862 --> 01:00:13,156
Goodbye, pretty lady.

547
01:00:27,044 --> 01:00:29,964
Well, I work hard. I work very hard.

548
01:00:31,507 --> 01:00:34,093
Holy Peter!

549
01:00:34,218 --> 01:00:37,304
Something you want?
Anything you'd like?

550
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:40,975
Where's this chest?

551
01:00:41,851 --> 01:00:47,188
How about, um,
100 good French condoms?

552
01:00:47,313 --> 01:00:49,691
- All colours.
- 100?

553
01:00:49,774 --> 01:00:53,278
Mm. It's just about enough
for a weekend, eh?

554
01:00:53,361 --> 01:00:56,698
- The chest.
- It's in the bathroom.

555
01:01:03,788 --> 01:01:06,249
There's no room for it in there.

556
01:01:06,331 --> 01:01:10,377
I don't want the damn thing
clutterin' up my nice room, anyway.

557
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:04,846
Comrade Prosecutor, Golodkin
was of some assistance to KGB.

558
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:07,766
- You know how it is.
- An informer, you mean.

559
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:12,812
- Well, it is our case.
- What do you mean "your case"?

560
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:17,609
- You festering baboon.
- And we have already determined

561
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:21,779
that Golodkin shot your man and
then turned his own gun upon himself.

562
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:25,658
- Very swift deduction. Congratulations.
- Your man was unarmed.

563
01:02:25,741 --> 01:02:30,120
It was that file, wasn't it?
It was a trap. A trap!

564
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:33,791
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- Listen!

565
01:02:33,874 --> 01:02:38,254
- You killed him! It was you!
- Arkady! Arkady!

566
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:40,422
Pull yourself together.

567
01:02:52,851 --> 01:02:56,354
There is an American
who is a link to everything.

568
01:02:56,479 --> 01:02:59,232
Oh? Who?

569
01:02:59,315 --> 01:03:02,485
An American who knew
all three of them.

570
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:05,697
An American who had
dealings with Golodkin.

571
01:03:06,865 --> 01:03:09,867
An American who has
very powerful friends.

572
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:12,619
- KGB friends.
- Who?

573
01:03:12,703 --> 01:03:15,622
An acquaintance of yours, I'm...

574
01:03:16,582 --> 01:03:18,292
Osborne.

575
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:21,044
Osborne? Jack Osborne?

576
01:03:22,671 --> 01:03:27,050
Why would an American businessman kill
three nobodies in the middle of Moscow?

577
01:03:27,134 --> 01:03:29,178
I don't know.

578
01:03:30,345 --> 01:03:32,139
- Unless...
- Unless what?

579
01:03:32,222 --> 01:03:35,474
Unless they were all involved
in something so big

580
01:03:35,558 --> 01:03:39,937
that Osborne had to make sure
his partners would never, ever talk.

581
01:03:41,189 --> 01:03:43,232
- Jack Osborne.
- Yes.

582
01:03:45,943 --> 01:03:49,030
Are you sure? Quite sure?

583
01:03:49,113 --> 01:03:51,699
In my bones.

584
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,577
Well, then...

585
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:56,704
go after him.

586
01:03:57,662 --> 01:04:00,582
He's at the Metropole Hotel.

587
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,377
Rattle him.

588
01:04:04,461 --> 01:04:07,214
Trip him up.

589
01:04:58,179 --> 01:05:01,349
Where is Valerya? You have to tell me.

590
01:05:01,975 --> 01:05:03,852
Safe.

591
01:05:03,977 --> 01:05:06,729
Please. I must know.

592
01:05:06,813 --> 01:05:09,023
At this precise moment?

593
01:05:09,107 --> 01:05:13,235
Certainly finishing her lunchtime
apיritif in Manhattan.

594
01:05:15,737 --> 01:05:18,407
Come to my room.

595
01:05:19,324 --> 01:05:20,868
Please.

596
01:08:10,822 --> 01:08:13,575
Let me go!

597
01:08:34,386 --> 01:08:36,430
Go away. I'm KGB.

598
01:09:14,591 --> 01:09:18,095
Why'd you come in
through the window, Boris?

599
01:09:18,178 --> 01:09:19,888
What?

600
01:09:20,013 --> 01:09:22,766
The door was open.

601
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:33,026
- Who is she?
- Irina Asanova.

602
01:09:33,152 --> 01:09:36,155
She knew your brother and the other two.

603
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:41,450
We've got to get her temperature down
quicker. Get some ice from my fridge.

604
01:09:41,576 --> 01:09:44,495
- Was she in on the killings?
- She thinks they got out.

605
01:09:44,579 --> 01:09:48,249
She can't believe they're dead.
But she's the key.

606
01:09:50,877 --> 01:09:55,590
Jesus Christ! What the hell kind
of a diet are you on, anyway, pal?

607
01:09:55,673 --> 01:09:57,717
Bring the ice.

608
01:10:04,347 --> 01:10:07,184
What the hell is that?

609
01:10:07,267 --> 01:10:11,396
I had it reconstructed from
one of the Gorky Park heads.

610
01:10:11,479 --> 01:10:13,106
Why?

611
01:10:14,024 --> 01:10:16,943
The killer had sliced off their faces.

612
01:10:18,695 --> 01:10:20,155
Shit.

613
01:10:20,238 --> 01:10:24,618
She'll be in a bad way when she comes
round, and if she sees that head...

614
01:10:24,743 --> 01:10:27,203
I'll take it.

615
01:10:31,624 --> 01:10:35,920
She's going to be all right.
He didn't get enough into her veins.

616
01:10:36,045 --> 01:10:39,048
Renko, give me somethin'.

617
01:10:39,131 --> 01:10:42,051
Give me somethin' to work on.

618
01:10:44,011 --> 01:10:46,055
Come on.

619
01:10:48,265 --> 01:10:51,601
I believe the three were making a chest.

620
01:10:51,684 --> 01:10:55,522
A religious chest for
the black market in icons.

621
01:10:55,605 --> 01:10:58,691
- Yeah. And?
- Their clothing.

622
01:10:59,150 --> 01:11:02,070
Beside the traces of gold and gesso...

623
01:11:04,364 --> 01:11:09,327
there were spots of chicken
and fish blood. I don't know why.

624
01:11:10,286 --> 01:11:14,999
I've been in Soviet markets. I've never
seen anything fresh enough to bleed.

625
01:11:15,083 --> 01:11:18,919
- I'll be seeing you.
- I'm very grateful to you.

626
01:11:21,463 --> 01:11:25,676
Well, when you took that shot
at me you aimed away.

627
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,887
Not by much.

628
01:11:29,012 --> 01:11:31,932
By enough. Maybe you're for real.

629
01:11:34,893 --> 01:11:38,147
Maybe you just don't shoot very well.

630
01:11:38,939 --> 01:11:42,108
You'll never know, will you?

631
01:12:29,778 --> 01:12:32,781
Why did you save my life?

632
01:12:32,907 --> 01:12:35,826
You're important to my investigation.

633
01:12:36,619 --> 01:12:40,456
- Now what?
- Well, when your clothes are dry, you go.

634
01:12:41,499 --> 01:12:43,042
Where?

635
01:12:43,167 --> 01:12:45,878
It's up to you.

636
01:12:46,587 --> 01:12:48,214
Home.

637
01:12:48,297 --> 01:12:51,217
They'll be waiting for me.

638
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,930
Friends, then. You must have
someone you can stay with.

639
01:12:57,013 --> 01:12:59,933
And get them into trouble as well?

640
01:13:03,186 --> 01:13:05,897
- Citizen Asanova...
- Irina.

641
01:13:08,107 --> 01:13:10,777
You've undressed me.

642
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:14,030
Irina.

643
01:13:14,155 --> 01:13:17,659
- This is the worst place for you to be.
- It's very simple.

644
01:13:17,741 --> 01:13:22,037
Either you are with them, and it doesn't
matter where I run, or you are not and...

645
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:26,041
- You'll be trapped here. They saw me.
- We'd be trapped here.

646
01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:28,627
I can't take care of you.

647
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:31,713
You've got two plates, two cups.

648
01:13:32,464 --> 01:13:34,925
Why did you go to the hotel?

649
01:13:35,884 --> 01:13:39,930
- What is Osborne to you?
- A friend.

650
01:13:40,055 --> 01:13:43,474
A friend? What sort of friend?

651
01:13:43,558 --> 01:13:46,477
Is he the one you think
got them out? Is that it?

652
01:13:46,602 --> 01:13:48,396
No questions.

653
01:13:51,274 --> 01:13:53,317
Irina.

654
01:13:53,442 --> 01:13:56,445
My friend is dead. Your friends are dead.

655
01:13:56,571 --> 01:14:00,324
- Why delude yourself? Why?
- Then why did KGB try to take me?

656
01:14:00,449 --> 01:14:03,786
Perhaps to protect the killer.
To protect Osborne.

657
01:14:03,911 --> 01:14:06,372
All I know is your friends were killed.

658
01:14:06,496 --> 01:14:08,790
- No!
- Irina, please.

659
01:14:08,915 --> 01:14:12,669
If I had a gun and I could
get out, I'd shoot you now.

660
01:14:15,505 --> 01:14:18,341
Here, take it.

661
01:14:18,425 --> 01:14:20,468
Take it.

662
01:14:22,596 --> 01:14:25,056
What are you waiting for?

663
01:14:33,314 --> 01:14:36,567
That's not going to get me out, is it?

664
01:15:58,062 --> 01:16:00,731
How are they killed?

665
01:16:00,815 --> 01:16:03,359
- Uh, who?
- Sables.

666
01:16:04,443 --> 01:16:07,697
- You don't think I kill them myself?
- Yes, I do.

667
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:10,615
Oh, no, no, no. I do not soil my hands.

668
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:14,995
I mean, do you kill the animal when you
eat his flesh or use his skin for boots?

669
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,664
No. Like most of us I turn
my eyes from such things.

670
01:16:17,789 --> 01:16:21,042
- Exactly.
- I said like most of us.

671
01:16:21,168 --> 01:16:25,630
Yes, I suppose there are those
who enjoy the act of butchery.

672
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:31,136
Especially if they feel
themselves superior beings.

673
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,472
- Yes?
- What are we talking about?

674
01:16:34,597 --> 01:16:37,516
- Dead bodies in Gorky Park.
- Ah.

675
01:16:38,476 --> 01:16:41,812
- Doesn't it interest you?
- Me?

676
01:16:41,896 --> 01:16:44,899
I have established that
you knew all three of them.

677
01:16:45,024 --> 01:16:46,901
Have you, now?

678
01:16:47,026 --> 01:16:48,486
Well.

679
01:16:50,404 --> 01:16:53,574
I met Stalin when I was young.
Did you know that?

680
01:16:55,034 --> 01:16:56,577
No.

681
01:16:56,702 --> 01:16:59,245
Well, you do know that Stalin is dead.

682
01:17:00,371 --> 01:17:04,834
Now, does the mere fact that I met him
prove that I killed him?

683
01:17:06,252 --> 01:17:10,465
- The sadist cut off their faces.
- Do you mind?

684
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:13,510
In the same way he might skin an animal.

685
01:17:14,677 --> 01:17:17,138
A sable, perhaps.

686
01:17:17,263 --> 01:17:19,891
I don't think we'll be seeing
each other again.

687
01:17:19,974 --> 01:17:21,434
Oh?

688
01:17:23,227 --> 01:17:26,814
You once said that patience
was your only virtue.

689
01:17:28,273 --> 01:17:31,026
That you watch and you wait.

690
01:17:31,109 --> 01:17:36,073
I have only four days more in Moscow.
After that I'm leaving for good.

691
01:17:36,198 --> 01:17:39,451
However, I feel that you
deserve some reward.

692
01:17:41,537 --> 01:17:44,248
Expect a knock at your door.

693
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:48,876
I'm having that sable hat delivered to you.

694
01:18:03,766 --> 01:18:07,520
- It was good. Thank you.
- Anybody can cook stew.

695
01:18:08,855 --> 01:18:11,773
You could burn it. I do.

696
01:18:14,067 --> 01:18:16,278
Irina?

697
01:18:16,403 --> 01:18:18,446
Help me, please.

698
01:18:26,496 --> 01:18:29,916
How do I know the attack on me
wasn't staged to make me trust you?

699
01:18:30,041 --> 01:18:31,668
Irina.

700
01:18:38,924 --> 01:18:42,678
How do I know that you didn't plan it
to make me betray my friends?

701
01:18:42,803 --> 01:18:45,014
Like Osborne, you mean.

702
01:18:45,764 --> 01:18:47,808
Your friend Osborne.

703
01:18:50,394 --> 01:18:54,607
Let's talk about Osborne.
Tell me about Osborne.

704
01:18:54,732 --> 01:18:57,651
Is that all you can do? Talk?

705
01:18:58,402 --> 01:19:00,111
Talk?

706
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:02,780
Irina, listen.

707
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:08,369
You don't have to talk so much.

708
01:19:09,329 --> 01:19:12,248
Irina, I am your friend.

709
01:19:18,213 --> 01:19:20,590
No. My enemy.

710
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:31,767
Everything I've told you... is either
an extraordinarily elaborate lie...

711
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:35,646
or the very simple truth.

712
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:42,986
It's a lie.

713
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:08,010
No! No!

714
01:20:11,806 --> 01:20:14,641
They're not dead. They're not dead.

715
01:20:14,766 --> 01:20:17,686
Don't hold back. Let it out. Let it come.

716
01:20:24,818 --> 01:20:26,611
I'm...

717
01:20:26,695 --> 01:20:29,322
Arkady, I'm going out of my mind.

718
01:20:29,406 --> 01:20:31,950
I don't know what's going on or who to...

719
01:20:32,909 --> 01:20:35,912
Irina, listen to me. I won't tell you lies.

720
01:20:37,621 --> 01:20:40,624
- No, you're tormenting me.
- No. No, Irina.

721
01:20:52,553 --> 01:20:57,892
It doesn't matter how ridiculous a lie is
if it's your only chance of escape.

722
01:20:57,975 --> 01:20:59,852
No. Irina, no.

723
01:20:59,977 --> 01:21:05,398
It doesn't matter how obvious the truth is
if the truth is that you'll never escape.

724
01:21:05,523 --> 01:21:07,150
Irina.

725
01:22:54,128 --> 01:22:57,381
So this Irina was
a friend of my brother.

726
01:22:57,465 --> 01:23:00,384
At the university before he was deported.

727
01:23:00,468 --> 01:23:03,720
Why did he come back?

728
01:23:03,845 --> 01:23:08,558
Jimmy wanted to be a fuckin' hero.
You gotta turn right, right here.

729
01:23:08,641 --> 01:23:12,937
He was determined to smuggle somebody
out of the Soviet Union.

730
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:15,940
Anybody, even if they didn't wanna go.

731
01:23:17,066 --> 01:23:19,360
How come you know so much about us?

732
01:23:19,444 --> 01:23:22,614
My grandmother. She was one
of you. She was a Russian.

733
01:23:22,739 --> 01:23:25,909
I spoke Russian before I spoke English.

734
01:23:26,034 --> 01:23:29,453
Jimmy was... He was always
obsessed with this country.

735
01:23:29,578 --> 01:23:32,039
It's all he ever talked about.

736
01:23:32,122 --> 01:23:35,626
All right. You gotta turn left
in here and then park.

737
01:23:36,919 --> 01:23:40,088
- Heard of born-again Christians?
- No.

738
01:23:40,214 --> 01:23:45,177
Born-again Christians. They don't smoke,
they don't swear, they don't fuck.

739
01:23:45,302 --> 01:23:50,098
All they do is talk about Jesus
and try to walk on the goddamn water.

740
01:23:51,391 --> 01:23:54,560
That was Jimmy, God love him.

741
01:23:58,648 --> 01:24:02,693
- That's it over there.
- How'd you find this place?

742
01:24:04,487 --> 01:24:07,657
I got a nose for fresh fish
and chicken blood.

743
01:24:09,450 --> 01:24:11,410
What a stench.

744
01:24:11,536 --> 01:24:15,123
This is where they made the chest.
That's how they got 'em out.

745
01:24:15,206 --> 01:24:18,959
- Live sables.
- Bingo. They fed 'em the fresh meat.

746
01:24:20,001 --> 01:24:22,129
Six live sables.

747
01:24:22,212 --> 01:24:24,965
I'm no expert on sable shit
but, yeah, I think so.

748
01:24:25,048 --> 01:24:27,717
They'd be worth how much
to an American?

749
01:24:27,843 --> 01:24:32,305
Freedom. Smash the monopoly. How
high can you count? Worth killing for.

750
01:24:32,389 --> 01:24:34,975
Motive.

751
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:37,477
Evidence.

752
01:24:37,602 --> 01:24:39,646
Circumstantial.

753
01:24:41,605 --> 01:24:44,316
Witness.

754
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,236
In your apartment, Arkady.

755
01:24:47,319 --> 01:24:51,449
She's got to tell me, now.
Osborne is leaving in three days.

756
01:24:55,161 --> 01:24:57,455
Don't kill him.

757
01:24:58,414 --> 01:25:00,458
Not yet.

758
01:25:10,091 --> 01:25:13,011
What is it, Arkasha?

759
01:25:13,094 --> 01:25:16,598
I have no sugar for your tea.

760
01:25:16,681 --> 01:25:19,350
I don't need it.

761
01:25:22,353 --> 01:25:25,690
Do you still think I'm lying to you?

762
01:25:25,774 --> 01:25:30,486
- That I am just a militia investigator?
- Arkasha...

763
01:25:30,611 --> 01:25:34,907
Do you imagine I'm trying to trap you,
that this is all just a terrible game?

764
01:25:34,990 --> 01:25:36,867
No.

765
01:25:39,578 --> 01:25:41,872
But...

766
01:25:41,955 --> 01:25:43,999
But what?

767
01:25:46,376 --> 01:25:49,963
- If Valerya is safe somewhere...
- Irina, I love you.

768
01:25:50,088 --> 01:25:52,382
I... Arkasha...

769
01:25:52,508 --> 01:25:55,134
Help me.

770
01:25:57,011 --> 01:26:00,014
I've learned to trust nothing.

771
01:26:00,097 --> 01:26:02,141
Nobody.

772
01:26:03,226 --> 01:26:04,685
Never.

773
01:26:04,769 --> 01:26:06,395
Irina.

774
01:26:07,438 --> 01:26:10,441
If Valerya is safe somewhere, I...

775
01:26:12,110 --> 01:26:16,030
And if she is dead, she is dead.
How can I help her?

776
01:26:28,041 --> 01:26:30,585
- Let's go.
- Arkady.

777
01:26:31,837 --> 01:26:34,297
You talk too easily about dying.

778
01:26:46,725 --> 01:26:49,728
Where are we going, Arkasha?

779
01:26:49,854 --> 01:26:51,981
You'll see.

780
01:27:27,098 --> 01:27:30,268
You know who was here, don't you?

781
01:27:30,351 --> 01:27:32,394
Come on!

782
01:27:32,519 --> 01:27:33,979
No.

783
01:27:35,439 --> 01:27:38,358
Then what else can I do?

784
01:27:51,622 --> 01:27:53,665
Little Jimmy.

785
01:27:57,668 --> 01:28:00,338
Kostia, the big man.

786
01:28:03,090 --> 01:28:06,344
Valerya, you. Let us reconstruct.

787
01:28:06,469 --> 01:28:09,639
- Please. Arkady, don't.
- There's three of you.

788
01:28:09,764 --> 01:28:14,477
You believe a whole new life
is about to begin. Yes. Glide.

789
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:17,480
Glide. Valerya and Kostia and Jimmy.

790
01:28:18,856 --> 01:28:21,608
Let your skates bite and hiss.

791
01:28:21,733 --> 01:28:27,489
Your very movement reminds you of the
freedom that will soon be yours. Glide.

792
01:28:28,281 --> 01:28:30,951
Glide, my little ones.

793
01:28:31,076 --> 01:28:33,120
Ah, Valerya.

794
01:28:33,995 --> 01:28:38,208
The little bird. She's wearing her
friend's skates. Her good friend.

795
01:28:38,333 --> 01:28:41,670
But there's someone else watching.

796
01:28:42,587 --> 01:28:47,299
Isn't there? Someone who
beckons them from the ice.

797
01:28:47,424 --> 01:28:51,637
Oh, happy Valerya. Trusting
Valerya. Innocent Valerya.

798
01:28:51,762 --> 01:28:54,849
I'm their saviour from the West.
It's laughter and toasts.

799
01:28:54,932 --> 01:28:57,143
Hear the music?

800
01:28:57,226 --> 01:29:02,273
Ah, we need another bottle.
Why not? I sort through the bag.

801
01:29:02,398 --> 01:29:05,651
I feel the grip of the gun.

802
01:29:08,446 --> 01:29:11,614
I turn to Kostia and I smile.

803
01:29:12,949 --> 01:29:14,242
And...

804
01:29:19,205 --> 01:29:22,208
Jimmy doesn't know what's
happening. How can this be?

805
01:29:22,292 --> 01:29:26,671
Osborne had used him to gull the others.
He had been brought back into Russia

806
01:29:26,796 --> 01:29:31,009
as proof that Osborne could get
people in and out. Isn't that so?

807
01:29:32,469 --> 01:29:35,888
Poor Jimmy. Idealistic Jimmy
who only wanted to help.

808
01:29:35,971 --> 01:29:39,641
The Christian who now
must turn the other cheek.

809
01:29:48,525 --> 01:29:51,695
- What about Valerya?
- No, Arkady.

810
01:29:51,779 --> 01:29:54,782
- No.
- My love, why don't you stop me?

811
01:29:54,907 --> 01:29:58,242
Do I have to be the killer?
I have to have a witness.

812
01:29:58,367 --> 01:30:01,871
Someone must tell me.

813
01:30:04,749 --> 01:30:07,668
You must tell me.

814
01:30:07,794 --> 01:30:09,921
I can't.

815
01:30:13,591 --> 01:30:16,594
She doesn't scream. Doesn't run.

816
01:30:16,677 --> 01:30:18,721
What's the point?

817
01:30:18,846 --> 01:30:22,265
Her life, her hopes... done.

818
01:30:23,558 --> 01:30:28,188
This man has made love to her. He can
bring the gun as close as he wants.

819
01:30:28,271 --> 01:30:32,317
He can almost caress her with it
and she'll welcome the bullet.

820
01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:40,867
No.

821
01:30:40,992 --> 01:30:42,536
Yes.

822
01:30:56,757 --> 01:30:58,801
But what of Valerya's friend?

823
01:30:58,926 --> 01:31:04,181
What about you? She won't tell because
she wants Valerya to be in America, free.

824
01:31:04,306 --> 01:31:10,728
She won't tell because Osborne has
told her she is to be the next to get out,

825
01:31:10,812 --> 01:31:16,192
and this fantasy is the most
important thing in her life.

826
01:31:16,276 --> 01:31:18,862
It's all that keeps her going.

827
01:31:18,987 --> 01:31:20,864
Yes.

828
01:31:27,537 --> 01:31:30,457
So, the question is, where is Valerya?

829
01:31:32,625 --> 01:31:34,669
New York.

830
01:31:35,669 --> 01:31:38,380
She's in New York.

831
01:31:48,265 --> 01:31:50,726
But in Moscow...

832
01:31:54,855 --> 01:31:57,775
the great Professor Andreev...

833
01:31:58,692 --> 01:32:01,235
can reconstruct a head.

834
01:32:02,528 --> 01:32:04,572
A face.

835
01:32:05,490 --> 01:32:07,700
From the bones and tissue alone.

836
01:32:07,784 --> 01:32:10,536
No. Hope is all I know.

837
01:32:10,661 --> 01:32:12,705
Here is Valerya.

838
01:32:13,498 --> 01:32:16,250
V- Valerya. Valerya. Valerya!

839
01:32:22,215 --> 01:32:24,508
- Valerya who?
- Valerya Davidova.

840
01:32:24,633 --> 01:32:27,010
- The others?
- Kostia Borodin. James Kirwill.

841
01:32:27,094 --> 01:32:30,180
- What were they doing here?
- Making a chest for Osborne.

842
01:32:30,305 --> 01:32:32,432
American furrier, Jack Osborne?

843
01:32:32,557 --> 01:32:34,601
Yes, Jack Osborne.

844
01:32:35,435 --> 01:32:39,272
You saw what they brought
Osborne here from Siberia.

845
01:32:39,397 --> 01:32:41,858
Tell me. Say it.

846
01:32:41,942 --> 01:32:43,401
Sables.

847
01:32:43,527 --> 01:32:46,446
Live, dead, pelts, what?

848
01:32:46,530 --> 01:32:49,532
- Live sables.
- How many?

849
01:32:49,657 --> 01:32:52,493
Six sables.

850
01:32:52,576 --> 01:32:55,037
Six live sables.

851
01:32:55,121 --> 01:32:57,164
Good girl.

852
01:32:58,040 --> 01:33:00,084
I hate you.

853
01:33:05,297 --> 01:33:09,135
Irina, lies are not freedom.

854
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:11,554
I hate you!

855
01:33:47,212 --> 01:33:49,256
Where'd she go?

856
01:33:52,009 --> 01:33:55,429
Think she's taken off with Osborne, huh?

857
01:33:59,099 --> 01:34:01,934
OK. Well, tell me where
we're going, will you?

858
01:34:02,018 --> 01:34:05,605
I need the other head.
Then I'll have enough.

859
01:34:06,272 --> 01:34:08,316
The other head?

860
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:31,338
- KGB?
- Yes.

861
01:34:31,463 --> 01:34:35,383
But why would they steal the evidence?
It must be something else.

862
01:34:35,467 --> 01:34:38,637
- What else?
- Well...

863
01:34:39,805 --> 01:34:42,474
We'll see, won't we?

864
01:35:42,197 --> 01:35:45,117
What the hell are you doin'?

865
01:35:46,535 --> 01:35:49,121
You know where we are.

866
01:35:49,246 --> 01:35:51,915
Now I do.

867
01:36:02,509 --> 01:36:04,552
I'm a fool.

868
01:36:05,386 --> 01:36:08,806
- What does that mean?
- That I've missed everything.

869
01:36:09,390 --> 01:36:12,560
That's lamskoy, the chief
prosecutor of Moscow.

870
01:36:13,561 --> 01:36:17,064
And Jack Osborne. They've
been dealing the whole time.

871
01:36:18,274 --> 01:36:23,321
So now they'll deal with me.
I've no chance now, nowhere to go.

872
01:36:23,404 --> 01:36:25,281
They've beaten me.

873
01:36:27,532 --> 01:36:29,910
Oh, God.

874
01:36:29,993 --> 01:36:32,204
Don't look.

875
01:37:21,251 --> 01:37:25,463
- You'll be even richer.
- You won't be exactly poor.

876
01:37:25,547 --> 01:37:29,467
What can I spend it on here?
I wish I could come to Stockholm.

877
01:37:29,592 --> 01:37:33,179
Diamonds look their best
on a young girl's throat.

878
01:37:33,263 --> 01:37:36,433
You must never
again be seen with me.

879
01:37:36,516 --> 01:37:39,436
But I'll send you a postcard
from Stockholm.

880
01:37:39,561 --> 01:37:41,603
Good luck, then.

881
01:38:07,128 --> 01:38:09,172
- Bastard.
- Don't.

882
01:38:10,298 --> 01:38:14,427
You're making a mistake. We're
on the same side. I promise you.

883
01:38:17,054 --> 01:38:19,766
We wanna talk to him.

884
01:38:27,774 --> 01:38:29,816
You're a fool!

885
01:38:29,941 --> 01:38:34,071
We don't need to talk to him.
Osborne's going to Stockholm.

886
01:38:36,073 --> 01:38:38,450
Stockholm!

887
01:38:38,575 --> 01:38:41,244
Come on! Get me out of this place.

888
01:38:41,328 --> 01:38:44,498
Come on! I wanna stay one step
ahead of that bastard.

889
01:38:44,581 --> 01:38:49,044
You on the outside and me on the inside,
looking at you from the morgue!

890
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:30,583
I want you to promise me,
Anton, on your life...

891
01:39:32,001 --> 01:39:38,091
that you will take all this - papers, tape -
personally to the prosecutor general.

892
01:39:38,174 --> 01:39:41,177
On my life, I promise.

893
01:39:43,387 --> 01:39:47,433
- And give me your gun.
- Oh, Christ.

894
01:40:02,656 --> 01:40:05,367
It's a lawyer's special issue.

895
01:40:05,451 --> 01:40:08,369
It probably won't shoot straight.

896
01:40:14,375 --> 01:40:20,548
And if Irina ever turns up...
take care of her for me.

897
01:40:20,631 --> 01:40:24,218
Well, sure. I'll give her your beautiful car.

898
01:40:37,606 --> 01:40:40,942
- What are you going to do?
- A brisk walk.

899
01:40:44,279 --> 01:40:46,740
And a little dip.

900
01:41:11,388 --> 01:41:13,099
Arkady.

901
01:41:13,474 --> 01:41:18,687
The firing squad will not be quite
as much fun as Stockholm, will it?

902
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:29,864
Arkady.

903
01:41:31,741 --> 01:41:34,661
You're out of... you're out of control.

904
01:41:37,997 --> 01:41:40,708
You kept me on the case
to put pressure on Osborne.

905
01:41:40,792 --> 01:41:43,962
He couldn't have been offering... enough.

906
01:41:44,087 --> 01:41:46,463
But you settled.

907
01:41:46,588 --> 01:41:49,133
The price must have been high.

908
01:41:49,216 --> 01:41:54,179
You should be looked after.
Certainly you should be looked after.

909
01:41:54,847 --> 01:41:57,474
How much?

910
01:41:59,476 --> 01:42:01,979
$100,000, American?

911
01:42:02,104 --> 01:42:06,233
Come on. You know
the value of live sables.

912
01:42:06,358 --> 01:42:09,694
This'll be worth tens
of millions to Osborne.

913
01:42:10,486 --> 01:42:12,780
Osborne was greedy.

914
01:42:12,905 --> 01:42:15,908
That's why I had to
threaten him with, uh...

915
01:42:15,992 --> 01:42:19,328
I was going to say my best man.

916
01:42:21,497 --> 01:42:24,167
150,000, hm? How about that?

917
01:44:04,179 --> 01:44:06,557
- I've ordered stingers.
- Stingers.

918
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:09,268
- What's that?
- Cognac and crטme de menthe.

919
01:44:09,351 --> 01:44:12,854
Which of the two is meant
to spoil the other?

920
01:44:12,979 --> 01:44:16,315
In Sweden all
excesses are permitted.

921
01:44:19,861 --> 01:44:24,490
Comrade Pribluda, when do I get
the gun, and where do I kill him?

922
01:44:26,325 --> 01:44:29,245
You will ask no questions.
You will make no comments.

923
01:44:29,328 --> 01:44:32,165
You will simply do as you're told.

924
01:44:32,290 --> 01:44:35,208
Consider yourself lucky to be still alive.

925
01:44:35,333 --> 01:44:41,590
Osborne will trade. He'll return the
six sables, but he'll only talk to you.

926
01:44:41,673 --> 01:44:44,760
And I don't like that, Renko.

927
01:44:44,843 --> 01:44:48,180
I'm warning you. Be very, very careful.

928
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:51,391
Why will he trade?

929
01:44:52,809 --> 01:44:54,936
What will he trade?

930
01:44:57,272 --> 01:45:01,025
Which is the brandy?
Which is the crטme de menthe?

931
01:45:02,276 --> 01:45:05,196
Let's see if you can tell, Renko.

932
01:45:11,577 --> 01:45:13,287
Bruised, are we?

933
01:45:13,370 --> 01:45:18,084
I imagine they wanted to make quite sure
you were telling the truth about lamskoy.

934
01:45:18,209 --> 01:45:21,712
Well, he didn't know
how good you were, did he?

935
01:45:22,671 --> 01:45:24,881
The fool.

936
01:45:25,006 --> 01:45:27,926
And now you're here to kill me.

937
01:45:28,802 --> 01:45:31,262
Right?

938
01:45:31,346 --> 01:45:33,223
Yes.

939
01:46:13,428 --> 01:46:14,971
What do you think?

940
01:46:15,054 --> 01:46:19,100
You know the KGB will always
track you down, wherever you are.

941
01:46:19,183 --> 01:46:20,893
Precisely.

942
01:46:20,977 --> 01:46:23,896
So, what exactly are you proposing?

943
01:46:28,234 --> 01:46:31,821
- Do not be unduly alarmed.
- What are you doing?

944
01:46:31,946 --> 01:46:35,032
You haven't seen
the rest of the house yet.

945
01:46:43,665 --> 01:46:47,502
Old houses are so like people,
don't you think?

946
01:46:47,586 --> 01:46:50,047
Full of surprises.

947
01:46:52,507 --> 01:46:54,801
- Open that door.
- What?

948
01:46:54,885 --> 01:46:56,928
Open the door.

949
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:15,863
I made them bring you.

950
01:47:15,988 --> 01:47:18,991
You see, corruption is part of us.

951
01:47:19,116 --> 01:47:21,410
All of us.

952
01:47:21,494 --> 01:47:24,413
The very heart of us.

953
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:29,000
Irina?

954
01:47:42,514 --> 01:47:46,434
Why should a woman sleep with a killer
unless she likes being hurt?

955
01:47:46,559 --> 01:47:48,186
- No!
- No?

956
01:47:48,269 --> 01:47:52,189
Then it's money that excites you,
perhaps? It's money?

957
01:47:52,314 --> 01:47:57,569
You've earned it, Irina. You paid with
the lives of your friends. What is this?

958
01:47:57,694 --> 01:48:00,614
Is this another one of his gifts?

959
01:48:01,448 --> 01:48:04,159
You're a whore, Irina.

960
01:48:05,369 --> 01:48:07,413
You're a whore.

961
01:48:09,748 --> 01:48:15,920
When you showed me the head -
Valerya's head - I decided to kill myself.

962
01:48:16,045 --> 01:48:18,089
- Melodrama.
- Yes.

963
01:48:19,799 --> 01:48:23,219
I went to Osborne instead.
I slept with him.

964
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:33,813
I didn't feel dirty. I felt as though
a layer of my skin had been burnt away.

965
01:48:34,731 --> 01:48:39,109
- I knew what to do.
- Yes. Sell yourself.

966
01:48:40,402 --> 01:48:43,321
What else did I have to sell?

967
01:48:53,248 --> 01:48:56,251
I told him I knew everything.

968
01:48:56,334 --> 01:49:00,213
But I knew he wanted me. I told
you I'd do anything to get out.

969
01:49:00,338 --> 01:49:01,965
Anything.

970
01:49:02,090 --> 01:49:06,552
The second day in Stockholm I went
to the KGB. The Russian embassy.

971
01:49:06,677 --> 01:49:10,806
I told them I could get the sables back
if they would trade you for them,

972
01:49:10,931 --> 01:49:14,268
if they would let you out because...

973
01:49:14,351 --> 01:49:16,395
because I...

974
01:49:20,566 --> 01:49:22,693
Irina?

975
01:49:26,447 --> 01:49:28,907
I had to get you out.

976
01:49:29,032 --> 01:49:31,576
It was the only reason.

977
01:49:33,161 --> 01:49:36,664
Why would Osborne trade
the sables for me?

978
01:49:42,045 --> 01:49:45,382
He's got more than six, Arkasha.

979
01:49:45,507 --> 01:49:49,010
Valerya and the others helped him
use the route once before.

980
01:49:49,135 --> 01:49:51,596
He's got another six sables.

981
01:49:51,721 --> 01:49:55,474
And nobody knows it, except him and me.

982
01:49:58,060 --> 01:50:00,270
And now you.

983
01:50:31,217 --> 01:50:36,973
Frankly, I am astounded that your people
would understand a sexual obsession.

984
01:50:38,224 --> 01:50:43,270
But, well, it seems they understand that
I want her enough to trade the sables.

985
01:50:44,229 --> 01:50:46,982
Only she won't come without you.

986
01:50:47,107 --> 01:50:49,151
But they sent me here to kill you.

987
01:50:49,276 --> 01:50:52,446
But they'd rather have
their little furry friends back.

988
01:50:52,571 --> 01:50:55,824
- But my job is to kill you.
- What?

989
01:50:55,907 --> 01:50:58,827
Kill a man who keeps his promises?

990
01:51:01,621 --> 01:51:05,750
You see the hat that was not
delivered to you in Moscow.

991
01:51:05,875 --> 01:51:08,419
Barguzinsky sable. The finest.

992
01:51:08,502 --> 01:51:12,006
There's no more comparison
between this and ordinary fur

993
01:51:12,131 --> 01:51:15,634
than Irina's skin and that of other women.

994
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:18,846
Feel it.

995
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:24,894
You're sick, Osborne. Sick. I don't want
the hat or anything else from you.

996
01:51:25,019 --> 01:51:29,148
Oh, be forgiving. You want
to survive, don't you?

997
01:51:30,356 --> 01:51:34,486
Tomorrow, if you convince them,
the Soviets and I will trade.

998
01:51:34,611 --> 01:51:37,530
You and Irina for the six sables.

999
01:51:38,448 --> 01:51:40,742
Oh, and, uh, $200,000.

1000
01:51:42,118 --> 01:51:44,162
Do you agree?

1001
01:51:45,246 --> 01:51:46,790
Yes.

1002
01:51:58,717 --> 01:52:01,553
A stinger, please. A stinger.

1003
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:08,936
- That's a whore's drink.
- I am a whore.

1004
01:52:09,019 --> 01:52:11,230
- How many?
- Three upstairs. KGB.

1005
01:52:11,355 --> 01:52:14,858
- Maybe more down here.
- OK. What's the score?

1006
01:52:14,942 --> 01:52:17,778
- I'll give you one, two, three.
- OK. Shoot.

1007
01:52:17,903 --> 01:52:19,529
One.

1008
01:52:19,654 --> 01:52:24,784
Osborne is deceiving KGB into a swap.
Six sables for Irina and me, plus dollars.

1009
01:52:25,785 --> 01:52:30,498
- But he's got more out than they know.
- When's the swap?

1010
01:52:30,623 --> 01:52:33,960
- Tomorrow. They've bought it.
- OK. Two.

1011
01:52:34,711 --> 01:52:39,424
Two. I am under orders from Moscow
to kill Osborne and the sables.

1012
01:52:40,508 --> 01:52:43,510
- Three.
- Three. The KGB kills Osborne,

1013
01:52:43,635 --> 01:52:47,139
you, the girl and the sables.
Am I right?

1014
01:52:47,973 --> 01:52:50,892
- Correct.
- Does she know this?

1015
01:52:51,768 --> 01:52:53,395
No.

1016
01:52:56,523 --> 01:53:01,862
- You're in a hell of a jam. Did I tell you?
- Yes, thank you. Eat some of my peanuts.

1017
01:53:01,945 --> 01:53:04,614
I'll be there. Good luck.

1018
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:08,075
- What are you doing?
- This is a whore's drink.

1019
01:53:08,159 --> 01:53:12,788
- Give me that. Let's get out of here.
- We've got an early start.

1020
01:53:23,758 --> 01:53:26,677
Son of a bitch.

1021
01:54:22,897 --> 01:54:25,566
Oh, no.

1022
01:54:29,696 --> 01:54:32,240
- Don't touch him.
- Oh...

1023
01:54:33,282 --> 01:54:35,159
God, no.

1024
01:54:35,243 --> 01:54:38,413
What are you up to, Renko?
What's he doing here?

1025
01:54:38,496 --> 01:54:41,749
- What the hell is going on?
- Who is it? Who?

1026
01:54:43,876 --> 01:54:45,919
A friend.

1027
01:54:48,213 --> 01:54:50,257
He killed my dogs.

1028
01:54:52,134 --> 01:54:56,263
I gutted him because he killed my dogs.

1029
01:54:57,347 --> 01:54:59,891
Now, Mr Osborne.

1030
01:55:00,016 --> 01:55:03,520
Let's not concern ourselves
with the intruder.

1031
01:55:03,645 --> 01:55:06,481
Are these the six sables?

1032
01:55:06,606 --> 01:55:10,735
The sables are dead.
Throw down your guns.

1033
01:55:11,527 --> 01:55:14,238
Not while you have yours.

1034
01:55:14,780 --> 01:55:18,534
Mr Osborne, everything is correct now.

1035
01:55:19,118 --> 01:55:23,247
You may take Renko here. We take
the sables. No one needs guns.

1036
01:55:23,998 --> 01:55:28,461
The sables are dead.
I do not intend to join them.

1037
01:55:29,712 --> 01:55:32,465
We're not thugs, Mr Osborne.

1038
01:55:32,548 --> 01:55:35,175
If that's what you want,
you may have our weapons.

1039
01:55:35,258 --> 01:55:38,344
- Rurik, Osborne will kill you.
- Stay out of this, you.

1040
01:55:38,428 --> 01:55:42,557
Wake up. He'll kill all
of you, except Pribluda.

1041
01:55:42,682 --> 01:55:45,143
- What?
- Pribluda is Osborne's man.

1042
01:55:45,226 --> 01:55:49,522
- That's why he'll give up his gun.
- Renko, you're a liar.

1043
01:56:07,664 --> 01:56:11,001
It's all right. Renko is unarmed.

1044
01:56:11,126 --> 01:56:15,506
- I made sure of that.
- Put the gun down.

1045
01:56:15,631 --> 01:56:19,051
- What?
- Put down the gun.

1046
01:56:24,389 --> 01:56:25,473
Jack...

1047
01:56:26,849 --> 01:56:28,726
listen.

1048
01:56:30,311 --> 01:56:32,855
I've got the money.

1049
01:56:40,571 --> 01:56:42,615
Mr Osborne.

1050
01:56:43,574 --> 01:56:46,493
On your right there are two more KGB.

1051
01:56:55,335 --> 01:56:58,255
Keep your head down.

1052
01:58:13,869 --> 01:58:16,246
Holy Peter.

1053
01:59:10,048 --> 01:59:12,883
Arkasha!

1054
01:59:13,009 --> 01:59:14,969
Irina, stay out!

1055
01:59:36,490 --> 01:59:38,533
Step out, Renko.

1056
01:59:40,285 --> 01:59:42,996
Or the girl is dead.

1057
01:59:44,289 --> 01:59:46,332
No, Arkasha.

1058
01:59:50,754 --> 01:59:52,464
Renko.

1059
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:54,231
That's a KGB gun.

1060
02:01:16,919 --> 02:01:19,588
Now we can be free.

1061
02:01:28,014 --> 02:01:29,890
Arkasha?

1062
02:01:33,894 --> 02:01:36,188
Irina.

1063
02:01:37,690 --> 02:01:40,692
I have to go back.

1064
02:01:40,817 --> 02:01:42,444
No.

1065
02:01:43,945 --> 02:01:47,991
I have to go back, otherwise
they will hunt you down.

1066
02:01:48,074 --> 02:01:50,201
That was...

1067
02:01:51,661 --> 02:01:57,000
That was the deal I made in Moscow.
Kill the sables. Kill Osborne. Go back.

1068
02:01:58,084 --> 02:02:00,795
And you could go free.

1069
02:02:02,339 --> 02:02:04,214
No.

1070
02:02:06,008 --> 02:02:07,885
No.

1071
02:02:11,430 --> 02:02:13,640
Irina, look at me.

1072
02:02:13,724 --> 02:02:16,393
No, look at me.

1073
02:02:18,896 --> 02:02:21,273
What do you see?

1074
02:02:23,150 --> 02:02:25,194
A Russian.

1075
02:02:26,236 --> 02:02:29,155
I never could be anything else.

1076
02:02:32,367 --> 02:02:34,911
- Then I'll come back.
- No.

1077
02:02:35,036 --> 02:02:37,955
You were dead there. Dying there.

1078
02:02:41,250 --> 02:02:43,711
I will always...

1079
02:02:44,879 --> 02:02:47,340
love you.

1080
02:02:49,550 --> 02:02:51,427
Arkasha.

1081
02:03:15,033 --> 02:03:17,076
One day, Irina.

1082
02:03:21,038 --> 02:03:23,082
One day.

1083
02:04:14,590 --> 02:04:18,802
Chief Investigator Renko reporting
for duty, Comrade General.

1084
02:05:03,303 --> 02:05:06,139
One day, Arkasha.

1085
02:05:06,264 --> 02:05:08,308
One day.

1086
02:05:09,305 --> 02:06:09,637
