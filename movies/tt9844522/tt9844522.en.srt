3
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:56,343
From the beginning of civilization,
we've known there's something captivating

4
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,033
about watching human beings fight
for their lives.

5
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:03,208
That's why we watch gladiator games,
public executions.

6
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,739
We created a sport for people
who still have a thirst for savagery.

7
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:08,708
What did you just do?

8
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:12,041
Our customers are some
of the most powerful people in the world.

9
00:01:12,414 --> 00:01:13,830
Real fun game, huh?

10
00:01:14,124 --> 00:01:16,341
Every year they demand more.

11
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:18,895
More complicated rooms,

12
00:01:18,998 --> 00:01:21,672
more ways to gamble on life and death.

13
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:26,417
And we provided them
with a box seat for life's ultimate drama.

14
00:01:28,612 --> 00:01:30,747
"This serves as an entry voucher..."

15
00:01:30,884 --> 00:01:32,457
"...for Minos Escape Rooms."

16
00:01:32,595 --> 00:01:34,508
Are there rules and regulations, or what?

17
00:01:34,558 --> 00:01:36,600
You have to escape
before the clock runs out.

18
00:01:36,669 --> 00:01:39,234
Anything that looks
like a puzzle or a code.

19
00:01:39,325 --> 00:01:42,449
Numbers are very important.
It could be anything, anywhere.

20
00:01:46,553 --> 00:01:48,054
Zoey, you go first.

21
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:50,371
They're watching.
They know every move we're making.

22
00:01:50,557 --> 00:01:52,683
They knew everything about us.

23
00:01:53,473 --> 00:01:55,430
Zoey! Goddamn it. Zoey!

24
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,176
She sacrificed herself for us!

25
00:02:00,715 --> 00:02:02,868
You're the psycho that designed
this murder maze, huh?

26
00:02:02,904 --> 00:02:06,322
No, I'm the Games Master.
The Puzzle Maker designs the rooms.

27
00:02:06,358 --> 00:02:07,568
Ben.

28
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:12,101
You came back for me.

29
00:02:12,137 --> 00:02:14,347
Yeah. Well, I'm tired
of being the only survivor.

30
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:16,361
I am not imagining this.

31
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:17,794
You gotta let this shit go.

32
00:02:17,895 --> 00:02:20,192
Everyone else who was sent
those invitations died,

33
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,803
and whoever sent them is still out there.

34
00:02:22,868 --> 00:02:26,341
The logo. They're coordinates
in the middle of Manhattan.

35
00:02:26,424 --> 00:02:27,565
Are you in?

36
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:28,885
Yeah, I'm in.

37
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:37,949
Tell me what you see.

38
00:02:40,886 --> 00:02:43,471
Every time I close my eyes,
I see them fall.

39
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,375
I still hear their screams.
I see their faces.

40
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,661
What else do you remember?

41
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:07,414
I remember that...

42
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:10,640
in the middle of everything,

43
00:03:11,868 --> 00:03:15,410
Amanda took the time to hold my hand,

44
00:03:15,517 --> 00:03:19,433
to tell me
that everything was gonna be okay.

45
00:03:19,714 --> 00:03:22,296
Your mother's not really gone though.

46
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,515
Be more specific?

47
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,251
I told her about my fear of flying.

48
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:34,750
I told her about my mother,
the plane crash.

49
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,911
Mom!

50
00:03:35,987 --> 00:03:37,820
Mom! Mom! Mom!

51
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:39,520
And what did she say?

52
00:03:39,674 --> 00:03:40,923
I have a daughter.

53
00:03:41,249 --> 00:03:44,000
She told me about her daughter

54
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:47,624
and how she kept her close
when she was deployed overseas.

55
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:52,783
Wanted to be sure that she'd always be
with me, so I told her,

56
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,588
when someone you love becomes a memory...

57
00:03:57,582 --> 00:03:59,708
...that memory becomes a treasure.

58
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:04,864
It sounds like Amanda was a good friend.

59
00:04:05,434 --> 00:04:06,350
She was.

60
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:12,019
But Minos killed her.
Minos killed all of them.

61
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,509
You don't believe me.

62
00:04:19,505 --> 00:04:22,379
Zoey, I'm only trying to help you.

63
00:04:22,534 --> 00:04:24,367
How can you help me
if you don't believe me?

64
00:04:25,523 --> 00:04:27,064
You think I'm insane?

65
00:04:27,402 --> 00:04:32,068
I'm only trying to communicate to you
that to a hammer,

66
00:04:32,869 --> 00:04:34,119
everything is a nail.

67
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:36,535
What is that supposed to mean?

68
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,224
It means your truth is your truth.

69
00:04:39,753 --> 00:04:42,712
But right now,
you're so deep inside the game world

70
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:45,579
that every single thing you see is a clue.

71
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:48,293
This is a clue.

72
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:51,738
This is a clue.

73
00:04:54,556 --> 00:04:55,948
This is a clue.

74
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:59,757
Everything you see reinforces
your existing beliefs

75
00:04:59,864 --> 00:05:01,864
so that you're caught in an endless loop.

76
00:05:01,962 --> 00:05:05,171
The game is all there is,
and all there is is the game.

77
00:05:38,532 --> 00:05:39,991
Sorry, our time is up.

78
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:44,903
Look, Zoey, my job isn't to believe you.

79
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:48,226
My job is to make you better.

80
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:49,409
So let me ask you:

81
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,958
What would it take for you
to be free from this?

82
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,715
What would it take?

83
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:59,292
Yes! Take that trip to New York
you keep talking about.

84
00:05:59,387 --> 00:06:01,512
The one with Ben
that you keep postponing.

85
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,749
You've tried to fly three times.

86
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:05,666
- I can't do this.
- Okay, let's go.

87
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,457
- No, no.
- Hey, Zoey!

88
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:10,649
Yeah, I wanted
to run that by you, actually.

89
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:14,345
We're thinking of driving there.

90
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:19,593
What would it take
to finally get you on that plane?

91
00:06:19,882 --> 00:06:22,283
Because that's what we want,
isn't it, Zoey?

92
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,515
To get you on that plane?

93
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,341
I need to know that the criminals
who killed the four people in front of me

94
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,416
are held accountable for what they did.

95
00:06:30,485 --> 00:06:31,484
It's okay.

96
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:35,178
And I need to know
that they're never going to do it again

97
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:36,889
to me or to anyone else.

98
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:38,768
Then...

99
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,621
and only then, will this all be over.

100
00:06:43,345 --> 00:06:44,262
Hey, Ben.

101
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:45,978
- Hey.
- Hey.

102
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,208
What'd she say?

103
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:50,183
She thinks that driving to New York

104
00:06:50,251 --> 00:06:52,710
is a way of avoiding
my underlying fear of flying.

105
00:06:53,637 --> 00:06:57,345
But you know me. The best way to get me
to do something is tell me not to do it.

106
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:00,577
What does that mean?

107
00:07:00,945 --> 00:07:02,819
Let's do it. Let's drive.

108
00:07:03,987 --> 00:07:07,653
There have been trucks going in
and out of that building for three days.

109
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:09,915
They wouldn't embed
their coordinates into the company logo

110
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,437
if it didn't mean something, Ben.

111
00:07:12,303 --> 00:07:13,861
You were gonna fly with me.

112
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:18,276
It's just these past few weeks,
I've kind of really,

113
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:21,129
really enjoyed not dying.

114
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:22,608
Would you stop?

115
00:07:22,723 --> 00:07:25,084
If we get lucky, we can take some photos.

116
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:27,853
It'll be more evidence
than we have now, which is nothing.

117
00:07:28,607 --> 00:07:29,939
Okay, yeah.

118
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:33,127
Sure you don't wanna stop in Cleveland?

119
00:07:33,226 --> 00:07:35,351
Ben, I said no detours.

120
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,135
I know this is a lot to ask,
so thank you for coming with me.

121
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,216
Well, I have this... weird loyalty thing

122
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:46,135
for people who save my life.

123
00:07:48,664 --> 00:07:49,704
Thanks.

124
00:07:50,975 --> 00:07:53,392
Well, don't thank me too much.

125
00:07:54,257 --> 00:07:55,883
I don't have any gas money.

126
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:59,154
Actually don't have any money.

127
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:04,072
No. I'm not spending the next two days
in a car full of smoke with you.

128
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,841
Should we go to bed?

129
00:08:12,838 --> 00:08:14,795
- Are you tired?
- No.

130
00:08:14,981 --> 00:08:16,064
But....

131
00:08:17,127 --> 00:08:18,668
we should try, right?

132
00:08:20,563 --> 00:08:21,646
Yeah.

133
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,589
- Go ahead. No, you go.
- You go. You stood up first.

134
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:31,429
No, no, no. You go. No, go.

135
00:08:31,518 --> 00:08:32,850
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

136
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,290
Smooth move, man.

137
00:09:01,096 --> 00:09:01,970
Okay.

138
00:09:04,863 --> 00:09:08,240
Ben? Ben, it's locked! I can't get out!

139
00:09:08,305 --> 00:09:10,639
- Zoey? Zoey!
- Ben! Ben! I can't get out!

140
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,300
Come on! We gotta go!

141
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,233
Zoey!

142
00:09:16,342 --> 00:09:18,134
No, no, no. No!

143
00:09:18,616 --> 00:09:19,532
Shit!

144
00:09:21,898 --> 00:09:23,440
No, no, no! No!

145
00:09:26,368 --> 00:09:27,660
Oh, shit!

146
00:09:31,144 --> 00:09:32,144
No, no, no!

147
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,451
No! No, no, no!

148
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:45,243
Shit. Oh, shit.

149
00:09:46,937 --> 00:09:49,439
Hey, hey, hey. What's wrong? What's wrong?

150
00:09:49,514 --> 00:09:51,223
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God.

151
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,906
Oh, shit.

152
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,580
Hey, I think you just had a nightmare.

153
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,451
I saw... I saw the...

154
00:10:00,153 --> 00:10:01,695
The whole thing was just...

155
00:10:02,132 --> 00:10:03,091
Just a dream.

156
00:10:03,221 --> 00:10:05,763
Yeah. It was just...

157
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:08,048
- We gotta get these guys.
- Yeah.

158
00:10:08,837 --> 00:10:10,546
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

159
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:13,746
We're almost there.

160
00:10:13,892 --> 00:10:15,542
It's an abandoned government building.

161
00:10:15,626 --> 00:10:17,334
There's no record, there's no deed.

162
00:10:17,441 --> 00:10:19,024
It's a total black hole.

163
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,330
This is it. We're here.

164
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:32,617
Looks like Minos went out of business.

165
00:10:34,265 --> 00:10:36,361
Are we sure we got the coordinates right?

166
00:10:36,564 --> 00:10:38,438
This doesn't make any sense.

167
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:46,233
Look. This was from two days ago.
It's filled with workers.

168
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,541
This has to be the right place.

169
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:58,001
Can we just circle the perimeter
before we enter this hell-trap nightmare?

170
00:10:58,106 --> 00:11:00,065
- You can stay out here.
- That's not what I meant.

171
00:11:00,405 --> 00:11:01,905
Hey, just stop.

172
00:11:03,313 --> 00:11:04,771
Wait, no. Zoey.

173
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:12,429
Can we just look at the coordinates again?
Maybe we got a number wrong.

174
00:11:13,113 --> 00:11:13,946
Come on. I...

175
00:11:16,622 --> 00:11:18,016
We shouldn't be in here.

176
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:21,345
We need answers. We came this far,
we have to figure this out.

177
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,825
It's all locked. There's no use.

178
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,290
- No!
- There's nothing in there.

179
00:11:26,328 --> 00:11:28,279
Let's just retrace the steps.

180
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:30,519
- There has to be something in here.
- Hey!

181
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:32,804
What's up, guys?

182
00:11:32,945 --> 00:11:36,804
You guys shouldn't be here.
It's not safe. This place is condemned.

183
00:11:36,893 --> 00:11:38,345
Yeah, I think...

184
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:40,781
I mean, I can help you get in there.

185
00:11:42,981 --> 00:11:44,772
I haven't eaten
in a couple of days though.

186
00:11:44,852 --> 00:11:49,184
- Can you maybe help me out?
- Look, I don't... Hey!

187
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,334
- Hey!
- What the hell? Come on, stop!

188
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:53,606
- Come back!
- Come on, get back here!

189
00:11:55,077 --> 00:11:55,910
Stop!

190
00:12:00,991 --> 00:12:02,949
Stop him! Come on!

191
00:12:03,198 --> 00:12:04,280
Hey!

192
00:12:05,513 --> 00:12:07,346
- Hey!
- Stop!

193
00:12:08,356 --> 00:12:09,189
Watch it!

194
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,541
Slow down!

195
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,525
Out of the way!

196
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:19,957
Hey!

197
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,940
Somebody stop him!

198
00:12:24,634 --> 00:12:26,343
- Ben!
- Zoey, come on!

199
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,633
Assholes.

200
00:12:29,322 --> 00:12:31,573
Hey! Get back here, man!

201
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:38,136
- Hey!
- Get him! Get him!

202
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,412
No, no, no. No.

203
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:46,215
Oh, shit.

204
00:12:47,026 --> 00:12:50,609
Okay, look,
we'll find a cop at the next station.

205
00:12:50,676 --> 00:12:53,002
Maybe there's some surveillance footage
or something.

206
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,708
No, there's no point. It's gone.

207
00:12:57,574 --> 00:12:58,740
That was my mom's.

208
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,630
I'm sorry.

209
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:10,200
Look, we should get off at the next stop
and go back to the building.

210
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,583
- Yeah.
- There's something there, I know it.

211
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:15,376
Yeah. We're gonna find our own way in.

212
00:13:15,892 --> 00:13:16,809
No matter what.

213
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:21,186
Just, new rule,
no more talking to junkies.

214
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:25,669
Hey, baby. You're not gonna believe
where I am right now.

215
00:13:26,183 --> 00:13:28,224
No, I am on the train.

216
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:30,758
I couldn't get the damn thing
to start this morning.

217
00:13:30,854 --> 00:13:32,229
Had to leave the car at the gym.

218
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:36,058
Yeah, I know.
I'll take care of it tomorrow.

219
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,096
Because! Listen, when I make my baby
a promise, I keep it.

220
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:42,711
Okay.

221
00:13:43,932 --> 00:13:47,249
Hey, that was one time.
Your mother doesn't like...

222
00:13:47,335 --> 00:13:48,335
Do you hear that?

223
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:51,112
Train noises.

224
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:58,995
Yeah, I hear that.

225
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:10,681
What's going on?

226
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:12,290
Isn't the conductor supposed
to be in here?

227
00:14:12,372 --> 00:14:14,038
Yeah. I don't know.

228
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,295
- Hey.
- What just happened?

229
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:33,091
That's bad, right? Holy shit.

230
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,182
Hey, baby, I'll call you back, okay?

231
00:14:35,255 --> 00:14:38,338
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know. The train just uncoupled!

232
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:40,667
- What do you mean, uncoupled?
- They separated!

233
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:42,709
- What do I do?
- I don't know!

234
00:14:42,814 --> 00:14:45,730
- Hit the button!
- I have hit the button!

235
00:14:48,826 --> 00:14:49,909
- Hey!
- Hey!

236
00:14:57,323 --> 00:14:59,532
Hey! Hold on to something!

237
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:02,653
- Stop touching shit!
- Do something!

238
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,291
Shit! Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

239
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:12,189
Baby?

240
00:15:14,255 --> 00:15:15,923
Tiff, can you hear me?

241
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:17,391
Oh, shit.

242
00:15:19,258 --> 00:15:20,718
Is that the end of the track?

243
00:15:21,002 --> 00:15:22,252
Oh, no, no, no!

244
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:28,900
- Run! Run!
- Go, go, go!

245
00:15:42,061 --> 00:15:43,935
Hey. Hey!

246
00:15:44,847 --> 00:15:46,721
Hey. Let me see.

247
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:48,915
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, you?

248
00:15:49,675 --> 00:15:50,967
Okay, you're not bleeding.

249
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,175
Where are we?

250
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,203
My head.

251
00:16:09,588 --> 00:16:12,129
- Okay.
- Come on. Get up, you got this.

252
00:16:12,213 --> 00:16:13,587
Come on, come on.

253
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,723
Is everyone okay?

254
00:16:16,172 --> 00:16:17,463
Hey, man, you're leaking.

255
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:23,064
- Don't you think it's early for that?
- This day just gets better and better.

256
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,026
How long you think
till someone comes for us?

257
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,431
I don't know. It's like 100 miles
of derelict track down here.

258
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:35,328
And no one knows where the hell we are,
so I'd say long as hell.

259
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,457
Great.

260
00:16:37,545 --> 00:16:38,876
I'm not getting a signal.

261
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:41,130
Let me know when the cavalry arrives.

262
00:16:41,222 --> 00:16:42,222
Hold on a second.

263
00:16:42,818 --> 00:16:44,651
Looks like we're in an abandoned station.

264
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,085
You're shitting, right?

265
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:49,418
Hey!

266
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,134
Hello?

267
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,422
Hey, you got six people trapped in here.
Somebody sending help?

268
00:16:58,383 --> 00:17:00,058
Attention, passengers.

269
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,348
Keep your belongings
in sight at all times.

270
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:07,641
If you see a suspicious package,
please tell the nearest MTA employee.

271
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,292
Remain alert and good luck.

272
00:17:13,604 --> 00:17:15,063
Minos found us.

273
00:17:17,522 --> 00:17:19,230
Did you just say "Minos"?

274
00:17:19,516 --> 00:17:21,434
It's happening again.

275
00:17:22,852 --> 00:17:24,227
No. No.

276
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:27,843
No. No, no, no.

277
00:17:27,935 --> 00:17:31,102
No, I knew I shouldn't have
come back. Oh, my God.

278
00:17:31,193 --> 00:17:33,625
Wait. What, you guys have played
the game before?

279
00:17:33,722 --> 00:17:37,931
How do you think I got this, huh?
They locked me in a goddamn submarine.

280
00:17:39,237 --> 00:17:41,780
Then they increased the air pressure
until my eardrums burst.

281
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,227
So that makes this what?

282
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:46,794
Tournament of champions?

283
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:49,880
No. No!

284
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:52,255
No! No!

285
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:55,456
Let me out!

286
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:59,034
I'm not playing this game again,
you no-good pieces of shit!

287
00:17:59,094 --> 00:18:01,301
Hey, hey, hey! You're making it worse!

288
00:18:01,393 --> 00:18:03,602
Don't make it worse, okay?
Don't make it worse.

289
00:18:05,068 --> 00:18:08,735
If they can hijack a train,
they can reinforce the doors, okay?

290
00:18:08,872 --> 00:18:10,665
It's my wife's birthday today.

291
00:18:13,313 --> 00:18:14,853
I told her I wouldn't be late.

292
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,709
I'm always late.

293
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:29,164
I should've done more.
I should've convinced you not to come.

294
00:18:29,263 --> 00:18:31,012
Ben, Ben, Ben. Look at me.

295
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:34,743
Look, we broke out once.
We'll do it again. I promise, okay?

296
00:18:35,695 --> 00:18:38,065
You gotta get
that fantasy out of your head.

297
00:18:38,172 --> 00:18:41,505
Okay, we've all been through this before.
We solve the puzzles, we win.

298
00:18:41,948 --> 00:18:44,948
- We go free.
- You mean, one of us does.

299
00:18:48,865 --> 00:18:50,114
What's that sound?

300
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:05,148
What the hell is that?

301
00:19:37,013 --> 00:19:39,887
- No.
- I don't like the sound of that.

302
00:19:56,451 --> 00:19:58,315
Shit! Shit, I just got shocked.

303
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,050
- You all right?
- Yeah.

304
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:02,008
They electrified the entire car?

305
00:20:02,092 --> 00:20:05,102
We all know how this works.
We play the game or we die.

306
00:20:05,188 --> 00:20:09,183
This is exactly what they want us to do,
dance for their amusement.

307
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,217
I don't know about you,
but I'm not dying on nobody's Q Train.

308
00:20:15,804 --> 00:20:17,622
Attention, passengers.

309
00:20:17,724 --> 00:20:20,838
Keep your belongings
in sight at all times.

310
00:20:20,915 --> 00:20:25,499
If you see a suspicious package,
please tell the nearest MTA employee.

311
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:27,999
Remain alert and good luck.

312
00:20:28,067 --> 00:20:31,025
Hey, I found a bag.
This belong to any of you?

313
00:20:31,658 --> 00:20:32,575
What's in it?

314
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:37,463
There's a towel...

315
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,277
- Oh, shit.
- Hey, careful, bro.

316
00:20:43,115 --> 00:20:46,282
Okay. Let's find out
what that handle goes to.

317
00:20:46,575 --> 00:20:47,756
Everyone split up.

318
00:20:47,993 --> 00:20:50,642
- All right. Careful about the poles.
- Seriously, homeys.

319
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:52,585
It's gotta be to one of the doors.

320
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,460
The handle's metal
so we need to be careful.

321
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:11,542
- I think I found the way out.
- Does it need the handle?

322
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,234
No. It's a trapdoor.
There's gotta be another way to open it.

323
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:17,207
Jesus Christ. Come on, guys.
You aren't listening to the whole clue.

324
00:21:17,301 --> 00:21:21,300
They said report any of this shit
to the MTA employee, right? Right?

325
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,831
That's the conductor booth.

326
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:25,430
- Just give me the damn thing.
- Will you be careful?

327
00:21:25,531 --> 00:21:27,905
Yeah. We don't have a choice, all right?

328
00:21:28,943 --> 00:21:30,152
Shit!

329
00:21:33,517 --> 00:21:35,850
Hope you enjoyed that, assholes.

330
00:21:37,204 --> 00:21:38,245
Wait a minute.

331
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:41,584
- Leather's an insulator.
- Yeah, yeah, that's smart.

332
00:21:44,154 --> 00:21:44,988
Okay.

333
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:51,243
Hey, it worked!

334
00:22:02,212 --> 00:22:03,087
Shit!

335
00:22:03,303 --> 00:22:04,721
- You okay?
- Yeah.

336
00:22:05,174 --> 00:22:06,383
Playing makes it worse.

337
00:22:06,613 --> 00:22:09,406
It's... It's one
of those old subway token slots.

338
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:11,655
I haven't seen one since I was a kid.

339
00:22:11,735 --> 00:22:15,162
Okay, so we need tokens.
Anyone see any tokens anywhere?

340
00:22:15,261 --> 00:22:16,386
What does that sign say?

341
00:22:16,777 --> 00:22:20,751
"All false advertising must be pulled."
Maybe the tokens are behind the ads?

342
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,221
But the frames are metal,
so we need a tool to pull them off.

343
00:22:23,365 --> 00:22:25,407
No, wait. "All false advertising."

344
00:22:25,524 --> 00:22:27,983
Yeah, I noticed something earlier.

345
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:31,008
Right here.
This ad for Hourglass Bay, it says:

346
00:22:31,044 --> 00:22:33,585
"Lose yourself in the sand."
"Yourself" is missing an E.

347
00:22:33,783 --> 00:22:37,491
Check all the signage. See if there are
any more misspellings. Okay?

348
00:22:40,298 --> 00:22:41,132
Nothing.

349
00:22:43,047 --> 00:22:44,250
Here! C.

350
00:22:44,335 --> 00:22:46,308
There's a C missing in "statistic."

351
00:22:46,344 --> 00:22:49,968
Okay, C, E...
They're trying to spell something out.

352
00:22:50,051 --> 00:22:52,593
Wait, wait, wait. What did the clue say?

353
00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:54,331
"All false advertising must be pulled."

354
00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:55,826
The missing letters...

355
00:22:56,758 --> 00:22:59,593
Has everybody noticed
how many handles there are?

356
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,962
- Who counts how many...?
- Twenty-six.

357
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,956
- Like letters in the alphabet.
- Right.

358
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:06,292
We pull the corresponding handles
of the missing letters.

359
00:23:06,328 --> 00:23:09,577
The metal handles?
I hope no one has a heart condition.

360
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:10,842
What if we use the towel?

361
00:23:10,878 --> 00:23:12,752
No, cotton is not a good enough insulator.

362
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,263
Is there anything else in the bag?

363
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,869
Wait, the lining is rubber.
We could use this.

364
00:23:17,924 --> 00:23:19,937
Does anybody have keys, so I can cut it?

365
00:23:20,972 --> 00:23:22,347
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here.

366
00:23:27,691 --> 00:23:29,401
Does anybody wanna hand me keys?

367
00:23:31,722 --> 00:23:32,763
My bad.

368
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:37,071
Pass them down.

369
00:23:37,903 --> 00:23:40,352
Great. We're rubbered up.
Which one are we pulling?

370
00:23:40,388 --> 00:23:42,429
Hey, there's a green handle here!

371
00:23:42,507 --> 00:23:45,507
I noticed a red one at the other end.
Green is A, red is Z, right?

372
00:23:45,897 --> 00:23:47,231
Maybe this is where we start.

373
00:23:47,321 --> 00:23:49,572
Okay. C is the third letter
of the alphabet, so...

374
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:53,578
Okay. Any objections?

375
00:23:53,926 --> 00:23:55,301
No, go for it.

376
00:23:55,337 --> 00:23:57,795
No. You got this.

377
00:24:05,836 --> 00:24:06,920
A C, that's one.

378
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:11,355
Hey, look! Letters. Two Cs.
That's gotta mean something, right?

379
00:24:15,591 --> 00:24:16,549
It's getting worse.

380
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:19,401
- Come on, keep moving!
- Go, go, go!

381
00:24:21,362 --> 00:24:22,610
- Come on!
- No shock.

382
00:24:22,696 --> 00:24:25,377
It must be grounded.
We need eight more tokens.

383
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:30,205
Okay. "Lose yourself." A, B, C, D, E.

384
00:24:32,476 --> 00:24:35,214
- Yes!
- Everybody split up, look for letters.

385
00:24:35,403 --> 00:24:36,903
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

386
00:24:38,026 --> 00:24:39,485
Shit, we're running out of time.

387
00:24:40,274 --> 00:24:41,481
Seven!

388
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,893
Check the back of the train.
Gotta be something there.

389
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:47,097
What the hell
does half this shit even mean?

390
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,702
There's an extra M here!

391
00:24:48,785 --> 00:24:51,578
- And an A! There's an A missing.
- I'll get the A!

392
00:24:52,501 --> 00:24:55,044
M! M! Ready?

393
00:24:55,701 --> 00:24:56,701
Go!

394
00:24:58,158 --> 00:24:59,241
We need five more!

395
00:25:02,263 --> 00:25:03,596
Oh, my God. Hey!

396
00:25:04,118 --> 00:25:04,952
Oh, God!

397
00:25:05,028 --> 00:25:06,402
- I'll get the token.
- She okay?

398
00:25:06,675 --> 00:25:07,645
- I got you.
- She okay?

399
00:25:07,741 --> 00:25:09,783
- She's fine. Keep going.
- Where's the token?

400
00:25:09,819 --> 00:25:10,860
This is missing a K!

401
00:25:11,108 --> 00:25:13,817
"Call a cab in advance."
There's an extra L here too.

402
00:25:13,949 --> 00:25:15,408
All right. Back to L!

403
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,905
- You got the L? Okay!
- I got L!

404
00:25:17,988 --> 00:25:21,197
- Five more.
- Oh, shit. It's a game of Hangman.

405
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,327
This is gonna suck!

406
00:25:30,736 --> 00:25:33,810
- This can't be happening.
- Hey! Give me the token!

407
00:25:33,973 --> 00:25:35,264
Give me the token!

408
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:37,226
Go, man, go!

409
00:25:38,683 --> 00:25:40,183
Everybody stay down!

410
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:43,962
Get up, Theo, get up!

411
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,528
- Zoey, what are you doing?
- It's the proof we came here for!

412
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:50,896
- Get down!
- Hurry up!

413
00:25:52,383 --> 00:25:54,466
Where are the other letters?

414
00:26:01,865 --> 00:26:02,781
There's three!

415
00:26:14,268 --> 00:26:16,810
Guys! Guys, I found the missing letter...

416
00:26:39,953 --> 00:26:40,868
He's dead!

417
00:26:41,265 --> 00:26:42,432
Oh, shit.

418
00:26:45,962 --> 00:26:49,169
- Do we know what letters he found?
- No, the map is burnt out!

419
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:53,614
Zoey! Got any ideas?

420
00:26:59,528 --> 00:27:01,903
The missing letters are W, B, and O!

421
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:04,872
- How do you know?
- I just know. Just do it!

422
00:27:15,363 --> 00:27:16,530
B, O!

423
00:27:25,415 --> 00:27:26,914
Go!

424
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:38,041
One more!

425
00:27:39,517 --> 00:27:40,892
I'm coming!

426
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,534
- Sleep well, brother.
- Oh, shit!

427
00:27:44,261 --> 00:27:46,862
Hand it to me! Give me the token!

428
00:27:56,043 --> 00:27:57,395
The door is open!

429
00:27:57,474 --> 00:28:00,807
All right! Go! Go, go! Get out of here!

430
00:28:04,107 --> 00:28:05,523
Come on, go!

431
00:28:11,158 --> 00:28:12,616
Zoey, hurry! Jump!

432
00:28:20,902 --> 00:28:22,567
Everybody stay down!

433
00:28:23,421 --> 00:28:24,421
Stay down!

434
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:29,001
We're moving!

435
00:28:30,053 --> 00:28:31,094
We're going down.

436
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:49,526
Hey, wait. Somebody just died.
Can we just have a moment?

437
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:54,153
Maybe we should have a minute of silence.
I mean, we did just lose somebody.

438
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:57,317
You can be as silent as you want.
They're eating this shit up.

439
00:28:57,948 --> 00:28:59,948
Anybody even know his name?

440
00:29:03,192 --> 00:29:04,026
No.

441
00:29:06,264 --> 00:29:07,305
I'm Brianna.

442
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:09,012
I'm Nate.

443
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:10,948
I'm Rachel.

444
00:29:11,663 --> 00:29:12,580
I'm Ben.

445
00:29:13,197 --> 00:29:14,281
Zoey.

446
00:29:16,828 --> 00:29:19,855
Hey, did the train mean anything
to anybody?

447
00:29:19,937 --> 00:29:23,229
It was horrible. We almost died.
Does that count?

448
00:29:23,297 --> 00:29:26,714
No, no, I mean,
this is all part of a puzzle, right?

449
00:29:26,787 --> 00:29:30,187
So for our groups,
we were all lone survivors.

450
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,175
So if the rooms were tailored
around our accidents...

451
00:29:33,284 --> 00:29:35,826
Maybe the last room was designed
for the guy who died in it.

452
00:29:35,996 --> 00:29:39,080
Okay, well, what about your groups?

453
00:29:39,418 --> 00:29:43,140
- Do you think there was any connection?
- My group was all influencers.

454
00:29:43,219 --> 00:29:45,886
What, so your special skills were selfies?

455
00:29:46,055 --> 00:29:49,308
No, my special skill was travel blogging.

456
00:29:49,398 --> 00:29:53,022
Camping in Atacama,
elephant sanctuaries in Thailand.

457
00:29:53,702 --> 00:29:54,826
That kind of thing.

458
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:59,556
Got a million followers, made some money,
and then this scar happened.

459
00:29:59,972 --> 00:30:02,180
My last room was
an exploding hall of mirrors.

460
00:30:02,515 --> 00:30:05,306
It's just a weird category, is all.

461
00:30:05,861 --> 00:30:07,694
I got a letter from my diocese.

462
00:30:07,902 --> 00:30:09,736
Oh, so you're a priest?

463
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:16,949
It called me to some interchurch seminar
or something.

464
00:30:17,794 --> 00:30:20,878
- When I get there...
- Let me guess. Five more priests?

465
00:30:21,516 --> 00:30:23,225
Beginning of a bad joke, right?

466
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:30,689
You see, in ours they wanted to see
if faith helped us survive.

467
00:30:31,888 --> 00:30:34,179
Well, you survived.

468
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:40,053
I keep walking around up there, so lost.

469
00:30:42,977 --> 00:30:43,894
I mean,

470
00:30:44,577 --> 00:30:47,327
- I just don't understand.
- Understand what?

471
00:30:48,435 --> 00:30:50,061
Why God spared me.

472
00:30:51,363 --> 00:30:52,593
Maybe that's enough story time...

473
00:30:52,698 --> 00:30:54,115
Wait, wait, wait.

474
00:30:54,226 --> 00:30:56,559
When I won the game,

475
00:30:56,595 --> 00:31:00,138
some vaguely European asshole tried
to strangle me to death.

476
00:31:00,681 --> 00:31:02,561
Only reason I got out was because of Zoey.

477
00:31:02,642 --> 00:31:06,369
So, what, they just let you all go free?

478
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:09,583
They gave me a hug, called me an Uber.
It was a really pleasant experience.

479
00:31:09,653 --> 00:31:13,026
We're just trying to find a pattern.
That's it. That's all.

480
00:31:13,108 --> 00:31:15,899
They're betting on something.
What's the angle?

481
00:31:16,006 --> 00:31:17,797
You can't outthink Minos.

482
00:31:17,873 --> 00:31:20,648
Trying to is just going
to put us all at risk.

483
00:31:20,763 --> 00:31:23,655
She's the only one here
who saved somebody except for herself,

484
00:31:23,691 --> 00:31:26,067
- so why not listen to her?
- I heard you on the train.

485
00:31:26,103 --> 00:31:28,895
Sounds like listening to her is
what got you back into this mess.

486
00:31:33,577 --> 00:31:35,035
Maybe we should keep moving.

487
00:31:52,915 --> 00:31:55,831
An art deco bank of death. Great.

488
00:31:55,954 --> 00:31:57,745
They built a bank underground?

489
00:31:58,911 --> 00:32:00,036
This is crazy.

490
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,430
Look, the vault door's open.

491
00:32:05,543 --> 00:32:08,417
- There's no way it's that easy.
- Yeah, definitely not.

492
00:32:08,763 --> 00:32:11,971
- Clearly, they're baiting us.
- Yeah, you think?

493
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,185
Zoey? What's wrong?

494
00:32:18,196 --> 00:32:19,321
Goddamn it!

495
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,462
Security system activated.

496
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,128
Nobody touch anything.

497
00:32:34,672 --> 00:32:37,794
It's the tile.
You need to step both feet off of it.

498
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,881
- It's triggering the lasers.
- Help me.

499
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,522
- I'm gonna guide you.
- I'm stuck.

500
00:32:41,618 --> 00:32:42,909
Take my hand.

501
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:44,625
Just listen to me.

502
00:32:44,731 --> 00:32:47,275
Lower your body. Nice and slow.

503
00:32:48,138 --> 00:32:49,138
Slow.

504
00:32:49,237 --> 00:32:51,514
- Steady. Careful.
- Wait, wait, wait.

505
00:32:51,588 --> 00:32:54,380
You're gonna lift your left foot
and bring it over to me.

506
00:32:54,574 --> 00:32:55,375
Yeah, good.

507
00:32:55,493 --> 00:32:59,702
When you're ready. There you go.
Over to me. Nice and slow.

508
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:00,932
Really low. You got it.

509
00:33:01,003 --> 00:33:04,044
- I got you.
- A little bit lower. You got it.

510
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,534
On the count of three.

511
00:33:05,876 --> 00:33:06,835
Three.

512
00:33:07,408 --> 00:33:08,324
- Two.
- Two.

513
00:33:08,648 --> 00:33:10,190
- One.
- One.

514
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,430
Shit.

515
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,533
- Is she okay?
- No, no, don't.

516
00:33:14,616 --> 00:33:15,951
I know. Don't touch it.

517
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:18,991
Yeah. It looks like
the skin is fused to the shirt.

518
00:33:19,949 --> 00:33:21,847
Full laser-grid activation

519
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,661
- in ten minutes.
- Oh, shit.

520
00:33:23,758 --> 00:33:25,050
That is the way out.

521
00:33:25,181 --> 00:33:27,556
There has to be another way
across those tiles.

522
00:33:27,646 --> 00:33:29,272
We can't exactly test them.

523
00:33:30,129 --> 00:33:32,087
- Maybe we can go around?
- Great.

524
00:33:32,164 --> 00:33:33,913
Might as well be a mile away.

525
00:33:35,248 --> 00:33:37,497
Hey, guys? I think I found a key.

526
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,918
- Inside the lollipop. It's a key, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

527
00:33:44,588 --> 00:33:48,546
Well, those are safety-deposit boxes.
It's gotta be for one of them.

528
00:33:51,594 --> 00:33:54,137
Wait, we don't know
if it's safe over there yet.

529
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,088
This is where the clue leads.

530
00:33:58,983 --> 00:34:01,524
These tiles are different
than the ones in the middle, so...

531
00:34:04,222 --> 00:34:05,222
Zoey, be careful.

532
00:34:05,283 --> 00:34:07,449
Clock's ticking. We have no choice.

533
00:34:12,046 --> 00:34:12,879
Safe.

534
00:34:13,768 --> 00:34:15,577
Okay. Look for some more keys.

535
00:34:15,683 --> 00:34:17,475
There's more boxes on the other side.

536
00:34:17,817 --> 00:34:19,483
See if we can find any more.

537
00:34:24,751 --> 00:34:25,918
"You are here"?

538
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,730
No shit.

539
00:34:31,058 --> 00:34:33,100
There's too many boxes.
We're missing something.

540
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:36,455
"To be filed." Where is it?

541
00:34:43,104 --> 00:34:44,563
- Found a key.
- Yes!

542
00:34:44,685 --> 00:34:46,018
I found another key!

543
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:49,184
- Try the boxes on the other side.
- We'll check over there.

544
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:54,583
Brianna. Come on.

545
00:34:58,894 --> 00:35:01,184
Okay, this is gonna take a while.

546
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:07,161
Full laser-grid activation
in eight minutes.

547
00:35:07,236 --> 00:35:09,069
I hate these sons of bitches.

548
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,295
You guys hear that?

549
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,694
Welcome to Illuminus Bank.

550
00:35:16,227 --> 00:35:20,519
For payment following the death
of a loved one, please enter your PIN.

551
00:35:20,937 --> 00:35:21,769
PIN.

552
00:35:22,427 --> 00:35:25,219
We need a PIN code.
What's that? Four numbers.

553
00:35:25,317 --> 00:35:27,900
Four numbers? Yeah, okay.
We're looking for four numbers.

554
00:35:27,968 --> 00:35:30,593
Let's see, is there one...?
Shit. All these are three.

555
00:35:30,654 --> 00:35:33,438
"Enter your PIN. Follow instructions.
Don't forget to take your receipt."

556
00:35:33,493 --> 00:35:35,995
"Payment." Briefcases?
"Following the death of a loved one."

557
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:40,291
Full laser-grid activation
in seven minutes.

558
00:35:40,327 --> 00:35:42,195
Hey, come here. Check this out.

559
00:35:42,283 --> 00:35:44,325
All the boxes have numbers
except for this one.

560
00:35:44,533 --> 00:35:47,074
"Sonya." Who's Sonya?

561
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:49,055
Oh, my God.

562
00:35:49,644 --> 00:35:52,352
Here. Only one way to find out.

563
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:54,263
Come on, come on.

564
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:01,409
Rachel, look, there's something in here.

565
00:36:02,447 --> 00:36:05,738
Shit! Shit, that's really sharp.
I'm bleeding.

566
00:36:05,807 --> 00:36:09,783
We got a box with the name "Sonya" on it
and some razor-sharp diamonds.

567
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:11,943
- Anything else?
- We got a box like that too.

568
00:36:12,008 --> 00:36:16,148
It says "Sonya" on it.
And there's two stacks of blank bills.

569
00:36:16,219 --> 00:36:17,802
- I don't know what it means.
- Okay.

570
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:22,108
Full laser-grid activation in six minutes.

571
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:24,872
Sharp diamonds, blank bills,
and a chick named Sonya.

572
00:36:24,995 --> 00:36:26,412
We're missing something.

573
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:29,075
"Following the payment
of a death of a loved one."

574
00:36:29,878 --> 00:36:33,170
Wait. What do you call it
when you get paid for a death?

575
00:36:34,088 --> 00:36:36,379
Blood money.
Hurry, bring the bills over here.

576
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,318
They want us to put blood on the bills.

577
00:36:38,408 --> 00:36:40,033
Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, yeah.

578
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:49,768
- Oh, no!
- Rachel!

579
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:51,843
Rachel?

580
00:36:52,475 --> 00:36:53,643
Rachel.

581
00:36:54,164 --> 00:36:55,369
Hey. Are you okay?

582
00:36:55,453 --> 00:36:56,870
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

583
00:36:56,906 --> 00:36:58,990
- Counters are off-limits.
- Okay.

584
00:36:59,071 --> 00:37:01,260
- Priest guy, get the bills.
- The bills okay?

585
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:03,083
- Yeah, this one's good.
- All right.

586
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,161
- Bring them here. Careful.
- I hope that's enough.

587
00:37:06,172 --> 00:37:07,506
Okay. Here.

588
00:37:10,282 --> 00:37:12,698
Oh, what is that? Okay.

589
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:14,511
It's working.

590
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,730
Okay, 0-5-2-6. Try that.
Try 0-5-2-6 in the ATM.

591
00:37:17,813 --> 00:37:19,229
0-5-2-6.

592
00:37:19,397 --> 00:37:21,023
0-5-2-6.

593
00:37:21,417 --> 00:37:22,249
The clocks!

594
00:37:24,054 --> 00:37:24,971
Everyone see that?

595
00:37:25,023 --> 00:37:30,065
They stopped moving at 12:09 in New York,
3:02 in London, and 12:03 in Shanghai.

596
00:37:30,734 --> 00:37:32,431
How does that get us across the floor?

597
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:34,300
Hang on. We got another clue.

598
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,677
What is it?

599
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,318
"Plot a course by the hours of the day.
Count the minutes every step of the way."

600
00:37:40,737 --> 00:37:44,242
Okay, maybe it's coordinates
like in chess. Row and column?

601
00:37:44,316 --> 00:37:45,808
No, wait. I see it.

602
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,693
"Plot a course by the hours."

603
00:37:47,771 --> 00:37:50,176
Twelve o'clock is straight.
Three o'clock is right.

604
00:37:50,212 --> 00:37:53,188
That makes sense. So "Count the steps
every minute" must be the distance

605
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:56,685
and that means
that 12:09 is straight, nine steps?

606
00:37:57,172 --> 00:37:58,889
Full laser-grid activation

607
00:37:59,032 --> 00:38:01,741
- in five minutes.
- How do we know where to start from?

608
00:38:04,141 --> 00:38:06,337
This says you start three tiles
from the left.

609
00:38:06,373 --> 00:38:09,332
- Three tiles from the left!
- At least, I think so.

610
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:11,658
I don't know.
We're making a lot of assumptions.

611
00:38:11,868 --> 00:38:13,701
We gotta try something, right?

612
00:38:13,775 --> 00:38:15,276
Wait, I have an idea.

613
00:38:15,328 --> 00:38:17,453
What are you...? Where are you going?

614
00:38:20,377 --> 00:38:22,335
I'm gonna plot a course
for the rest of you.

615
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:24,501
Careful, okay?

616
00:38:33,368 --> 00:38:35,993
Okay. It worked. Okay.

617
00:38:36,442 --> 00:38:37,485
One.

618
00:38:38,546 --> 00:38:39,546
Two.

619
00:38:41,201 --> 00:38:42,243
Three.

620
00:38:43,008 --> 00:38:44,675
- Come on.
- You're doing great, Nate.

621
00:38:49,608 --> 00:38:51,067
Okay. Okay.

622
00:38:51,282 --> 00:38:53,240
- Nine? Nine. Okay.
- That's nine, right?

623
00:38:53,301 --> 00:38:56,800
So it's 3:02 in London,
so try two steps to your right.

624
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,991
Okay, third clock, Shanghai, 12:03.

625
00:39:08,276 --> 00:39:10,276
That's three steps forward.

626
00:39:12,689 --> 00:39:13,648
One.

627
00:39:44,808 --> 00:39:45,641
Two.

628
00:39:49,026 --> 00:39:50,484
Shit!

629
00:39:51,173 --> 00:39:54,213
Hey! Something opened over there.
Look, right there!

630
00:39:55,963 --> 00:39:59,047
It's a combination lock.
We need three more numbers.

631
00:39:59,254 --> 00:40:00,713
Three numbers. Okay.

632
00:40:00,891 --> 00:40:03,016
Hey, something's happening here.

633
00:40:03,905 --> 00:40:07,946
"Money makes the world turn.
Don't let it stop or else it all ends."

634
00:40:08,297 --> 00:40:09,714
The hell does that mean?

635
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,417
Shit. What number?

636
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:14,709
The codes in here?

637
00:40:16,352 --> 00:40:17,436
Come on! What is it?

638
00:40:17,557 --> 00:40:21,432
There's international accounts on here.
Tokyo and South Africa. Maybe that's it?

639
00:40:21,468 --> 00:40:24,635
Every piece of paper in here
has goddamn numbers on it!

640
00:40:25,645 --> 00:40:27,532
- Full laser-grid activation...
- Oh, shit.

641
00:40:27,568 --> 00:40:29,370
...in three minutes.

642
00:40:30,716 --> 00:40:32,183
We're not gonna make it.

643
00:40:32,282 --> 00:40:36,308
Guys, we're not gonna make it in time!
What else is there? Look!

644
00:40:36,437 --> 00:40:38,895
Don't panic.
We just need to keep looking, okay?

645
00:40:38,931 --> 00:40:40,098
Calm down, okay?

646
00:40:42,844 --> 00:40:43,844
Okay.

647
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:44,916
Nate!

648
00:40:45,874 --> 00:40:47,832
What is he doing? No, no, no.

649
00:40:47,882 --> 00:40:50,799
- Nate! What are you doing?
- Stop!

650
00:40:50,835 --> 00:40:54,374
- No. Wait. Wait. Oh, shit!
- Nate! No, no, no.

651
00:40:54,409 --> 00:40:56,659
- Wait! What the hell? Stop it!
- Nate!

652
00:40:56,947 --> 00:40:58,799
Just stay there. Stay there.

653
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:02,535
We don't know if those tiles are safe
because we haven't found any clues.

654
00:41:02,617 --> 00:41:04,907
So just stop what you're doing!

655
00:41:05,427 --> 00:41:07,468
- Nate!
- No! Stop!

656
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:10,399
- Stop! Stop!
- Stop, please!

657
00:41:10,475 --> 00:41:12,766
You're gonna get us killed! Please stop.

658
00:41:12,802 --> 00:41:15,718
Whatever you think you're doing,
it's not helping us.

659
00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:17,069
It's okay. It's working.

660
00:41:17,136 --> 00:41:19,677
Stop for two seconds, okay? We just... No!

661
00:41:23,427 --> 00:41:24,760
He's gonna kill us.

662
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:27,619
This is why he spared me.
I know you're afraid.

663
00:41:27,655 --> 00:41:30,405
- Stop!
- I know... I know you're afraid.

664
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,475
Don't be afraid.

665
00:41:31,526 --> 00:41:34,484
- I'm not scared! Listen to her!
- You're gonna kill us!

666
00:41:35,103 --> 00:41:37,020
You don't need to do this, okay?

667
00:41:41,576 --> 00:41:42,868
Zoey! Zoey!

668
00:41:45,494 --> 00:41:47,536
Get him up! Come on! Hurry!

669
00:41:47,697 --> 00:41:49,274
Nothing happened when he hit his head.

670
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,562
Maybe it's just the end of the counters
that are booby-trapped.

671
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:53,659
Let's get him off the tiles.

672
00:41:53,946 --> 00:41:56,236
Let's go. Help me pull him up.

673
00:41:59,127 --> 00:42:00,252
Careful. Careful!

674
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:06,956
That was close.

675
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:09,672
- Is he okay?
- He's out cold.

676
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,867
- We're gonna have to carry him.
- Father Nutbag torched all the clues!

677
00:42:12,968 --> 00:42:14,630
The papers weren't the answer.
There was too many of them.

678
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:15,678
What's the clue again?

679
00:42:15,714 --> 00:42:18,673
"Money makes the world turn.
Never let it stop..."

680
00:42:18,818 --> 00:42:21,068
Wait. We gotta turn something.

681
00:42:23,945 --> 00:42:26,278
- It's stuck!
- Try turning it both ways!

682
00:42:26,314 --> 00:42:28,125
We were never looking for a number.

683
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:30,434
"Don't let it stop."
Don't let it stop turning.

684
00:42:30,554 --> 00:42:32,413
- Oh, shit.
- Got it. I got it.

685
00:42:32,503 --> 00:42:33,835
We got something.

686
00:42:34,342 --> 00:42:37,091
It's a graph, a transparency.
You gotta put it on something.

687
00:42:37,127 --> 00:42:38,918
Maybe it goes on the map. Throw it here.

688
00:42:39,008 --> 00:42:40,738
Full laser-grid activation

689
00:42:40,821 --> 00:42:42,410
- in one minute.
- We're running out of time!

690
00:42:42,446 --> 00:42:43,265
Toss it over!

691
00:42:43,301 --> 00:42:46,381
- I'll throw it over the laser tiles.
- You have to throw it.

692
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:49,745
- Throw it over! Hurry! Come on!
- Go! You got it!

693
00:42:53,054 --> 00:42:55,053
Okay. Okay, okay.

694
00:42:55,154 --> 00:42:57,552
All right. You go and I'll guide you out.

695
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:58,800
I'm not leaving without you.

696
00:42:58,836 --> 00:43:01,781
- We need help to carry the chosen one!
- Just go.

697
00:43:01,844 --> 00:43:04,219
- Hurry up! We gotta get out of here.
- Shit.

698
00:43:07,827 --> 00:43:09,213
- I got the lollipops.
- Here.

699
00:43:09,249 --> 00:43:11,666
I got him, I got him. Careful, careful.

700
00:43:14,152 --> 00:43:17,718
- We sure we need this asshole?
- Take two tiles to the left.

701
00:43:18,003 --> 00:43:19,253
One, two.

702
00:43:19,594 --> 00:43:20,832
We're leaving you a path.

703
00:43:20,868 --> 00:43:23,023
Okay. Six tiles straight.

704
00:43:24,774 --> 00:43:26,649
Two tiles diagonally to the right.

705
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:29,107
One, two.

706
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:31,899
- Two tiles diagonally to the left.
- Full laser-grid activation...

707
00:43:31,983 --> 00:43:34,003
- One, two.
- ...in ten, nine,

708
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,594
- eight, seven, six, five...
- And then straight all the way up.

709
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:41,114
...four, three, two, one.

710
00:43:57,726 --> 00:43:58,560
Shit.

711
00:44:10,566 --> 00:44:12,983
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up! Come on.

712
00:44:13,542 --> 00:44:14,150
What happened?

713
00:44:14,186 --> 00:44:16,603
We almost lost Zoey out there,
that's what happened.

714
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:19,847
- You like being stupid and selfish?
- Okay, I'm sorry.

715
00:44:19,883 --> 00:44:21,826
- I'm sorry.
- Is that what you like, huh?

716
00:44:21,931 --> 00:44:23,366
Ben, Ben, Ben! Stop!

717
00:44:24,058 --> 00:44:26,599
Okay, enough! He was just trying to help!

718
00:44:30,078 --> 00:44:31,078
Thank you.

719
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:34,050
For getting us out of there.

720
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:36,636
Yeah, don't worry about it.

721
00:44:41,537 --> 00:44:42,705
What's happening?

722
00:44:42,866 --> 00:44:44,075
It's gonna collapse!

723
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:46,620
Everybody run! Run!

724
00:44:47,657 --> 00:44:48,524
- Go!
- Run!

725
00:44:48,596 --> 00:44:50,554
Hurry up! Get out of here!

726
00:44:50,638 --> 00:44:52,389
- Go, go, go!
- Hurry up!

727
00:45:04,388 --> 00:45:05,805
Well, that's impressive.

728
00:45:15,155 --> 00:45:16,489
A full 360.

729
00:45:16,628 --> 00:45:19,420
- They did something like this in our game.
- Ours too.

730
00:45:20,052 --> 00:45:22,135
This is some next-level shit.

731
00:45:23,905 --> 00:45:25,947
Hundred bucks says they try to drown us.

732
00:45:26,038 --> 00:45:28,098
No, are you kidding?
Look at all this sand.

733
00:45:28,214 --> 00:45:29,757
Definitely land mines.

734
00:45:34,117 --> 00:45:37,159
Check this out. It's a Polaroid camera
and it says something.

735
00:45:38,286 --> 00:45:40,295
- What does that say?
- "It will last longer."

736
00:45:40,401 --> 00:45:41,652
It's like the phrase.

737
00:45:42,462 --> 00:45:44,128
I guess you have to take a picture.

738
00:45:55,292 --> 00:45:58,085
What...? What the hell was
the point of that?

739
00:45:58,674 --> 00:46:02,090
- It looks like a postcard, right?
- Yeah, like a memory.

740
00:46:02,873 --> 00:46:04,507
There's writing on the back.

741
00:46:04,581 --> 00:46:06,457
It says, "Drop your anchor
at Hourglass Bay."

742
00:46:06,558 --> 00:46:08,641
That's the name
on the billboard behind us.

743
00:46:10,471 --> 00:46:11,533
It's just the room.

744
00:46:11,595 --> 00:46:13,540
Yeah, but, no, look at the horizon.

745
00:46:13,714 --> 00:46:15,631
There's a tiny boat
that's not on the wall.

746
00:46:16,664 --> 00:46:20,039
So we're looking for something nautical.
Maybe an anchor?

747
00:46:20,091 --> 00:46:23,008
- Possibly surrounded by land mines.
- Would you stop saying that?

748
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,655
Can we just be careful
what we're stepping on?

749
00:46:25,802 --> 00:46:29,593
- I'm gonna check by the pier.
- The exit has to be in this shack.

750
00:46:29,629 --> 00:46:32,422
X marks the spot? I don't know.

751
00:46:33,567 --> 00:46:35,317
I'll bet that fridge is our way out.

752
00:46:41,274 --> 00:46:42,881
You still think the rooms are connected?

753
00:46:42,917 --> 00:46:45,999
The beach bag on the train,
Sonya's name in the bank,

754
00:46:46,087 --> 00:46:48,087
even the walls changing
like they just did,

755
00:46:48,123 --> 00:46:51,894
it feels like it's all connected,
like it's telling a story.

756
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:54,679
I don't know.
It just doesn't feel like it's about us.

757
00:46:56,472 --> 00:46:58,137
SOS! Our ship is sinking!

758
00:46:58,173 --> 00:47:01,798
- I've got a weird distress call here.
- I got a ship in a bottle.

759
00:47:01,874 --> 00:47:04,214
Ship in a bottle.
I'm gonna check this cooler.

760
00:47:04,304 --> 00:47:06,512
Let's see what's behind door number...

761
00:47:12,445 --> 00:47:15,362
Zoey. Now we know what that anchor's for.

762
00:47:15,686 --> 00:47:18,128
There's a telescope
at the top of the lighthouse.

763
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:19,657
I think I found our boat.

764
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,440
"Blind Love"? Like the Bon Jovi song?

765
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:27,768
Guys, Ben figured it out.

766
00:47:27,867 --> 00:47:29,700
Minos is Bon Jovi.

767
00:47:31,688 --> 00:47:32,522
Very funny.

768
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,783
Let's find an anchor.

769
00:47:34,984 --> 00:47:36,025
Careful, guys.

770
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:38,279
Seriously, how did we miss this?

771
00:47:40,644 --> 00:47:43,145
- I don't see anything down here.
- It's just netting.

772
00:47:44,181 --> 00:47:45,389
Nothing here.

773
00:47:48,837 --> 00:47:49,794
What the...?

774
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:53,426
- This has to connect to something.
- Wait, look.

775
00:47:56,011 --> 00:47:57,386
It's a metal detector.

776
00:48:00,313 --> 00:48:01,146
Does it work?

777
00:48:02,132 --> 00:48:02,967
Yeah.

778
00:48:04,275 --> 00:48:05,983
- Why is it still in my face?
- Let me try.

779
00:48:06,052 --> 00:48:08,718
- Sorry. Here.
- Let me see it. Thank you.

780
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,658
My dad found a silver dollar
with one of those once.

781
00:48:11,769 --> 00:48:13,186
It was worth a dollar.

782
00:48:15,465 --> 00:48:16,633
There's nothing here.

783
00:48:16,834 --> 00:48:19,291
What is with these people
and these crazy-ass mannequins?

784
00:48:26,184 --> 00:48:27,435
It's gonna be under the sand.

785
00:48:38,677 --> 00:48:40,635
- Did you hear that?
- Oh, yeah.

786
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,710
There's something.

787
00:48:43,749 --> 00:48:46,831
- You still thinking land mines?
- Nice and easy.

788
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:52,853
- Here.
- Yeah.

789
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,336
- Zoey, can you bring some shovels?
- Yeah.

790
00:48:55,441 --> 00:48:56,775
We found something.

791
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:04,110
I feel something.

792
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:05,350
Lose the shovels.

793
00:49:07,503 --> 00:49:08,337
Come on.

794
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,746
- The anchor!
- It's the anchor.

795
00:49:13,703 --> 00:49:15,411
- You got it?
- Let's get it to the door.

796
00:49:18,175 --> 00:49:20,509
- Oh, shit. That's not good.
- It's tied down.

797
00:49:20,647 --> 00:49:22,189
- It's stuck.
- Pull!

798
00:49:22,675 --> 00:49:24,508
- All together.
- Help me grab it.

799
00:49:24,968 --> 00:49:26,136
Go!

800
00:49:27,302 --> 00:49:29,135
Pull! Keep going!

801
00:49:30,376 --> 00:49:32,043
It's connected to something.

802
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,987
- What happened?
- Something's happening.

803
00:49:35,023 --> 00:49:37,273
Hear that?
There's something under the sand.

804
00:49:37,468 --> 00:49:39,176
- Guys?
- What the hell is that?

805
00:49:41,707 --> 00:49:42,926
Where'd it go?

806
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:44,635
- This can't be good.
- The anchor!

807
00:49:47,822 --> 00:49:48,823
Give me your hand!

808
00:49:48,999 --> 00:49:51,499
- Hey! Get me out!
- Grab him! Grab him!

809
00:49:56,291 --> 00:49:59,249
- We're sinking! It's pulling me down!
- Get out!

810
00:49:59,724 --> 00:50:01,140
Grab my arm! Grab!

811
00:50:01,234 --> 00:50:04,401
- It's got my legs!
- We can't get any closer!

812
00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:07,117
- Reach! Hurry!
- Help me!

813
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:08,321
Grab his hand!

814
00:50:09,564 --> 00:50:10,440
Come on!

815
00:50:10,523 --> 00:50:12,231
- Come on, stop it!
- Rachel!

816
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:15,116
We need something!
We need something to get her.

817
00:50:15,251 --> 00:50:17,292
- Stop moving!
- I'm gonna get the ring.

818
00:50:18,772 --> 00:50:19,813
Come on!

819
00:50:21,138 --> 00:50:21,970
Rachel!

820
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:24,757
- No!
- Rachel!

821
00:50:25,213 --> 00:50:26,089
Shit!

822
00:50:29,082 --> 00:50:31,332
- Give me the rope.
- You're not going down there.

823
00:50:31,603 --> 00:50:33,562
What are you doing? She's gone.

824
00:50:33,598 --> 00:50:36,016
- Listen!
- Hold this, okay? Hold this.

825
00:50:36,052 --> 00:50:39,345
- You're not going!
- Listen! I have to do this, okay?

826
00:50:39,447 --> 00:50:41,447
Nate, you're crazy. Stop! Stop!

827
00:50:41,483 --> 00:50:43,650
Hold him! Hold on!

828
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,965
Just hold it tight!

829
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,234
Rachel! Rachel, you okay?

830
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:54,687
Come out of there. You can do it!

831
00:50:55,444 --> 00:50:58,026
- Rachel! Rachel! Grab the rope!
- Come on!

832
00:50:58,368 --> 00:51:00,995
- You can do it!
- Get up. Hold it!

833
00:51:01,835 --> 00:51:03,585
Come on! Get it!

834
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:07,438
Okay. All right.

835
00:51:07,769 --> 00:51:08,851
Come on, Nate!

836
00:51:09,069 --> 00:51:10,444
Nate!

837
00:51:10,529 --> 00:51:14,070
Nate! Come on! Go up the rope!
Come on! Nate!

838
00:51:14,175 --> 00:51:16,300
Come on! Go up the rope! Come on!

839
00:51:16,705 --> 00:51:17,537
No!

840
00:51:18,697 --> 00:51:20,280
We have to help him! We have to!

841
00:51:20,316 --> 00:51:22,627
- The rope's gone!
- He saved me. We have to save him!

842
00:51:22,693 --> 00:51:23,561
Bring the anchor!

843
00:51:23,597 --> 00:51:25,514
- Rachel!
- We can't help him.

844
00:51:26,477 --> 00:51:28,604
Hurry up! They're gonna sink this too.

845
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,145
Hurry, it's going under us.

846
00:51:31,929 --> 00:51:33,596
- Come on, come on!
- Okay.

847
00:51:34,108 --> 00:51:35,900
Rachel, come on, let's go!

848
00:51:36,567 --> 00:51:38,195
Rachel, come on. He's gone!

849
00:51:38,231 --> 00:51:40,897
There's nothing we can do!
We gotta get out of here!

850
00:51:43,179 --> 00:51:44,513
"Bon voyage."

851
00:51:48,315 --> 00:51:50,314
Guys, I think this is our exit.

852
00:51:51,771 --> 00:51:54,103
The fridge is unplugged.
I found the power cord.

853
00:51:54,139 --> 00:51:57,639
Maybe if we find the other end,
we plug it in, open it, and get out.

854
00:51:57,675 --> 00:51:58,552
Yeah. Okay.

855
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:06,894
The light switch, it looks like
the lighthouse in the postcard.

856
00:52:06,978 --> 00:52:08,686
There has to be a connection.

857
00:52:10,637 --> 00:52:11,637
Worth a try.

858
00:52:12,025 --> 00:52:14,251
'Cause nothing bad happens
when we touch things.

859
00:52:14,287 --> 00:52:16,162
Do it! We have to move.

860
00:52:16,635 --> 00:52:17,594
Oh, shit!

861
00:52:17,695 --> 00:52:18,528
Hold on.

862
00:52:22,636 --> 00:52:24,928
If we don't find the exit,
this whole thing's going down.

863
00:52:31,633 --> 00:52:34,925
Look! Look at the lighthouse.
It has a ladder on it now.

864
00:52:36,081 --> 00:52:38,373
- I'm gonna go check it out.
- I'm coming with you.

865
00:52:38,776 --> 00:52:39,777
Shit!

866
00:52:40,116 --> 00:52:42,510
- Help them, in case I'm wrong.
- Okay.

867
00:52:42,546 --> 00:52:43,963
The wood is blocking the exit.

868
00:52:43,999 --> 00:52:45,749
- Shit! Get it out!
- Clear a path!

869
00:52:51,837 --> 00:52:52,670
Careful.

870
00:52:57,164 --> 00:52:58,539
Clear a path!

871
00:53:06,464 --> 00:53:08,131
The light, it stopped!

872
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,088
"I can't sea you."

873
00:53:10,351 --> 00:53:11,882
The door's clear. Did you find anything?

874
00:53:11,918 --> 00:53:15,250
Yeah, there's a message on the sign
and it says, "I can't sea you."

875
00:53:15,286 --> 00:53:17,161
But "sea" is spelled S-E-A.

876
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,479
- I don't know.
- Come on down. We'll figure it out.

877
00:53:20,836 --> 00:53:23,795
The clue is "I can't sea you,"
spelled S-E-A.

878
00:53:23,831 --> 00:53:24,664
S-E-A?

879
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:25,701
- S-E-A!
- Okay.

880
00:53:25,737 --> 00:53:27,695
I'm gonna go check the boat!

881
00:53:31,768 --> 00:53:33,144
What the...?

882
00:53:35,688 --> 00:53:36,605
No! No!

883
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:39,289
"I can't sea you"?

884
00:53:39,325 --> 00:53:42,534
- I don't know.
- Sea salt shakers? I don't know!

885
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:46,902
Okay. Let's see.
"I can't... I can't sea you."

886
00:53:52,595 --> 00:53:54,096
Come on! "I can't sea you."

887
00:53:56,009 --> 00:53:58,467
- Maybe it has something to do with eyes!
- What?

888
00:53:58,636 --> 00:54:02,427
Not somebody's eyeballs. You can't open
a fridge with somebody's eyeballs.

889
00:54:09,949 --> 00:54:11,158
Shit!

890
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:22,501
"Blind love" and "I can't sea you." Wait.

891
00:54:24,296 --> 00:54:25,545
The mannequin.

892
00:54:26,649 --> 00:54:28,316
Yeah, the mannequin!

893
00:54:31,404 --> 00:54:32,237
Shit!

894
00:54:33,177 --> 00:54:34,094
Come on.

895
00:54:34,668 --> 00:54:35,500
Come on.

896
00:54:38,832 --> 00:54:40,665
Shit, yeah! I got it!

897
00:54:43,617 --> 00:54:44,450
Shit.

898
00:54:45,272 --> 00:54:46,824
Zoey, I've got the plug!

899
00:54:46,913 --> 00:54:49,239
No, Ben, I think this is another way out!

900
00:54:49,275 --> 00:54:50,817
Here! Take it! Take it!

901
00:54:58,126 --> 00:55:00,084
It worked! Ben, go get Zoey.

902
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:04,089
- Zoey, we got the door open! Come on!
- I found a way out.

903
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:06,636
This could be a way out of the game!

904
00:55:06,672 --> 00:55:09,080
Wait, wait! Zoey found another way out.

905
00:55:09,116 --> 00:55:11,084
What are you talking about,
she found another way?

906
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:14,536
- This is the way out! Come on!
- What the hell is she doing?

907
00:55:14,731 --> 00:55:17,663
- They're not listening to me!
- We have to go! We don't have time!

908
00:55:17,699 --> 00:55:20,531
The whole room's collapsing!
Come on, it's the way out!

909
00:55:20,653 --> 00:55:23,194
If we keep playing,
how many of us die before this is over?

910
00:55:23,295 --> 00:55:26,457
We don't know where that's gonna lead.
We have to go here! This is the way out!

911
00:55:26,569 --> 00:55:29,440
Even if you win, what makes you think
they'll let you walk away free?

912
00:55:29,476 --> 00:55:30,891
Rachel. Come on.

913
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:34,218
You have to trust her.
She saved my life! Hurry, let's go!

914
00:55:35,097 --> 00:55:36,890
- Yeah. Okay.
- Wait... Rachel!

915
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:38,355
- Yeah. Go, go, go!
- Ben!

916
00:55:38,443 --> 00:55:40,156
You cannot cheat the game!

917
00:55:40,262 --> 00:55:43,828
Brianna, come on! Shit.
Come on! We don't have time!

918
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:45,217
- Hurry, Rachel!
- I'm coming!

919
00:55:45,957 --> 00:55:46,958
Brianna, come on!

920
00:55:50,044 --> 00:55:51,502
- Oh, my God.
- Come on!

921
00:55:53,104 --> 00:55:55,270
What are you waiting for? Hurry up!

922
00:55:55,758 --> 00:55:57,217
- Come on.
- I'm coming!

923
00:55:57,301 --> 00:55:58,344
- Come on.
- I'm coming!

924
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,297
Brianna, let's go! Come on!

925
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:04,114
Come on, hurry!

926
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:06,191
- Brianna, come on!
- Shit. Shit.

927
00:56:08,654 --> 00:56:09,821
Brianna, let's go!

928
00:56:10,977 --> 00:56:13,227
Hurry! We're sinking!

929
00:56:18,855 --> 00:56:20,146
- Okay.
- Hurry up.

930
00:56:20,213 --> 00:56:23,464
Come on. Okay, okay.
You go in first. Yeah, I got it.

931
00:56:31,349 --> 00:56:32,475
Shit.

932
00:56:35,539 --> 00:56:36,664
Hurry!

933
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:37,866
Climb, Ben. Climb.

934
00:56:37,942 --> 00:56:39,150
Let's go! Come on!

935
00:56:42,219 --> 00:56:43,260
Ben!

936
00:56:44,223 --> 00:56:45,056
Ben!

937
00:56:50,684 --> 00:56:51,851
Let's go, come on!

938
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:54,318
- I'm not gonna make it!
- You got it.

939
00:56:54,393 --> 00:56:55,893
Just make it out alive!

940
00:56:55,992 --> 00:56:57,410
- Come on!
- Come on.

941
00:56:58,311 --> 00:56:59,812
Ben! No!

942
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:01,036
Ben!

943
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,912
No, no, no!

944
00:57:05,966 --> 00:57:07,382
We have to go now!

945
00:57:08,903 --> 00:57:10,027
Zoey!

946
00:57:10,481 --> 00:57:11,815
No, no, no!

947
00:57:12,661 --> 00:57:16,620
I tend to have this weird loyalty thing
for people who save my life.

948
00:57:19,692 --> 00:57:23,108
Zoey, come on.
You have to leave him. Come on.

949
00:57:23,144 --> 00:57:24,326
Zoey, it's sinking!

950
00:57:24,386 --> 00:57:27,886
Don't do this, Zoey!
Come on. Give me your hand!

951
00:57:27,955 --> 00:57:29,747
Come on, give me your hand!

952
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:01,139
It's safe. Come on.

953
00:58:07,047 --> 00:58:09,630
I should've just gone the way
he wanted me to.

954
00:58:09,981 --> 00:58:11,731
Ben would still be alive.

955
00:58:14,306 --> 00:58:15,472
I lost him.

956
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:18,167
He was my best friend.

957
00:58:18,846 --> 00:58:20,304
He died because of me.

958
00:58:21,713 --> 00:58:25,796
I lost him. He didn't even wanna...
He didn't wanna come back.

959
00:58:27,709 --> 00:58:30,249
It's my fault. It's my fault.

960
00:58:30,333 --> 00:58:31,792
Zoey, don't do this.

961
00:58:34,207 --> 00:58:35,500
It's Minos's fault.

962
00:58:36,499 --> 00:58:37,666
They did this.

963
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:41,166
- No, I chose to come back into the game.
- I didn't.

964
00:58:42,026 --> 00:58:45,318
I mean, Brianna didn't. Nate didn't.

965
00:58:45,542 --> 00:58:49,500
They would have found you and Ben
one way or another. You know that.

966
00:58:50,603 --> 00:58:51,811
And you were right.

967
00:58:51,879 --> 00:58:54,326
They're never going to stop
unless we stop them.

968
00:58:54,459 --> 00:58:57,791
You still have your phone, right?
With the video from the train.

969
00:58:58,163 --> 00:59:01,288
What does it matter?
It doesn't prove anything.

970
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:03,281
It's more than we had before.

971
00:59:04,028 --> 00:59:04,860
Right?

972
00:59:06,507 --> 00:59:07,340
Look.

973
00:59:08,618 --> 00:59:11,910
Everyone went through hell in their games.

974
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:15,662
I was born with a microdeletion
in one of my genes.

975
00:59:16,663 --> 00:59:20,120
It affects sensation.
I can't feel physical pain.

976
00:59:22,519 --> 00:59:23,895
Just imagine...

977
00:59:24,566 --> 00:59:28,441
the kinds of puzzles
Minos came up with for the pain freaks.

978
00:59:29,545 --> 00:59:30,588
You're fighting back.

979
00:59:31,577 --> 00:59:32,828
You're doing the right thing.

980
00:59:36,158 --> 00:59:38,034
We have to go. Come on.

981
00:59:44,369 --> 00:59:45,786
Rach, do...?

982
00:59:49,072 --> 00:59:49,907
You hear that?

983
00:59:52,377 --> 00:59:54,377
Hey, there's something over there.

984
01:00:02,402 --> 01:00:03,320
Oh, my God.

985
01:00:20,673 --> 01:00:21,673
We made it.

986
01:00:27,146 --> 01:00:29,562
We're out. Come on. Come on.

987
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:31,142
We're out.

988
01:00:32,442 --> 01:00:34,317
Oh, my God. We're out.

989
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:39,392
Wait! Don't let it close!

990
01:00:44,790 --> 01:00:46,082
I don't understand.

991
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:47,495
What's going on?

992
01:00:48,286 --> 01:00:49,828
We're still in the game.

993
01:00:50,923 --> 01:00:52,464
Oh, no, no, no.

994
01:00:56,307 --> 01:00:59,391
Oh, my God. What did they do to you?

995
01:01:01,507 --> 01:01:04,340
It's acid. When the timer runs out,
it rains acid.

996
01:01:04,424 --> 01:01:05,592
Acid? What?

997
01:01:05,675 --> 01:01:08,300
We have to hurry.
We have to find the keys to the bodega.

998
01:01:08,382 --> 01:01:11,091
If we could just get through this lock,
I think it's the way out.

999
01:01:12,215 --> 01:01:13,050
May 26th.

1000
01:01:13,133 --> 01:01:17,592
- It's 0-5-2-6 again, but we need a key.
- No, but she's holding a key.

1001
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:20,841
- Yeah, but how does that help us?
- We have a minute left.

1002
01:01:20,924 --> 01:01:24,092
"I'll always be watching over you"
and she's an angel, right?

1003
01:01:24,174 --> 01:01:28,290
Wait! There's a cloud above her,
so we climb it, right? We climb it!

1004
01:01:28,385 --> 01:01:31,844
- There's a ladder on the fire escape!
- Okay. I'll climb it.

1005
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:40,302
Bri, do you see anything?

1006
01:01:40,338 --> 01:01:42,964
Why are there so many plants?
So many plants.

1007
01:01:44,228 --> 01:01:45,354
Come on, come on.

1008
01:01:47,114 --> 01:01:50,532
- I found a key! It's stuck to the railing.
- Hurry!

1009
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:52,597
We only have 30 seconds left!

1010
01:01:52,703 --> 01:01:55,369
- Come on, Brianna. You can do it!
- I got it!

1011
01:01:55,405 --> 01:01:57,987
- Here, catch!
- Got it!

1012
01:01:58,296 --> 01:01:59,587
Okay, try it. Go, go, go.

1013
01:01:59,733 --> 01:02:02,234
Hurry! Get down here!
It's about to rain again!

1014
01:02:03,073 --> 01:02:04,030
Okay.

1015
01:02:05,202 --> 01:02:06,368
Okay.

1016
01:02:06,493 --> 01:02:07,325
Lift!

1017
01:02:09,542 --> 01:02:11,167
Hurry up! Lift the gate!

1018
01:02:11,579 --> 01:02:13,537
It's another locked door.

1019
01:02:37,528 --> 01:02:39,861
The rain stopped. They reset the timer.

1020
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:50,964
Conservation activists have started
a chain reaction throughout the city.

1021
01:02:51,046 --> 01:02:52,831
With rising water costs,

1022
01:02:52,898 --> 01:02:56,565
residents are turning
to urban rainwater collection.

1023
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:57,750
Water collection.

1024
01:02:59,214 --> 01:03:02,257
- They want us to collect the rain.
- Conservation activists...

1025
01:03:02,293 --> 01:03:03,627
Another awning came down.

1026
01:03:03,688 --> 01:03:05,936
...have started a chain reaction
throughout the city.

1027
01:03:06,067 --> 01:03:08,859
Okay, chain reaction.
There's a chain on the phone booth.

1028
01:03:13,032 --> 01:03:14,283
All right. Okay.

1029
01:03:16,818 --> 01:03:19,568
All right. They want us
to answer the phone.

1030
01:03:19,604 --> 01:03:22,299
If we collect the rain,
we can use the acid to burn through.

1031
01:03:22,335 --> 01:03:24,334
- That could work.
- How do we contain acid?

1032
01:03:25,221 --> 01:03:27,023
- Wait, don't touch that!
- No, it's fine.

1033
01:03:27,097 --> 01:03:29,388
- You'll burn your hands.
- I'm fine. I don't feel it.

1034
01:03:29,502 --> 01:03:32,209
Hydrochloric acid burns
through everything but a certain plastic.

1035
01:03:32,245 --> 01:03:33,869
Look for anything that hasn't melted.

1036
01:03:36,419 --> 01:03:38,918
Everything's melted, even the awnings.

1037
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,958
We only have 20 seconds.

1038
01:03:42,792 --> 01:03:43,668
Shit.

1039
01:03:45,949 --> 01:03:48,658
There's a ketchup bottle here.
There's a bottle hasn't melted.

1040
01:03:49,439 --> 01:03:50,564
Okay.

1041
01:03:53,239 --> 01:03:56,363
PMP. Polymethylpentene. Yes, this is it!

1042
01:03:56,517 --> 01:03:57,809
Acid won't melt this.

1043
01:03:58,112 --> 01:04:00,104
We don't have much time! Let's go!

1044
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:02,877
- Hurry! Get under the awning!
- All right, hurry!

1045
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,616
It worked! It worked.

1046
01:04:32,907 --> 01:04:33,907
Okay.

1047
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:39,075
It's working! It's working.

1048
01:04:43,324 --> 01:04:45,491
Go, go, go! Answer it!

1049
01:04:45,574 --> 01:04:47,324
- Go!
- Hello?

1050
01:04:48,165 --> 01:04:50,291
Here, let me try it. Hello?

1051
01:04:50,491 --> 01:04:51,949
There's nobody there.

1052
01:04:52,363 --> 01:04:54,739
Okay. "When the weather turns,
give us a call."

1053
01:04:54,908 --> 01:04:56,730
It must have something to do with the cab.

1054
01:04:56,766 --> 01:04:57,599
It's not working.

1055
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,085
- What are you doing?
- Stay in there.

1056
01:05:02,121 --> 01:05:03,996
There's not enough room for all of us!

1057
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:05,983
- Come on, let's try.
- We're missing something!

1058
01:05:06,044 --> 01:05:08,794
- I don't know!
- You can't stay out there!

1059
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:11,549
- It's not like we really have a choice!
- No, wait.

1060
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:15,345
- We can't do it like this. We can fit.
- Zoey, catch! Use it.

1061
01:05:24,247 --> 01:05:26,498
Zoey! Zoey!

1062
01:05:27,314 --> 01:05:28,773
Is she okay?

1063
01:05:29,005 --> 01:05:31,462
"Pawnshop." Pawnshop!

1064
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:36,042
"Three rings." Pick up the phone
and put it back down!

1065
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:36,931
What?

1066
01:05:37,013 --> 01:05:39,220
Pick up the phone and put it back down!

1067
01:05:40,522 --> 01:05:42,480
Now pick it up on the third ring!

1068
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:44,561
Third ring? Okay. One.

1069
01:05:50,699 --> 01:05:51,699
Hello?

1070
01:05:52,422 --> 01:05:54,505
Do you see the cab?
The door, the door, the door!

1071
01:05:58,792 --> 01:06:00,667
- Okay. Ready? Go!
- Let's go!

1072
01:06:02,023 --> 01:06:03,523
- Go!
- Come on!

1073
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,326
- It won't open. They locked it.
- Open the door!

1074
01:06:08,396 --> 01:06:09,979
- Get back to the booth!
- Zoey!

1075
01:06:10,725 --> 01:06:13,779
- Try the front door.
- The booth! They're cutting us off!

1076
01:06:16,779 --> 01:06:18,695
Zoey, it's locked! I can't get it open!

1077
01:06:22,815 --> 01:06:24,190
- It won't open.
- They're locked!

1078
01:06:24,267 --> 01:06:26,724
- It won't open.
- Try the front! Try the front.

1079
01:06:26,823 --> 01:06:27,866
I... I can't!

1080
01:06:27,965 --> 01:06:30,382
- No, no, no!
- There's nowhere to go.

1081
01:06:32,942 --> 01:06:34,442
Brianna, listen to me.

1082
01:06:34,525 --> 01:06:37,150
Don't give them the satisfaction, okay?

1083
01:06:37,233 --> 01:06:39,337
Hey! Hey, don't give up!

1084
01:06:39,476 --> 01:06:41,227
I don't wanna die.

1085
01:06:41,483 --> 01:06:42,484
I know.

1086
01:06:44,768 --> 01:06:45,811
Come on!

1087
01:06:50,584 --> 01:06:52,042
Come on! Come on!

1088
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:34,351
"Sonya."

1089
01:07:35,428 --> 01:07:37,303
These rooms are your story.

1090
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:52,367
But who are you?

1091
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:12,416
"Today was the best day with Mommy.
We rode a train to the city.

1092
01:08:13,035 --> 01:08:15,120
I got a lolly at the bank.
We went to the beach.

1093
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:18,578
Mommy told me
that when someone you love becomes...

1094
01:08:19,752 --> 01:08:20,710
a memory..."

1095
01:08:21,668 --> 01:08:23,877
...that memory becomes a treasure.

1096
01:08:33,049 --> 01:08:34,382
Oh, my God. Amanda!

1097
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:36,342
Amanda.

1098
01:08:37,517 --> 01:08:38,391
Zoey.

1099
01:08:38,458 --> 01:08:41,000
I don't understand.
I thought you were dead.

1100
01:08:41,076 --> 01:08:42,493
I watched you die.

1101
01:08:43,503 --> 01:08:45,254
No, you watched me fall.

1102
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,907
If you didn't see it, it didn't happen.

1103
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,131
No, no, no!

1104
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:53,842
- Just hold on!
- It's okay.

1105
01:08:57,672 --> 01:09:00,714
They broke me and I helped them.

1106
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:03,784
Why? Why would you help them?

1107
01:09:03,867 --> 01:09:07,670
Sonya's my daughter.
They kidnapped her, so I would help them.

1108
01:09:07,773 --> 01:09:09,481
You built this game?

1109
01:09:09,517 --> 01:09:12,601
I didn't have a choice.
And you won't have a choice either.

1110
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:15,947
Who better to design a game
than someone who beat them?

1111
01:09:16,742 --> 01:09:19,268
I would never help them design a game.

1112
01:09:19,358 --> 01:09:20,513
Are you crazy?

1113
01:09:20,609 --> 01:09:21,733
No, no, Zoey.

1114
01:09:21,903 --> 01:09:24,694
It's not a negotiation.
They already have your body.

1115
01:09:24,769 --> 01:09:27,894
They want your mind and they'll kill
everything you love till they get it.

1116
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:29,846
They have everything else!

1117
01:09:30,292 --> 01:09:31,293
No, not yet.

1118
01:09:32,264 --> 01:09:34,055
What are you talking about?

1119
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:35,710
If you didn't see it,

1120
01:09:36,485 --> 01:09:38,361
it didn't happen.

1121
01:09:39,173 --> 01:09:40,047
Hello?

1122
01:09:43,124 --> 01:09:44,415
Ben?

1123
01:09:44,499 --> 01:09:46,753
- Zoey!
- Oh, my God, Ben! You're alive!

1124
01:09:46,832 --> 01:09:48,749
Ben! Ben!

1125
01:09:49,004 --> 01:09:50,463
Is that Amanda?

1126
01:09:52,257 --> 01:09:54,188
Zoey, what's happening?

1127
01:09:54,267 --> 01:09:57,281
Zoey, how is she alive?
We watched her die!

1128
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,486
- What are you gonna do to him?
- Not me, them.

1129
01:09:59,578 --> 01:10:03,327
But they won't hurt him
as long as you design their next game.

1130
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:14,849
They want you
to be their next Puzzle Maker.

1131
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,128
What is that?

1132
01:10:23,835 --> 01:10:25,252
Just say yes.

1133
01:10:25,288 --> 01:10:27,704
- And if I don't?
- Please, Zoey.

1134
01:10:28,730 --> 01:10:31,563
You don't have a choice.
I didn't have a choice.

1135
01:10:31,734 --> 01:10:34,901
Zoey. Zoey, don't do it!

1136
01:10:55,138 --> 01:10:56,138
Oh, it's water.

1137
01:10:56,174 --> 01:10:57,300
Ben!

1138
01:10:58,009 --> 01:11:00,064
Ben? No, no!

1139
01:11:00,152 --> 01:11:02,068
- They're filling the room with water!
- No!

1140
01:11:02,104 --> 01:11:03,894
- They're gonna drown me!
- No!

1141
01:11:06,293 --> 01:11:08,959
- Zoey. Zoey, what do I do?
- Ben!

1142
01:11:09,707 --> 01:11:11,249
- I can't get out!
- Ben!

1143
01:11:13,357 --> 01:11:16,200
There's no clues in here!
This isn't a puzzle room!

1144
01:11:16,344 --> 01:11:18,302
How can you do this to us? Make it stop!

1145
01:11:19,207 --> 01:11:20,165
Ben!

1146
01:11:20,232 --> 01:11:21,523
Do something!

1147
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,873
Let me out. I tried! She won't do it!

1148
01:11:25,909 --> 01:11:28,408
This whole thing is a solid cage!

1149
01:11:30,764 --> 01:11:33,223
- It's filling up quickly! Hurry!
- Hey!

1150
01:11:33,811 --> 01:11:36,185
Hey! Let me out! Please.

1151
01:11:39,639 --> 01:11:41,890
I did everything you wanted! Come on!

1152
01:11:42,051 --> 01:11:44,620
Hey! Stop. Stop.

1153
01:11:44,694 --> 01:11:47,564
The glass is too thick. It's too thick.

1154
01:11:47,682 --> 01:11:48,847
Zoey, listen to me.

1155
01:11:48,883 --> 01:11:50,634
Ben, I'm sorry.

1156
01:11:50,726 --> 01:11:52,266
Do not let them win.

1157
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:55,022
Whatever you do, don't let them win.

1158
01:11:55,548 --> 01:11:57,382
This isn't what was supposed to happen.

1159
01:11:57,448 --> 01:11:59,531
- I'm gonna get you out.
- Just say you'll do it!

1160
01:12:00,199 --> 01:12:02,116
I'll never say yes to them. Never!

1161
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:04,664
There's always a way.

1162
01:12:14,689 --> 01:12:17,731
- No, no, no. What are you doing?
- Don't you get it?

1163
01:12:17,767 --> 01:12:21,231
They were never gonna let you out,
like they were never gonna let me out!

1164
01:12:21,267 --> 01:12:23,101
There's no way out of here!

1165
01:12:31,194 --> 01:12:33,404
Whatever you're doing, make it fast!

1166
01:12:36,417 --> 01:12:37,584
Get going!

1167
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:44,659
What is that?

1168
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:53,664
These rooms are just facades built
onto metal frames.

1169
01:12:53,739 --> 01:12:55,031
Oh, shit.

1170
01:12:55,302 --> 01:12:57,177
Metal expands under heat.

1171
01:12:58,165 --> 01:12:59,874
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Stop!

1172
01:13:01,129 --> 01:13:02,713
No, no, no!

1173
01:13:12,372 --> 01:13:13,413
God, no!

1174
01:13:31,178 --> 01:13:33,803
I'm gonna burn
all you fuckers to the ground!

1175
01:13:34,564 --> 01:13:35,564
Do you hear me?

1176
01:13:35,956 --> 01:13:38,164
I'm not playing your game! Not now!

1177
01:13:39,617 --> 01:13:40,743
Not ever!

1178
01:13:43,395 --> 01:13:45,853
Hang on, Ben! Come on.

1179
01:14:09,782 --> 01:14:10,616
Ben?

1180
01:14:11,654 --> 01:14:12,488
Ben.

1181
01:14:14,176 --> 01:14:15,678
Is he okay?

1182
01:14:16,854 --> 01:14:19,853
Hey, hey, hey. I got you. I got you.

1183
01:14:21,309 --> 01:14:23,560
Hey, I got you. I got you.

1184
01:14:23,614 --> 01:14:25,906
Hey, does it look
like that's draining to you?

1185
01:14:25,997 --> 01:14:26,873
Yeah.

1186
01:14:26,939 --> 01:14:28,635
We're gonna make it out, okay?

1187
01:14:28,699 --> 01:14:30,200
Come on. Let's go.

1188
01:14:49,821 --> 01:14:50,822
Keep going.

1189
01:14:53,414 --> 01:14:55,580
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1190
01:15:01,974 --> 01:15:02,807
Come on.

1191
01:15:06,227 --> 01:15:07,311
Come on, come on.

1192
01:15:10,632 --> 01:15:11,961
Hey. The door!

1193
01:15:25,493 --> 01:15:26,326
Go, go, go!

1194
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:32,736
Come on, come on.

1195
01:15:42,846 --> 01:15:45,222
- There! Right!
- Right! Go, go, go!

1196
01:16:12,722 --> 01:16:14,508
We're here reporting live
from a warehouse

1197
01:16:14,544 --> 01:16:17,261
in downtown Manhattan,
where local authorities have

1198
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:20,941
discovered four bodies and evidence
of a grim criminal enterprise.

1199
01:16:21,057 --> 01:16:23,349
We are still getting details,
but we are being told

1200
01:16:23,385 --> 01:16:26,051
these unsuspecting victims
had been lured off the streets

1201
01:16:26,087 --> 01:16:28,337
into what they thought was
a typical escape room,

1202
01:16:28,373 --> 01:16:31,885
only to find out
the stakes were literally life and death.

1203
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:35,075
Now, the criminal organization
behind this is known as Minos.

1204
01:16:35,154 --> 01:16:36,484
Our sources are telling us

1205
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:40,997
that both federal authorities and Interpol
have been after them for some time.

1206
01:16:41,041 --> 01:16:43,749
Three survivors are now working
with local authorities,

1207
01:16:43,817 --> 01:16:46,317
and we'll update you
as the story develops.

1208
01:16:49,876 --> 01:16:51,834
Amanda's giving them everything.

1209
01:16:51,949 --> 01:16:54,581
Proof that she didn't die
in a climbing accident.

1210
01:16:54,617 --> 01:16:56,617
Proof on the rooms and everyone.

1211
01:16:56,684 --> 01:16:58,308
We've got Minos dead to rights.

1212
01:16:59,071 --> 01:17:00,488
What about her daughter?

1213
01:17:01,526 --> 01:17:03,359
They're still looking for her.

1214
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:06,792
Sorry to interrupt.

1215
01:17:06,852 --> 01:17:10,061
I'm Special Agent Freddy Will,
running point on the task force.

1216
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:12,147
I'm sorry nobody believed you before.

1217
01:17:12,183 --> 01:17:15,725
However, because of your actions,
they didn't have time to wipe the place.

1218
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:17,668
Hard drives, client lists...

1219
01:17:17,769 --> 01:17:20,037
We're running raids
across the country as we speak.

1220
01:17:20,143 --> 01:17:21,683
What happens next?

1221
01:17:21,773 --> 01:17:25,190
We build one hell of a case.
My colleagues in Chicago will reach out.

1222
01:17:26,242 --> 01:17:28,075
I believe this is yours.

1223
01:17:29,705 --> 01:17:31,790
We found it in a box with your name on it.

1224
01:17:33,777 --> 01:17:36,403
I never thought I'd see this again.

1225
01:17:36,931 --> 01:17:37,806
Thank you.

1226
01:17:37,989 --> 01:17:40,080
No, thank you. Both of you.

1227
01:17:40,205 --> 01:17:43,725
I'm sure you're both ready
to get back home. We'll be in touch.

1228
01:17:48,587 --> 01:17:49,837
It's over.

1229
01:17:50,451 --> 01:17:51,451
It's really over.

1230
01:17:58,202 --> 01:17:59,160
It's okay.

1231
01:18:00,749 --> 01:18:02,000
I thought I lost you.

1232
01:18:03,873 --> 01:18:05,623
Hey, look, we're free.

1233
01:18:07,541 --> 01:18:09,208
We can go back to normal.

1234
01:18:09,854 --> 01:18:11,063
Whatever that means.

1235
01:18:12,675 --> 01:18:15,175
Eat at restaurants, buy houseplants.

1236
01:18:16,209 --> 01:18:18,334
Not break down in the frozen food section.

1237
01:18:23,455 --> 01:18:28,039
Hey, can I ask you
to do one more thing for me?

1238
01:18:29,139 --> 01:18:30,972
Yeah, sure, anything.

1239
01:18:33,707 --> 01:18:35,415
Would you fly back with me?

1240
01:18:37,573 --> 01:18:38,406
Of course.

1241
01:18:41,286 --> 01:18:43,037
If not now, then when, right?

1242
01:18:45,609 --> 01:18:46,443
Yeah.

1243
01:19:03,548 --> 01:19:04,381
Hey.

1244
01:19:06,915 --> 01:19:09,749
Thanks for coming with me.
I couldn't have done this without you.

1245
01:19:10,603 --> 01:19:11,978
Yeah, of course.

1246
01:19:12,415 --> 01:19:14,915
I wasn't even nervous. I love flying.

1247
01:19:18,483 --> 01:19:19,315
What?

1248
01:19:23,297 --> 01:19:25,089
I don't know. It just...

1249
01:19:26,393 --> 01:19:27,769
You don't have a choice.

1250
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,074
Did it seem a little too easy?

1251
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:34,943
The light leak in the beach,
the tool to remove the cover,

1252
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:36,999
the exposed gas line in the attic,

1253
01:19:37,035 --> 01:19:39,327
my compass.
I mean, how'd they get it so quick?

1254
01:19:39,363 --> 01:19:41,655
You really think
the whole police station was bullshit?

1255
01:19:42,168 --> 01:19:43,543
Why would they let us go?

1256
01:19:44,503 --> 01:19:45,711
It's over.

1257
01:19:48,226 --> 01:19:52,472
Folks, we've reached our cruising altitude
and we have turned off the seat-belt sign.

1258
01:19:52,541 --> 01:19:55,501
- Feel free to move about the cabin.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

1259
01:20:01,326 --> 01:20:02,202
Our time is up.

1260
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:14,339
Dr. Soans?

1261
01:20:18,649 --> 01:20:19,983
Do I know you, dear?

1262
01:20:20,703 --> 01:20:23,078
I'm sorry, you look like someone I know.

1263
01:20:24,695 --> 01:20:27,320
Every single thing you see is a clue.

1264
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:29,359
This is a clue.

1265
01:20:30,161 --> 01:20:31,077
This is a clue.

1266
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,856
This is a clue.

1267
01:20:35,132 --> 01:20:38,173
What would it take
to get you on that plane?

1268
01:20:38,312 --> 01:20:39,755
I need to know that the criminals

1269
01:20:39,791 --> 01:20:43,333
who killed the four people in front of me
are held accountable for what they did.

1270
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:45,174
We're running raids across the country.

1271
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:46,266
And I need to know

1272
01:20:46,302 --> 01:20:49,270
that they're never going to do it again
to me or to anyone else.

1273
01:20:49,306 --> 01:20:50,932
We've got Minos dead to rights.

1274
01:20:51,970 --> 01:20:52,970
We're free.

1275
01:20:53,101 --> 01:20:56,143
Then, and only then,
will this all be over.

1276
01:20:57,591 --> 01:21:01,116
Tell us, Zoey, did we do
a good job convincing you?

1277
01:21:01,341 --> 01:21:02,341
Zoey, what's happening?

1278
01:21:03,893 --> 01:21:04,893
Shit!

1279
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:11,129
The game only ends
when we say it ends.

1280
01:21:11,619 --> 01:21:13,577
Thanks for flying Minos Air.
