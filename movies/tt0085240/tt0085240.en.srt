<font color="#fefefe">of meeting you!</font>

746

<font color="#fefefe">There's a man</font>
<font color="#fefefe">who is still thinking of you.</font>

<font color="#fefefe">You're a bully, not a teacher.</font>

<font color="#fefefe">- Why?</font>

780
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:43,125
<font color="#fefefe">Happiness is a serious thing.</font>

781
01:11:43,607 --> 01:11:44,801
<font color="#fefefe">Meaning?</font>

782

<font color="#fefefe">Without blemish, without pain.</font>
<font color="#fefefe">lt's always difficult.</font>

<font color="#fefefe">Situations...</font>

785
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:59,356
<font color="#fefefe">Why this decision,</font>
<font color="#fefefe">when nothing has happened?</font>

786
01:11:59,527 --> 01:12:01,404
<font color="#fefefe">Sooner or later you'll leave me.</font>

01:12:01,527 --> 01:12:04,724
<font color="#fefefe">l can't bear the thought</font>
<font color="#fefefe">that one day, maybe on a terrace,</font>

788
01:12:04,767 --> 01:12:07,565
<font color="#fefefe">you living at my place,</font>

<font color="#fefefe">you break off now without a reason.</font>

793
01:12:22,567 --> 01:12:23,636
<font color="#fefefe">Yes.</font>

794
01:12:25,487 --> 01:12:28,843
<font color="#fefefe">You make judgments,</font>
<font color="#fefefe">you accuse, you condemn.</font>

795
01:12:29,007 --> 01:12:31,919
<font color="#fefefe">l judge myself,</font>
<font color="#fefefe">why can't l judge the others.</font>

796
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:35,517
<font color="#fefefe">People aren't mathematical theorems.</font>
<font color="#fefefe">You're crazy.</font>

797
01:12:35,927 --> 01:12:37,838
<font color="#fefefe">And those who accept everything?</font>

798
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:41,118
<font color="#fefefe">At least l say: ''This is healthy,</font>
<font color="#fefefe">this is sick, this is lovely''</font>

799
01:12:41,207 --> 01:12:44,324

800
01:12:45,287 --> 01:12:46,800
<font color="#fefefe">You really are crazy.</font>

801
01:12:48,567 --> 01:12:53,163
<font color="#fefefe">Yes. Does such suffering</font>
<font color="#fefefe">seem right to you? Not to me.</font>

802
01:12:54,767 --> 01:12:56,485
<font color="#fefefe">l must protect myself.</font>

908
01:24:44,807 --> 01:24:48,561
<font color="#fefefe">all those wonderful ltalian mothers</font>
<font color="#fefefe">waiting for their children,</font>

<font color="#fefefe">they'll ask the teachers:</font>
<font color="#fefefe">''How's my Federica doing?''</font>

913
01:25:01,967 --> 01:25:05,880
<font color="#fefefe">You talk of mothers, nursery,</font>
<font color="#fefefe">schools, shoes, summer of 1972.</font>

914
01:25:05,967 --> 01:25:08,686
<font color="#fefefe">Next comes the story</font>
<font color="#fefefe">of your generation.</font>

918
01:25:18,247 --> 01:25:21,956
<font color="#fefefe">One year it snowed, another</font>
<font color="#fefefe">there was talk of a coup d'יtat</font>

919
01:25:22,607 --> 01:25:27,727
<font color="#fefefe">Then one summer we decided to go</font>

920
01:25:28,407 --> 01:25:33,242
<font color="#fefefe">To see a colonel, a certain</font>
<font color="#fefefe">Otelo de Carvalho. Who was he?</font>

<font color="#fefefe">l'm hoping that you're playing</font>
<font color="#fefefe">a joke on to the Police.</font>

923
01:25:44,007 --> 01:25:46,077
<font color="#fefefe">Why's that curtain always closed?</font>

924
01:25:46,167 --> 01:25:49,637
<font color="#fefefe">Too many people passing by.</font>
<font color="#fefefe">lt annoys me.</font>

<font color="#fefefe">l ride department store escalators.</font>

927
01:25:58,247 --> 01:26:02,160
<font color="#fefefe">All those people</font>
<font color="#fefefe">trying to keep up with the times:</font>

928
01:26:02,647 --> 01:26:05,878
<font color="#fefefe">secretaries, bank clerks,</font>
<font color="#fefefe">housewives, all normal people,</font>

<font color="#fefefe">because their lives are dull.</font>

930

<font color="#fefefe">My students say:</font>

931
01:26:10,887 --> 01:26:13,606
<font color="#fefefe">''l'd rather die than work in a bank''.</font>

932
01:26:13,727 --> 01:26:17,686
<font color="#fefefe">Why do they hate people</font>
<font color="#fefefe">who punch a time clock?</font>

933
01:26:17,847 --> 01:26:21,726
<font color="#fefefe">Despise the people</font>
<font color="#fefefe">who go to local beaches...</font>

934
01:26:22,047 --> 01:26:25,164
<font color="#fefefe">Professor, stop for a moment,</font>
<font color="#fefefe">just tell me...</font>

935

<font color="#fefefe">Come in!</font>

938
01:26:34,407 --> 01:26:37,365
<font color="#fefefe">Excuse me. For the Professor...</font>

939
01:26:38,047 --> 01:26:39,241
<font color="#fefefe">- What is it?</font>
<font color="#fefefe">- A cake.</font>

940
01:26:39,367 --> 01:26:40,322
<font color="#fefefe">A profiterole.</font>

941
01:26:40,407 --> 01:26:43,922
<font color="#fefefe">The pastry shop downstairs</font>
<font color="#fefefe">is the best in Rome.</font>

942
01:26:44,407 --> 01:26:48,116
<font color="#fefefe">You went out and bought it?</font>
<font color="#fefefe">What is it?</font>

943
01:26:48,687 --> 01:26:52,919
<font color="#fefefe">The Professor offered us one.</font>
<font color="#fefefe">You too.</font>

944
01:26:53,327 --> 01:26:56,125
<font color="#fefefe">- Beat it!</font>
<font color="#fefefe">- lt's here.</font>

945
01:26:58,447 --> 01:27:02,599
<font color="#fefefe">Don't you dare!</font>
<font color="#fefefe">How did it happen?</font>

946
01:27:03,247 --> 01:27:08,560
<font color="#fefefe">lt's not simple. There's a lot to</font>
<font color="#fefefe">explain. You have to start with shoes.</font>

947
01:27:09,167 --> 01:27:12,079
<font color="#fefefe">Start with the shoes,</font>
<font color="#fefefe">start wherever you like.</font>

948
01:27:12,487 --> 01:27:16,116
<font color="#fefefe">You know those shoes,</font>
<font color="#fefefe">''espadrilles''? Without laces.</font>

949
01:27:16,887 --> 01:27:19,606
<font color="#fefefe">Now they're common,</font>
<font color="#fefefe">but some years ago</font>

950
01:27:19,687 --> 01:27:24,681
<font color="#fefefe">girls wore them down at the heels,</font>
<font color="#fefefe">as if they were slippers.</font>

951
01:27:25,127 --> 01:27:28,756
<font color="#fefefe">This annoyed me,</font>
<font color="#fefefe">it seemed dirty, insolent,</font>

952
01:27:28,927 --> 01:27:31,316
<font color="#fefefe">but at the same time excited me.</font>

953
01:27:33,727 --> 01:27:37,322
<font color="#fefefe">- Can l open?</font>
<font color="#fefefe">- Go ahead you'll only see...</font>

954
01:27:38,687 --> 01:27:41,076
<font color="#fefefe">There... every shoe has its own walk</font>

955
01:27:41,247 --> 01:27:44,159
<font color="#fefefe">which represent</font>
<font color="#fefefe">a different vision of the world.</font>

956
01:27:44,887 --> 01:27:47,117
<font color="#fefefe">Want comfort at home?</font>

957
01:27:47,207 --> 01:27:50,005
<font color="#fefefe">Wear anything you like,</font>
<font color="#fefefe">but not slippers.</font>

958
01:27:50,367 --> 01:27:53,279
<font color="#fefefe">Women can wear</font>
<font color="#fefefe">those Chinese canvas shoes.</font>

959
01:27:53,367 --> 01:27:55,835
<font color="#fefefe">l've never liked them much:</font>

960
01:27:55,887 --> 01:28:00,278
<font color="#fefefe">those violent colors:</font>
<font color="#fefefe">red-red, blue-blue, black-black;</font>

961
01:28:00,687 --> 01:28:04,646
<font color="#fefefe">then they are low-cut.</font>
<font color="#fefefe">You almost see the toes.</font>

962
01:28:05,087 --> 01:28:08,716
<font color="#fefefe">Exciting me with your toes?</font>
<font color="#fefefe">Then show me an ankle!</font>

963
01:28:09,207 --> 01:28:11,277
<font color="#fefefe">l'm not sick, no...</font>

964
01:28:21,647 --> 01:28:25,799
<font color="#fefefe">Those are the sandals</font>
<font color="#fefefe">l wore as a child,</font>

965
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:29,277
<font color="#fefefe">when we went to the sea...</font>
<font color="#fefefe">What's the mother like?</font>

966
01:28:32,487 --> 01:28:35,285
<font color="#fefefe">l understood you through your shoes.</font>

967
01:28:35,327 --> 01:28:38,125
<font color="#fefefe">You've suffered...</font>
<font color="#fefefe">Just one pair of shoes</font>

968
01:28:38,207 --> 01:28:41,085
<font color="#fefefe">which slowly wear out,</font>
<font color="#fefefe">get scuffed, fade.</font>

969
01:28:41,767 --> 01:28:45,316
<font color="#fefefe">When l saw your shoes,</font>
<font color="#fefefe">l wanted to tell you.</font>

970
01:28:45,527 --> 01:28:46,596
<font color="#fefefe">What?</font>

971
01:28:46,727 --> 01:28:49,480
<font color="#fefefe">l was the one. l did it.</font>

972
01:28:49,647 --> 01:28:52,366
<font color="#fefefe">Why? You were friends.</font>
<font color="#fefefe">What did they do?</font>

973
01:28:52,767 --> 01:28:56,362
<font color="#fefefe">They disappointed me. Friends</font>
<font color="#fefefe">can do that, normal people can't.</font>

974
01:28:56,567 --> 01:28:58,478
<font color="#fefefe">Couples should be happy.</font>

975
01:28:58,647 --> 01:29:01,366
<font color="#fefefe">l help them, set them straight,</font>
<font color="#fefefe">give advise,</font>

976
01:29:01,927 --> 01:29:05,044
<font color="#fefefe">but not when they make</font>
<font color="#fefefe">such stupid mistakes.</font>

977
01:29:06,487 --> 01:29:10,116
<font color="#fefefe">They start telling each other lies,</font>
<font color="#fefefe">they separate,</font>

978
01:29:11,007 --> 01:29:13,567
<font color="#fefefe">get together again,</font>
<font color="#fefefe">but it's too late,</font>

979
01:29:13,727 --> 01:29:17,436
<font color="#fefefe">they're hurt, become mean.</font>
<font color="#fefefe">l've finished with them.</font>

980
