00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,280
<i>Transatlantic 473,</i>

4
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,760
<i>we've vacated the runway
for landing for you.</i>

5
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,520
<i>You are on line one, four, zero, four.</i>

6
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,080
<i>Keep a low angle.</i>

7
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,640
Seventeen-degree approach is fine.

8
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,280
<i>Now extend the landing gear.</i>

9
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,400
Welcome to our airbase, sir.
Everything is cleared.

10
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,800
The plane is approaching.
We assume captain and copilot are dead.

11
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,160
Thank you. Keep your men back.
We'll take it from here.

12
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,600
- Alan, together again. What's the status?
- We checked the passenger manifest.

13
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,280
At least one passenger on board
is on the German terrorist watch list.

14
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,240
The sniper team is already in position.

15
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,360
One there, one around the back.
I'll let you two crack on.

16
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,760
Leave the autopilot on.
I'll give you step-by-step instructions.

17
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,280
- Watch your approach angle.
- As you were.

18
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,720
- There it is.
- Turn off the autopilot now.

19
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,240
Just make sure the nose on the altitude
indicator doesn't sink below the horizon.

20
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,200
Watch your approach angle. Not so steep!

21
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,360
Okay, move!

22
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,920
It'll bump a little on landing,
but don't worry.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,960
As soon as you touch down,
keep both feet on the brakes.

24
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,640
Step on the brakes!

25
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,400
Now! Floor it!

26
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,440
Anybody got a visual?

27
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,320
<i>- </i>Adult male. He ducked.
<i>- Team 2?</i>

28
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,520
- Negative, sir.
- Let me have that.

29
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,080
Transatlantic 473,
this is Colonel Alan Drummond.

30
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,520
<i>I'm in charge here on the ground.
Please tell us the situation on board.</i>

31
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,480
<i>Transatlantic 473, please advise
what the situation is on board.</i>

32
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,920
<i>Is anybody hurt? We're here to help you.</i>

33
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,720
- Where can he go from the cockpit?
- The passenger cabin or down here.

34
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,040
The instrument room and front cargo bay.

35
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,520
Shortwave radio activity!

36
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,560
<i>Priming the detonator now.</i>

37
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,680
- What's he saying?
- He's talking about an explosive device.

38
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,600
<i>Don't trigger until we are safe.</i>

39
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,600
- He wants to ignite when safe.
- Explosives on board.

40
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,920
I repeat, explosives on board.
Take all appropriate safety measures.

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,560
Have ordnance standing by.

42
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,920
Movement by the rear hatch.

43
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,520
<i>P2, affirmative.
Free line of sight, 320 meters.</i>

44
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,520
<i>It's a boy. He's unarmed.</i>

45
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,000
Don't shoot.

46
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,600
<i>I repeat, don't shoot.</i>

47
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,160
- Get the boy out of there.
- The boy's clean. Let's go.

48
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,960
Male subject back in cockpit.

49
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,720
Free line of fire?

50
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,160
P1, affirmative.
Free line of fire, 300 meters.

51
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,960
P2, affirmative.
Free line of fire, 320 meters.

52
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,840
Do not move.
We will open fire at the first movement.

53
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,680
I repeat. If you move, we will open fire.

54
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,200
Hands on your head.

55
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,840
Now slowly climb into the pilot seat.

56
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,120
Put the headset on.
And very, very slowly, show me your hands.

57
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,480
<i>Let me get out.
I'll explain everything to you.</i>

58
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,600
No, you'll do what I tell you to.

59
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,280
<i>You have to believe me. I'm no terrorist.</i>

60
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,560
Hands behind your head
where we can see them.

61
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,680
<i>I'm injured!</i>

62
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,240
I will help you
when you let the passengers off the plane.

63
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,840
How many terrorists are there?
How are they armed? Is anyone hurt?

64
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,480
I need to know as much as possible
before I send my men in there.

65
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,280
I'll try my best.

66
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,000
You're quite the athlete, aren't you?

67
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
Hot chocolate?

68
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,120
I'm Naomi.

69
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,320
I work for the police.

70
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,000
What's your name?

71
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,320
There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.
You're safe here.

72
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,080
Anything else you want? Cookies, maybe?

73
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,320
Can you tell me what happened
on the plane?

74
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Were you traveling with your parents?

75
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,360
<i>The Dow Jones in the USA.</i>

76
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,760
<i>Worldwide, the markets are showing
an eight percent surge in only one week,</i>

77
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,120
<i>driven mainly
by the airline stock numbers.</i>

78
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,560
<i>Analysts predict
a strong course correction</i>,

79
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,560
<i>which means the market might face
some instability for some time.</i>

80
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
<i>So in spite of the market's current high,</i>

81
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,960
<i>it's still a risky moment
in terms of investment opportunity.</i>

82
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,640
<i>That volatility is also confirmed by</i>

83
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,440
<i>the fact that gold
is at a new seven-year high.</i>

84
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,240
<i>Market power often comes from genuine
innovation for businesses and malls.</i>

85
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
Hello.

86
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,320
Hello.

87
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,080
Where's your mother?

88
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,400
She'll be here soon.
She told me to check our bags.

89
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,800
Hey, wait a second. I'll help you.

90
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,960
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

91
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,440
What have you got in there?
Rocks?

92
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,520
<i>Moving forward with the grand tour,
this is our radiation therapy.</i>

93
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,200
<i>- And there's Sarah. Say hi, Sarah.
- Hi.</i>

94
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,720
How many will it take?

95
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,160
<i>Oh, we'll see.
Nothing to worry about.</i>

96
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,160
Okay.

97
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,520
<i>This will be your room.</i>

98
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,360
<i>Forty-eight-inch TV with all the streaming
services, so you won't get bored.</i>

99
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,160
Oh, excuse me, I have to hang up.
It's my son.

100
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,120
<i>He's a great kid.
I look forward to meeting him.</i>

101
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,880
<i>Have a good flight.
See you at the airport.</i>

102
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,040
Okay, bye.

103
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,720
- Hey, little man.
- I checked the luggage.

104
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,680
- I didn't have any problems.
<i>- You're awesome.</i>

105
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,480
<i>- Elias?</i>
- Yeah?

106
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,040
I love you.

107
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,080
See you in a bit, Mom.

108
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,320
Mom!

109
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Mom!

110
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,800
There you are. Oh, sweetheart.

111
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,120
There you are. You did great.

112
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
Is this yours?

113
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
Yeah.

114
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,480
I have a prescript.

115
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,080
Okay, my love.

116
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,880
Mommy will be right back, okay?
You stay here.

117
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,400
- Okay, I promise.
- Good.

118
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,640
Okay, okay.

119
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,640
I don't understand.
You booked me a new flight.

120
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,120
Now I'm landing at 5:55 in Pennsylvania
and arriving at 7:10.

121
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,440
A.m. or p.m., huh?

122
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,600
Ah, great. Okay, then I can lie down.
Okay, good night.

123
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,560
Good morning.

124
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,880
- Excuse me?
- Good morning.

125
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,640
In America, it's daytime.

126
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,240
Okay, look, we're here.

127
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,400
It's night here.
And New York is over there, to the west.

128
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,880
It's day there now.
And we're flying this way,

129
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,040
but the earth turns this way.

130
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,640
So night will be five hours longer for us.

131
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,320
And we land at night,
and it will be morning here.

132
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,280
Wow.
That was a real scientific presentation.

133
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,080
- Is your mother back yet?
- She's taking her medicine.

134
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,240
But there's a doctor in America,
Dr. Brown, who can help her.

135
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,560
He can kill off her bad blood
and implant new bone marrow.

136
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,000
So she will start making new,
healthy blood.

137
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,120
You know, I'm a scientist too, physicist.
I'm going to America for a convention.

138
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,240
- I'm Elias.
- I'm Farid.

139
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,560
- You have siblings.
- No, no siblings.

140
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,520
- Do you have a favorite team?
- Dragons.

141
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Elias.

142
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,320
Cool.

143
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,560
Elias.

144
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,920
Oh, Mom. This is Farid.

145
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,560
He helped me with the luggage.

146
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,040
- W... Would you like to sit down?
- No, thanks.

147
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,800
He's a bright boy you got there.

148
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,000
Mm-hmm. He sure is.

149
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
Come on, honey.

150
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
Welcome.

151
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,760
Here, Mom.

152
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,760
Sorry, this is ours.

153
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,560
Rainer, no need to be rude.

154
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,440
Those are our compartments.

155
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,880
Just sit, dear.

156
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,120
- Are you comfortable?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Everything up there?

157
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Hey.

158
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,480
<i>Welcome from the cockpit.</i>

159
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,440
<i>As we've completed boarding,
we're ready to go and start as scheduled.</i>

160
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,160
<i>My name is Bastian Buchner, second officer
on today's flight to New York.</i>

161
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,840
<i>Please enjoy your time on board
and have a pleasant, safe trip.</i>

162
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,120
We are cleared to New York
via Rome departure route.

163
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,680
Uh-huh.

164
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,720
So... would you like some coffee, gentlemen?

165
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,360
- Oh yeah. I'll take...
- Black, two sugars?

166
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,640
- You're the best, Julia.
- And one with lots of milk?

167
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Bastian?

168
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
Yeah, right, sure.

169
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,280
Double whiskey, gorgeous.

170
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,640
- Hey!
- Robert, the guy in 1A is all yours.

171
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,480
Sure thing, honey.

172
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,680
The new guy fits all the clichés.

173
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,640
- Are you jealous?
- Excuse me?

174
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,640
Well, now you're not the only one
going after the copilot.

175
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,560
Bitch.

176
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,880
<i>You'll find that
the safety instructions have been placed</i>

177
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,800
<i>in the seat pockets in front of you.</i>

178
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,440
<i>We are currently third in line
for takeoff and expected to be in the air</i>

179
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,000
<i>in approximately seven minutes.</i>

180
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,840
<i>We ask that you please
fasten your seat belts</i>

181
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,920
<i>and secure all your baggage under your
seat or in the overhead compartments.</i>

182
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,640
<i>We also ask
that your seats and tray tables</i>

183
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,160
<i>are in the upright position.</i>

184
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,440

185
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,200

191
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,280
Oh.

192
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,160
Fuck.

193
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,320
Shush. It's all right.

194
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,920
It's all right.

195
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,080
Damn it.

196
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
So?

197
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,720
No idea.

198
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,920
What should we do?

199
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
Fuck.

200
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,320
You wait in the car. I'll get help.

201
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
Nikolai!

202
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,640
Damn.

203
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
Excuse me!

204
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,600
Stewardess!

205
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,160
- Sir?
- The Internet is down.

206
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,600
Sorry, but that happens.
We're in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

207
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,120
Your airline guarantees
uninterrupted onboard Internet service.

208
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,600
- No! I need to get out of here.
- Sir, sit down.

209
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,560
- No, no, leave me alone.
- I assure you, sir.

210
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,040
Don't touch me
when I tell you not to, okay?

211
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,800
I'm not sitting down right now.

212
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,696
- What is it?
- Someone's freaking out.

213
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,560
I told you not to touch me.

214
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,880
- No need to cause trouble.
- Hey, hey, hey, sir...

215
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,040
Take it easy, calm down, man.
Take a deep breath.

216
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,200
Everything's fine, honey.
Go back to sleep.

217
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,720
I'm an air marshal, sir.

218
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,000
You are threatening the security
of the passengers.

219
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,240
If you calm down, I can let go of you.
Do you understand?

220
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,080
Hey, Michael. Do you need any help?

221
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,520
No worries. I've got it.

222
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,080
Calm down, please, sir.

223
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,520
Just calm down.

224
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,800
And take a deep breath. What's your name?

225
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,720
I'm calming down...

226
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,680
Where is the third one of you?

227
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,040
One D. Where is he?

228
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,000
One delta.

229
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,120
Oh, by the way, my name is Karl.

230
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,000
Eightball, it's done.

231
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,880
It's enough! Enough!

232
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,040
Enough. Stop it.

233
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,000
It's enough. It's enough.

234
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,520
What's wrong with this guy?

235
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,520
Ladies and gentlemen.

236
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,760
Excuse the disturbance.
Everything is in control.

237
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,560
Okay, remain seated...

238
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,440
and, uh...

239
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,760
enjoy the rest of the flight!

240
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,840
Remain seated!

241
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,120
Hey,
what's going on back there?

242
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,720
Get back!

243
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,520
- What the fuck?
- Get back!

244
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,160
Please remain seated, everybody!

245
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,520
Everyone to the back of the plane.
Don't take anything.

246
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,200
- Heard? Don't take anything.
- This door is secured, you can't...

247
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,040
I gave him the drops.

248
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,360
Now listen up! We'll clear
this section. Put your hands on your head...

249
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,600
Let's go. What are you waiting for?

250
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,600
Get up!

251
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,160
Hurry up!

252
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,840
I said, get the fuck up!

253
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,960
Open the hatch.

254
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,600
Welcome aboard.

255
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,720
Go on.

256
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,480
There, there.

257
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,440
- There's a window seat.
- Come on! Move it!

258
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,520
Okay.

259
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,560
Up, up, up!

260
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,560
- Come on!
- You, move it!

261
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,120
- Move it!
- Faster! Come on!

262
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,360
Sit down.

263
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,560
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.

264
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,840
Funny motherfuckers.

265
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,040
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls.

266
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,880
<i>As you can see,
we have control of the plane.</i>

267
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,320
<i>Our one demand is strictly monetary.
If met, you're free.</i>

268
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,960
<i>We want this little operation of ours
to go off without a hitch.</i>

269
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,960
<i>If not... hmm...</i>

270
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,960
<i>Use your imaginations.</i>

271
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,440
<i>Everyone, please place your hands
on the seat in front so we can see them.</i>

272
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,320
<i>Eyes to the ground. Thank you.</i>

273
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,920
<i>Oh, and remember.</i>

274
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,240
<i>Big smile. Big smile.</i>

275
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,680
What's wrong with you?
Hands up! Or I break them off!

276
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,120
That goes for all of you!
Keep your heads down!

277
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,000
Mama.

278
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,960
Mama.

279
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,320
- What?
- Cut it out, Eightball!

280
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,280
It's enough.

281
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,400
Leave it!

282
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,520
Black box is reprogrammed.

283
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,640
We're turning around.

284
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,840
No.

285
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,680
Everything is fine, sweetie.

286
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,360
I'm sure they're just avoiding a storm.
Don't worry.

287
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,080
Look ahead.

288
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,200
<i>Transatlantic 473,
this is Shannon Airport.</i>

289
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,760
<i>We've lost your ACARS signal.
What's your status?</i>

290
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,160
This is Transatlantic 473.

291
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,320
We have a little technical problem,
nothing serious. Hold it.

292
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,480
<i>Roger that. You'll reach
Greenland flight zone in 700 miles.</i>

293
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,920
<i>Relay your position via radio
while you're evaluating the malfunction.</i>

294
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,120
Elias, cut it out.

295
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,240
Put it back.

296
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,560
- We can hide down here.
- Stop it now. Put it back.

297
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,520
Farid al Adwa?

298
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,360
Yes?

299
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,120
Peace be upon you.

300
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,200
Get up.

301
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,800
Why?

302
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,000
Come on! Get the fuck up.

303
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,720
Elias, I said stop it!

304
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,400
- Go!
- Move!

305
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,120
<i>Yallah! </i>Move it, fucker.

306
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,360
Stop!

307
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,320
- Stop it. This is unnecessary.
- What? What? What?

308
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,920
Why are you doing this, huh?
We don't need this drama.

309
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,720
Why you're making so much drama?
It's not necessary.

310
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,640
Hey!

311
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,480
It was just my son.

312
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,560
Hey! Don't! No, no, no, no!

313
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
Mom!

314
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,520
Mom!

315
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,840
What the fuck are you doing?
You fucking maniac.

316
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,640
You little psycho!

317
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,200
I can't breathe.

318
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,640
- Hey! Get up!
- No! No!

319
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,880
- What's the matter with you?
- Help me!

320
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,376
- No, but he's a kid.
- Shut up! Move!

321
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,640
Okay, okay.

322
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,800
Hey!

323
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,040
Sit down. Sit down.

324
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,680
Scoot over. Scoot!

325
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,520
Scoot over. Listen, listen.

326
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,960
I need you to stay here. Can you do that?

327
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,840
Promise me.

328
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,280
- Move!
- What happened?

329
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,400
Eightball shot a passenger.

330
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,960
What the fuck?

331
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,600
She got up without permission.

332
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,680
Hmm.

333
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,720
If you fuck up again,

334
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,080
I'm gonna kill you myself.

335
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,240
Now get out of here, fucking psycho.

336
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,240
Ladies and gentlemen, that's what happens
when anyone tries to play hero.

337
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,720
We don't like heroes. Not on my plane.

338
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,960
Make sure he doesn't fuck up again.

339
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,200
My pleasure.

340
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,600
Might as well shoot him now.

341
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,480
It's all right.

342
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,560
It's all right.

343
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,240
It's all right.

344
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,240
Nikolai?

345
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,680
Nikolai!

346
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,280
Nikolai?

347
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Nikolai!

348
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,560
Nikolai?

349
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,240
Nikolai?

350
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,240
Nikolai!

351
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It's all right.

352
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,080
Oh God!

353
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,240
Now keep your hands up
and heads down.

354
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,080
Hey, you, look down.

355
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,240
This airplane is now
under our control.

356
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,800
We are faithful soldiers of the Caliphate,

357
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,920
who have abandoned this life
to strike terror in your hearts

358
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,760
and to set hellfire
over the city of London.

359
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,680
Seeking death to humiliate you infidels
is our highest honor for us.

360
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,160
We are glad to sacrifice ourselves
for the path of righteousness.

361
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,360
The question is,
what are you willing to do

362
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,200
to defend your cities
of decadence and perversion?

363
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,440
A thousand times you have been warned.

364
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,680
Today you pay the price
for your ignorance.

365
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,520
What?

366
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,240
- I cannot read Arabic.
- You spent five years in Egypt.

367
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,560
What kind of Islamist are you?

368
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,760
I don't belong to those guys anymore.

369
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,040
Give it to him.

370
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,960
Rejoice

371
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,800
communi... community of...

372
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,720
Muslims.

373
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,200
Rejoice, community of Muslims.

374
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,000
In our blessed martyrdom,
Allah the Almighty has allowed us

375
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,280
to carry out an attack on godless Europe.

376
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,520
I have been forced to read this message.

377
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,960
We have nothing to do with the hijacking.
Please help us. <i>Allah Akbar.</i>

378
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,560
Fuck!

379
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,480
Read it how it's written.

380
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,920
Hm.

381
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,920
Too tall for this bullshit.

382
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,920
You ain't got a problem
'cause you're like three feet tall.

383
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,760
Calm down, Hightower.

384
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,800
You got jokes.

385
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,720
Man, shut up, you damn mutts!

386
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,800
Loud-ass, fucking dogs.

387
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,480
Yeah.

388
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,640
All right, you've got 15 minutes.

389
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,360
Damn mutts.

390
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,040
Damn it.

391
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,840
Move it.

392
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,400
Sit down. Sit your ass down.

393
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,520
Hey! Where... where are you going? Stop!

394
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,880
Hey! Stop, I said!

395
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,080
Already?

396
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,400
<i>Jurij, come in.</i>

397
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,240
<i>Is the jump prepped?</i>

398
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,040
Jurij, come in. Do you read me?

399
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,360
<i>Ten minutes to jump.
What's the status of the charge?</i>

400
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,800
<i>Jurij, you Czech bastard. Do you hear me?</i>

401
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,320
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

402
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:57,240
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time
for us to say goodbye to you now.

403
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:02,160
For our own safety and protection,
we booby-trapped this plane.

404
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,120
If anyone should rush forward
or try to follow us,

405
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,840
a toxic nerve gas will be released.

406
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,960
In that case, please use your gas masks.

407
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,680
Just put it slightly over your nose
and breathe normal.

408
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,680
Oh, sorry, that's right.
You don't have any gas masks.

409
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,480
So, please observe the fasten
seat belt signs above your heads,

410
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,280
and remain seated
for the rest of the flight.

411
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,040
We realize that you have
a choice of airlines

412
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,240
and would like to thank you
for flying with Transatlantic tonight.

413
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,600
Good night. Sleep tight.

414
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,760
Nice flight.

415
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,800
Hair spray cans?

416
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,480
Nice try.

417
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,680
Fake it 'til you make it.

418
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,560
- Put your mask on.
- There's no need for it.

419
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,720
Jurij!

420
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,360
Where the fuck are you?

421
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,120
Oh whoa.

422
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,000
Oh wow.

423
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,280
What the hell happened to you?

424
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,640
Elias! Elias!

425
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,320
Mama. Mama. Mama.

426
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,320
You can't do that. You can't do that.

427
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,480
Go back to your seats!

428
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,160
Okay.

429
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,040
- I thought you were dead.
- Everything is fine, honey.

430
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,600
We have to turn the plane around,
then everything will be fine.

431
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,880
Go, go.

432
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,200
Don't... Don't look over there.

433
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,000
Don't look.

434
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,120
Fuck.

435
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,080
Forty-three miles to target area.

436
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,560
Where is the pilot?

437
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,880
The pilot, where is he?

438
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,160
The pilot is dead.

439
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,360
Okay.

440
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,080
Does anyone... Does anyone on board
know how to fly a plane?

441
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,240
Is there anyone here who knows how to fly?

442
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,640
Answer me!

443
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,040
Is there anyone who knows
how to fly a fucking plane?

444
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,080
- What are you doing?
- I'm an aerospace engineering student.

445
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,960
Sit down! They'll kill all of us.

446
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,800
We're gonna die anyway.

447
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,160
What? What are you talking about?

448
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,640
An Arab student with flight experience
fits the profile perfectly.

449
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,360
Brother, why New York?

450
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,240
- I'm going to a convention.
- Move.

451
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,880
- Me too.
- Come on. Come on.

452
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,200
They set us up.
They made us read a statement

453
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,760
saying we wanted
to crash the airplane in London.

454
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,640
Either we die
or the British shoot us down.

455
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,520
- Nonsense. They're not terrorists.
- Oh yeah?

456
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,080
Why? Because they don't have beards
and pray towards Mecca?

457
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,160
They want to influence the stock market.

458
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,560
The market's overheated.

459
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,040
When another 9/11 happens,
prices will tank.

460
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,840
You could make billions from shorting.

461
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,080
He thinks
they wanna crash the stock market.

462
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,880
Like that bombing a few years ago.
The soccer club.

463
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,720
They want to change
the outcome of the election.

464
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,440
Whatever. If we don't do anything,
we're gonna die. That's for sure.

465
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,240
We have to do something now.

466
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,400
Just before the election.
Remember Madrid 2004?

467
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,760
I've spent a few hours
on a flight simulator, but I...

468
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,840
Hey...

469
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,160
T-minus ten minutes to drop zone,
awaiting go.

470
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,040
- <i>We're on position.</i>
- Got it.

471
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,520
Who are those guys down there?

472
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,000
- I don't want to end up as shark bait.
- Make sure you have your GPS on.

473
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,880
Who's going to get his mil?

474
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,440
It'll be all right. I promise.

475
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,520
Hey.

476
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,360
Did you drink blood?

477
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,840
You have to take your medicine.

478
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,560
Hey, everything okay in there?

479
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,040
That wasn't me.

480
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,560
They've got the autopilot on.

481
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,920
Don't.

482
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,200
Let them jump first.

483
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,960
She's alive.

484
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,960
Where is she?

485
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,160
They're in the cockpit.

486
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,480
No, wait!

487
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,040
- Get the fuck back to economy.
- Shit.

488
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,720
Shit.

489
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,520
Open the door!

490
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,600
- Turn the plane around.
- What?

491
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,400
I said turn the plane around!

492
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,880
We're closer
to Europe right now.

493
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,640
Shit!

494
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,040
Open the door!

495
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,960
Turn around! Now!

496
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,600
They're turning.

497
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,200
- One!
- No, please don't!

498
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,600
<i>- Please don't!
- Two!</i>

499
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,200
<i>Three!</i>

500
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,080
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

501
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,840
We got 200 more passengers
on this plane.

502
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,680
We can play this game all night long.

503
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,840
Give me another one.

504
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,200
What the fuck you looking at? Go!

505
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,560
No! Please, don't. Please, don't.

506
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,520
- I'm begging you, please.
- No!

507
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,160
Stop it, you psycho!
What the fuck are you doing?

508
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,680
Put the fucking knife away,
or I'll put a fucking bullet in your head.

509
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,400
Why is this taking so long?
Get me another passenger.

510
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,160
Sit down. Sit back. Put your hands up.

511
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,720
No!

512
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,120
- Put your hands up!
- No!

513
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:42,720
What?

514
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,960
No!

515
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,520
- <i>Where the fuck are you?
- </i>Delayed. Will transmit new coordinates.

516
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,880
Fuck!

517
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,680
All these deaths,

518
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,520
they're on your hands.

519
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,400
Sweetheart.

520
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,040
It's okay.

521
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,600
Do you wanna see
who drives the plane? Come on.

522
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,200
<i>- </i>No.
- One.

523
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,040
Two.

524
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,520
Three!

525
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,400
Mama!

526
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,320
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Stop screaming!

527
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,120
Run, run.

528
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,840
Fuck! Get back! Get back! Get back!

529
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,800
- What the fuck?
- Go! Just go!

530
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,000
What is going on?

531
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,480
What the fuck is this?

532
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,680
Elias!

533
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,600
Elias, open the door. Elias!

534
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,680
Don't...

535
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,680
Don't...

536
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,680
Don't be afraid.

537
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,400
I won't hurt you.

538
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,960
Mom!

539
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,400
Elias?

540
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,480
Can you hear me?

541
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,600
Listen.

542
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,480
You're right. Don't open the door.
No matter what, you're safe in there.

543
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,360
We'll make it. I promise.

544
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,160
Her bag.

545
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,200
Throw it over to me.

546
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,760
Now!

547
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,640
Here, here. It's all right. Okay?

548
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,360
She was dead, God damn it. How could she...

549
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:44,760
"Sunrise, 7:14. Sunset, 5:26."

550
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,960
- Where the fuck were you?
- "Blood, 150 ml."

551
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,040
She's a vampire.

552
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,600
What have you been smoking?
You psychotic freak.

553
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,680
She tore his throat open, man.
I saw it!

554
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,720
You shut the fuck up!
The fuck is wrong with you? Huh?

555
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,920
What about Jurij?

556
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,056
- What about him?
- That was no dog.

557
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,160
You outta your mind?

558
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,920
- You gonna listen to this fucking maniac?
- Man, lay off it, Karl.

559
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,840
- You know what he did in Mali.
- Yeah, I know what he did.

560
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,400
So?

561
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,520
You wanna believe this...

562
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,960
sick, twisted fuck of a maniac?

563
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,040
Huh?

564
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,760
She wants to get away
from the sun.

565
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,160
Let's give her some.

566
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,920
Your baby's been crying
for two hours. Is everything all right?

567
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,600
I'm here.

568
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:53,480
Shush.

569
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,040
I was hoping you'd come back here.

570
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,760
You killed my son. Do you know that?

571
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,440
He bit me.

572
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,120
He had no control over it.

573
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,240
But you do?

574
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:44,040
No one does. The evil is too strong.

575
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,840
We are all cursed.

576
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,800
We bring nothing
but suffering to this world.

577
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,480
We got one more detonator.
We could blast the door down.

578
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:08,560
Go back up there?
Forget that damn mission, man!

579
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,720
Berg is dead.

580
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,720
He was the only one
who knew what was going on anyways.

581
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,840
We got our advances, come on.
Isn't that enough?

582
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,440
You wanna jump out
in the middle of the ocean?

583
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,520
Get a fucking grip.
What's the matter with you?

584
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:25,280
Our only chance is you go up there
and get the plane back on course.

585
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,800
Yeah?

586
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,600
Man up!

587
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,920
No! No, stay here!

588
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,080
Fuck!

589
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,040
Mama!

590
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,520
Come back inside.
They'll be back!

591
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:03,720
Elias.

592
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,000
Go back.

593
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,760
I won't leave you alone.

594
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,080
Come! Hurry up! Let's go!

595
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,280
Help me!

596
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,480
Wait!

597
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,520
- Hide. Get in there.
- Wait! Mom, wait!

598
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,160
Get in there.

599
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,920
What the fuck?

600
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:03,680
Come on!

601
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,880
- I'm going to shoot her.
- Don't shoot.

602
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,120
Come on.

603
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,320
Come.

604
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:20,760
Hello.

605
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,760
Take the controls.

606
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,320
- Move, Karl! Go!
- Do it!

607
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,840
- Come on!
- Who's in there? Come on, open!

608
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,880
There's no deity but God.
Muhammad is the messenger of God.

609
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,080
Don't.

610
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:47,640
Don't.

611
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,040
Don't.

612
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,720
Leave her alone!

613
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,680
I have to kill your mama.

614
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,480
- She's evil.
- You're the evil one!

615
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:24,920
Don't move!

616
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,760
Can you do that?

617
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,640
Don't move!

618
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,640
Can you shoot someone?

619
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,040
Elias.

620
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,600
Elias.

621
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:55,120
- What the fuck is that? What?
- It's a pressure drop! A pressure drop!

622
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,960
We only got oxygen for ten more minutes.

623
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,480
Huh?

624
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,200
We got to get the plane down.

625
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,360
Give me a mask.

626
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:40,800
Give me your mask.

627
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:42,920
Give me. Fuck off!

628
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:48,760
Go. Go!

629
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,880
- I've got to get into that cockpit.
- Do it! Fucking do it now!

630
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,200
It's open!

631
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:20,760
Come on.

632
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,760
There's an oxygen mask down there.

633
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:30,360
Elias.

634
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,040
Elias.

635
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,320
Okay, guys. We're going down!

636
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,120
No!

637
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:50,000
Oh.

638
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:54,960
Ah.

639
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:56,960
<i>We are cursed.</i>

640
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:01,280
<i>We cannot allow this evil
to keep spreading.</i>

641
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:16,400
This evil cannot keep spreading.

642
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,800
We have to stop it.

643
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:29,120
You have the evil within.

644
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,760
You cannot...

645
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:33,920
control it.

646
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,560
Everything okay?

647
01:15:58,160 --> 01:15:59,760
- I wanna see my mom.
- No.

648
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,480
Elias, stay here.

649
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,800
- Okay, we're back on course.
- Good shit!

650
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,320
Fire in the hold!

651
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,440
- What?
- There's a fire in the hold.

652
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,680
Fuck!

653
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,280
Eightball, where the fuck are you?

654
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,000
What the fuck!

655
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,040
Fuck.

656
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,320
- Rainer!
- Out of the way!

657
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,720
We got to get out of here. Now.

658
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:25,480
Mama!

659
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:28,080
Elias!

660
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,240
- Mama!
- Elias, stay here!

661
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:43,800
It's Eightball.

662
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:45,880
He's alive.

663
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,920
- What is it?
- Shush.

664
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,120
What...

665
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,160
Ah.

666
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,720
Ah!

667
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,840
Let's get out!

668
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,840
We need help!

669
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:25,560
We need help!

670
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:30,920
What the fuck!

671
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,520
Did he bite you?

672
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,240
Did he bite you?

673
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,320
Help me! Help!

674
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,120
Fuck you! Fucking bullshit! Where are you?

675
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,000
Help! Help, I cannot...

676
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,120
Ingelore?

677
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:00,560
Ingelore?

678
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:05,920
Ingelore, where are you?
I'm looking for my wife.

679
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,080
Give it to me.

680
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:09,760
Out of the way!

681
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,400
What's going on back there?
You goddamn terrorist!

682
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,720
- Stop it. You're not helping.
- Let me through!

683
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:19,160
Let me through!

684
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,120
Cut the shit out!

685
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,120
- My wife, I need to find her.
- Where is she?

686
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,560
The monster got her!

687
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,160
She's not a monster!

688
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:27,760
Calm down. I can help.
I used to be in the army, understand?

689
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:28,760
Huh.

690
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:31,360
Everyone, whatever is back there,
we got to keep our heads.

691
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,280
Yeah? Search the floor.

692
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,600
Find whatever we can use
to defend ourselves.

693
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:51,120
You ugly motherfucker.

694
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,800
- Hey, what about this?
- Give it to me! Here!

695
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,160
- Pardon! Pass it down!
- Yes.

696
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:19,040
Hey, stop! Wait here!

697
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,240
- Hey, hey, you can't do that.
- Hey!

698
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:24,480
Hey, kid, what's up with your mother?

699
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,760
- She doesn't have leukemia.
- I never said that.

700
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:30,160
- Don't hurt her, please.
- I won't, I promise. What's her name?

701
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:32,840
- Nadja.
- Okay. You stay here. Watch him.

702
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,280
Sure.

703
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:38,680
Mama, watch out!
They wanna kill you!

704
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,400
Mama! Can you hear me?

705
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:43,320
They wanna kill you!

706
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,040
Help me.

707
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,200
Nadja? Can you hear me?

708
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:01,480
- Elias sent me. We don't want to hurt you!
- Ingelore.

709
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:02,880
Ingelore!

710
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,000
Ingelore!

711
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,760
Ingelore. What happened to you?

712
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:09,000
Oh God.

713
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,640
No, no, no. This can't be.

714
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,040
Oh God.

715
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,120
No!

716
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:35,760
Give it to me. Come on.

717
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,440
- Wait, hold on.
- You killed my wife!

718
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,120
I'll shoot you.

719
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:43,680
We need to help him!

720
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,480
Don't! Stay here! Stop him!

721
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,640
Fucking help!

722
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:01,000
Hit her!

723
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:11,360
Mom!

724
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:13,840
Don't do it!

725
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,800
No!

726
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,800
Don't shoot!

727
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:54,800
Elias, we can't let them come up.

728
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,400
You have to help her!

729
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:32,560
He bit me.

730
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:34,960
I can't feel my fingers!

731
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,200
Shit. Shit.

732
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:54,400
What the fuck?

733
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:03,640
Okay, okay.

734
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:15,000
Stay here.

735
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:19,520
Oh my God.
Elias! Elias! Get some help, quick!

736
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:21,600
Quick!

737
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:38,680
Help me!

738
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:42,200
We need heavy people
to weigh down the hatch!

739
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:45,680
What did he say?

740
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:47,080
What do you want?

741
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,320
Help me! Help!

742
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:27,120
Help! help! Fuck!

743
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,080
No!

744
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,640
Stop! Don't bite him!

745
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,680
Stop! Go away! Don't drink his blood!

746
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,160
What the fuck?

747
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:38,320
Elias.

748
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,040
Elias, get back. He's dangerous.

749
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,320
He wants to be healed, just like you!

750
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,240
- Don't!
- Keep calm, Elias!

751
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:48,920
Right here.

752
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:06,560
My hand got caught in the cargo hold door.

753
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,800
And your mom helped me.

754
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:11,120
Come.

755
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,640
Elias. Let's go.

756
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:18,320
We need a doctor.

757
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,760
We need a doctor!

758
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,240
I'm a doctor!

759
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,040
No, it's not about me.
There's a guy in the rear who's worse off.

760
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,520
Don't worry. She's on our side!

761
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:37,720
We got everything under control!
Don't worry!

762
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,280
Turn the plane around.

763
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,200
- Do it!
- I have to check our course.

764
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,120
- We're below cruising altitude.
- Mom.

765
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,040
- Mom.
- What's going on?

766
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:56,120
She wants us to fly to New York.
But we're too low and short on fuel.

767
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:59,120
We have to divert to the nearest airport,
or we'll crash into the ocean.

768
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:02,320
- Turn the plane!
- Hey, we can't make it to New York.

769
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,400
Do you understand?

770
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:06,440
You got to help me.

771
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,240
Please, help me. I'll pay you.

772
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,840
Don't worry. I'll help you.

773
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,920
It's dark down there.

774
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,160
Come on. Let's go.

775
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:33,400
This is Transatlantic 473.

776
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:35,160
Do you read me?

777
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,720
Transatlantic 473.

778
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,000
Anybody read me?

779
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:47,560
They wanted to blow down the door.

780
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,880
Watch out, it's on!

781
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:51,560
Not anymore.

782
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:56,560
It's gonna be fine. We'll wait until dark
and catch the next plane to New York.

783
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:00,640
Mom, look how far we've come.

784
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:02,440
Mom!

785
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:04,480
Please, we can do it.

786
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:31,920
Thank you.

787
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:35,960
Thank you, guys.

788
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:42,400
If the pain gets worse,
take two more pills.

789
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:46,240
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay. I take care of the broker.

790
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:47,160
How is he?

791
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,520
He has massive interior bleeding.

792
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:52,400
<i>This is Lossiemouth tower.</i>

793
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:56,000
<i>You've left your assigned course.
Please identify yourself immediately.</i>

794
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:00,560
<i>This airplane is now
under our control.</i>

795
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:03,080
<i>We are faithful soldiers of the Caliphate,</i>

796
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:05,280
<i>who have abandoned this life to stri...</i>

797
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:11,160
This is Transatlantic 473.
Transatlantic 473.

798
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:14,160
I am the second officer.
My name is Bastian Buchner.

799
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,040
We have been hijacked.
The captain is dead.

800
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,480
<i>Transatlantic 473, please repeat.</i>

801
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:22,040
I said we have been hijacked.
The captain is dead.

802
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:23,920
<i>Are you in danger?</i>

803
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:29,960
Negative. We overpowered the hijackers,
and we locked them in the cargo hold.

804
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,840
I'm so cold.

805
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:57,560
You've got a kidney rupture.
I can't stop the bleeding.

806
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:01,120
What does this mean?

807
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:05,000
- I'll get you something for the pain.
- Stay here.

808
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:07,760
You've got to help me.

809
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:10,960
I'll pay you.

810
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,400
A million dollars.

811
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,560
Your money isn't going
to help you now either.

812
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:19,720
I'm sorry.

813
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:24,680
She'll be right back.

814
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,240
Fuck.

815
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,440
Don't worry. He's not going to get up.

816
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:01,160
Bite me.

817
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:03,920
Please.

818
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:08,040
I don't want to die.

819
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:23,120
Perfect. I'll give you the address
as soon as we land.

820
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:24,320
Goodbye.

821
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:27,240
Dr. Brown will make sure
to get the Cytarabine.

822
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:29,720
That way we'll have enough time
to plan the next flight.

823
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:43,440
Shit.

824
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:46,760
Fuck!

825
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,800
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. Something's wrong.

826
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:56,280
- Bastian!
- What's wrong?

827
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,080
Go down. Go.

828
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:00,000
Wait, I'll help you.

829
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,120
Hey, what are you doing?

830
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,760
We can help them!
We can hide them down there!

831
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:10,360
If we open the door,
then we'll never get it shut again.

832
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:11,440
Fuck!

833
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:17,200
Let us in! Please, let us in!

834
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,360
Please.

835
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:24,000
Please, we're gonna die out here!
Please let us in!

836
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:26,920
We can't land.

837
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,360
What do you mean it shouldn't land?
You wanna crash the plane or what?

838
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:34,440
They'll hide in the cargo bay
till it's dark, then get out, all of them.

839
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:36,240
We have to inform the authorities.

840
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,920
What? And tell them what?
We have vampires on board?

841
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,600
No, no, no, we have to...

842
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:42,880
We have to land and then jump.

843
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:46,960
Here. If we attach this to the fuel tank,

844
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:49,000
it'll be enough
to blow up the whole plane.

845
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:50,160
How do we get there?

846
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,160
- That's the fuel tank.
- Fuck. Shit.

847
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:58,720
What?

848
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,600
The detonator doesn't have a timer.
Do you have a remote?

849
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:03,736
- Yeah. Curtiz had it.
- Where is it?

850
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:07,240
- Where is that asshole? Fuck.
- In the rear cargo hold.

851
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:10,080
Okay.

852
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:13,920
- Does this lead to the back?
- Yeah.

853
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:15,520
Man!

854
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:20,880
Shit, it's way too narrow.

855
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:24,520
Is there another way to detonate it?

856
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,640
Yeah, but then we'll blow up too.

857
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:31,120
You land the plane.

858
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,600
And as soon as you're out,

859
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:35,720
I'll blow it up.

860
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:36,840
No, Mama!

861
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:39,640
- Yes, Elias.
- We can get you out of here.

862
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:43,200
- You can hide in here.
- Elias, we have no other choice.

863
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:44,120
Okay?

864
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:47,120
- I can fit there. I can get the remote.
- Elias, it's over!

865
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:48,520
You hear me?

866
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:56,480
- Forgive me, please.
- I can get past them with this.

867
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,320
Give me...

868
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:03,320
Stay here, Elias! Shit!

869
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:06,800
Fuck.

870
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:46,120
No! That's suicide!

871
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:49,960
He'll make it. Look, he'll make it.

872
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:53,200
Look.

873
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,480
That's the remote control.

874
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,400
Elias, can you hear me?

875
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:39,760
<i>The cell phone is the remote control.</i>

876
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:43,840
Be careful. Don't press the big button.

877
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:47,480
Elias, come back.
Elias, you hear me? Come back.

878
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:48,960
<i>Elias, run!</i>

879
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:02,480
Shit!

880
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,840
How hard is it to land the plane?

881
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:22,800
What? Why? We'll make it.

882
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:26,360
I entered the coordinates. We'll fly
to the destination automatically.

883
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,120
And the landing?

884
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:30,760
You have to stay in the air corridor
then put on the brakes.

885
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:32,080
The rest is no problem.

886
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,400
- Can you handle it?
- What?

887
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:37,960
Anyone can do this
with contact to ground station,

888
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:39,280
even with one hand.

889
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,520
You have to look after my son.

890
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:45,120
What do you mean?

891
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:47,160
Please, just promise me.

892
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,280
I promise.

893
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:56,600
- Hey, what are you doing?
- No!

894
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,080
Mama!

895
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:11,960
Go away!

896
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:13,600
Mama!

897
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:28,200
Go away!

898
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:31,680
Mama!

899
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:50,400
No!

900
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:10,640
Hey! Come on!

901
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:13,240
Come on!

902
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:15,280
Come on!

903
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:18,960
Come and get me!

904
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,760
Mama! Mama!

905
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:06,160
<i>Transatlantic 473,
Transatlantic 473, please respond.</i>

906
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:07,120
Hello?

907
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:11,360
<i>Who am I speaking to?</i>

908
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:13,720
<i>What's going on?
Where's the copilot?</i>

909
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:15,120
Copilot is dead.

910
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:16,680
<i>Please repeat.</i>

911
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:19,240
- He's dead.
<i>- What happened?</i>

912
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:20,880
<i>Hello?</i>

913
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:24,760
<i>Transatlantic 473, do you copy?
What the fuck happened?</i>

914
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:27,560
No. Elias.

915
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:33,040
- Elias, watch out! Behind you!
- Mama!

916
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:34,360
Talk to me, please!

917
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:42,600
Shit!

918
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:52,760
Autopilot.  Autopilot.

919
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:54,520
<i>Autopilot switched off.</i>

920
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:59,800
No! Go away!

921
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:05,680
Go!

922
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:19,440
Fuck.

923
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:26,640
Mama.

924
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:28,960
Stay with me.

925
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:58,200
Mama!

926
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:35,800
Where's Farid?

927
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:37,320
You mean Farid al Adwa?

928
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:40,480
He's still on the plane.
The police have him under control.

929
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:43,680
- You have to get him out of there.
- I don't know what Farid told you.

930
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:45,200
But he's one of the bad guys.

931
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:47,200
No, you have to get Farid out of there.

932
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,336
- You have to save him from the vampires.
- Calm down.

933
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:51,120
- The plane is full of them.
- What happened?

934
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:54,080
- You have to get Farid out before sunset.
- Calm down, boy.

935
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:55,520
We need your help.

936
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:58,560
Can you tell me
how many kidnappers there are?

937
01:44:58,640 --> 01:44:59,480
They're all dead!

938
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:01,720
- What do you mean?
- They are all monsters!

939
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:05,400
You have to get Farid out of there
before the sun goes down!

940
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:09,120
- No! No! Stop it!
- Shush. Calm down.

941
01:45:09,640 --> 01:45:12,160
- Let me go!
- It'll all be fine.

942
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,080
Let go of me!

943
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,520
Let...

944
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:18,800
You have to...

945
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:20,480
save...

946
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:21,920
Farid.

947
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:27,160
The kid's in shock.

948
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:29,920
What are your orders, Commander?

949
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:37,480
We wait.

950
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:14,640
<i>The convention you claim
to be going to doesn't exist. We checked.</i>

951
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:19,080
They... They planned it all that way,
those bastards!

952
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:21,080
Don't you understand?

953
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:24,280
You have to let me get out of here.

954
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:25,800
Now!

955
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:28,440
<i>Or it will be too late.</i>

956
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,680
That is one tough bastard.

957
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:35,040
I wouldn't expect him to last that long
with an injury like that.

958
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:37,160
Let the passengers go,

959
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:40,360
have your men hand themselves over,
and then we'll let you out.

960
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:43,480
I'm not holding anyone!
Don't you understand?

961
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:50,600
Oh Lord of the worlds.

962
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:54,000
Let me out. They're going to kill us all.

963
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:04,920
Shoot to kill. The target has a detonator.

964
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:10,360
- Did you get him?
<i>- Don't know, sir.</i>

965
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:12,440
To all units, operation is ongoing.

966
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:38,560
Go, go, go, go.

967
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:06,520
Don't move! Don't fucking move!

968
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:09,160
Raise your hands!

969
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:10,720
No, no, no!

970
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:12,280
Please, please, listen to me!

971
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:14,840
No, I have to blow up the airplane.
I don't want to, but...

972
01:48:34,840 --> 01:48:37,280
Come on. Let's move!
They're taking the plane.

973
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:39,760
All right.
We're bringing him to the hospital.

974
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:43,560
You have to get Farid out of there!
Where's my teddy?

01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:44,840
Where's my teddy?

976
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:46,680
- Here, give it to him.
- My bear!

977
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:48,400
Calm down. Calm down.

978
01:48:56,920 --> 01:48:58,600
You've got to stop them!

979
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:00,280
They can't go into the plane!

980
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:01,800
All right, lad.

981
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:15,800
<i>Oh fuck!</i>

982
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:19,440
- What the hell?
- It's a fucking bloodbath.

983
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:21,520
- What's going on?
- First team, respond.

984
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:33,960
Let's go! Get the boy!

985
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:38,240
Stop!

986
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:47,720
- Jesus Christ, what's going on?
<i>- Blood everywhere!</i>

987
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,640
Stay here! Fuck.

988
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:57,000
No, no, don't do it. Please!
The whole airplane is full of...

989
01:49:57,080 --> 01:49:59,160
Ah, please...

990
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:00,680
Don't do it! It's full...

991
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:02,760
- The airplane...
- Get out here!

992
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:05,760
Don't go in there!
The whole airplane is full of monsters.

993
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:07,760
Please, don't. Fuck!

994
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:14,200
Farid!

995
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:16,320
Elias?

996
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:19,080
Elias! Elias!

997
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:21,000
Elias! I'm here!

998
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:22,920
- I'm here! I'm here!
- Farid!

999
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:46,600
Jesus Christ! What was that?

1000
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:49,040
Farid!

1001
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:54,000
Farid!

1002
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:56,960
Farid!

1003
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:08,520
Mama?

1004
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:18,360
Mama!

1005
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:35,440
No!

1006
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:38,560
Let me go! The boy is with me.

1007
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:50,200
Elias!

1008
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:55,920
Elias!

1009
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:01,880
Elias.

1010
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:06,160
Elias!

1011
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:10,600
Elias!

1012
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:13,760
Elias!

1013
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:17,720
Elias.

1014
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,640
Uncuff him. Let him go.

1015
01:52:47,305 --> 01:53:47,731
