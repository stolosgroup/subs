2
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:44,544
What bothers me,

3
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:46,713
is to hear all day

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,923
that lots of single guys want to settle down.

5
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,426
Excuse me, but I've been looking for six months.

6
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,261
Well, it's a desert.

7
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,264
I tried everything!

8
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:58,057
I go out in the evenings.

9
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,684
By myself of course,

10
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,186
but that's not that bad.
-Stop it!

11
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,856
I went on a singles cruise.

12
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:07,900
But I don't have the stomach for sea travel

13
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,193
and I was seasick for a week.

14
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,738
I registered on dating websites,

15
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,157
every single one.
But there are only idiots there!

16
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,283
So...

17
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,702
Excuse me...
A small duck liver

18
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,912
with pear on a bed of lettuce.

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,872
Thank you.

20
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,791
I've been to "Speed-Dating", "Blind Date",

21
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,501
"Speed Blind Date"

22
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:26,961
housewarming parties...

23
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,005
Since when do we invite strangers for Christmas?

24
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:31,549
She's Coco's new boss.
A very important publisher.

25
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:34,135
And?
-She was alone tonight...

26
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:36,387
She's unbearable!
-I know.

27
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:39,265
Another resolution was...

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,226
I went to see a make-up artist
who suggested a new haircut.

29
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,062
My hairdresser, Francis,

30
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,315
chose to do highlights and a volume treatment.

31
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,777
I wanted to show my face.

32
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,069
And it worked, right?

33
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,197
She should keep her mouth closed instead.

34
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,991
I haven't met anyone yet,

35
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:58,743
but I don't care...

36
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:02,997
because what matters is
the attempt of having looked for someone.

37
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:06,334
And since my divorce...

38
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,922
I've been better than ever.

39
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:22,475
Leave her, honey.

40
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,477
Cry, let it out.

41
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,771
I'm so sorry.

42
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,524
I'm ruining Christmas Eve for you.

43
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,150
Not at all.
-Are you kidding?

44
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,194
You're getting on my nerves.

45
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:34,445
Mom!

46
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,155
Well, she's a nightmare.

47
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,032
She's recently divorced.

48
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,410
Yes, she mentioned that five times.
But what's her problem?

49
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,246
My problem is,

50
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,539
that I'm 36.

51
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,292
The love of my life dumped me like trash.

52
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,253
I can't stand it!

53
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,921
I don't meet anyone.

54
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,005
Nobody!

55
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,842
Just idiots that want to hump me.
-Mind your language!

56
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:58,511
Dad, what does "hump" mean?

57
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:59,470
Sorry.

58
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:00,847
To hump someone,

59
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,057
it's like cuddling, but harder.

60
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,475
What's hard?

61
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,478
I'll explain later.

62
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:10,064
I'll never meet anyone.

63
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,899
I'll end up alone.

64
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,734
Well, Véronique...

65
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,069
Valérie...

66
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,654
Yes, whatever.

67
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,865
Let me tell you a story.

68
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:19,991
Not again,

69
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,451
the same old story!
-Please...

70
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,704
I'll go sit on the sofa.
-You stay here!

71
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,249
Valérie...

72
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,627
No woman in our family

73
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,130
has had luck with the first marriage.

74
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,507
It's our curse.

75
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,385
More like a twist of fate.
-A curse!

76
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,429
I don't quite know when it started.

77
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:44,181
In 1884, with my great-grandmother Adèle.

78
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,767
My grandmothers, my aunts, my cousins

79
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,311
all had to remarry

80
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,520
to be happy.

81
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,105
I will have a divorce too.

82
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,190
Of course!

83
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,483
Don't say that!

84
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,819
But it's true.

85
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,196
For us, the first is never good.

86
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:00,656
Valérie...

87
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:01,908
I'm the second.

88
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:03,534
And grandpa too.

89
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:04,619
Yes.

90
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,248
There was one who wanted to avoid it.

91
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,583
Isabelle.

92
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,043
Who's Isabelle?

93
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,628
My older sister.

94
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,922
It began ten years ago.

95
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,841
She met Pierre during the final year

96
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,593
of her dentistry studies.

97
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,012
He was her tutor.

98
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,555
Tall and hadsome...

99
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:32,229
Soon,

100
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,815
he becomes her private tutor.

101
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,405
Soon, she moves into his apartment.

102
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,533
And it quickly becomes their apartment.

103
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,411
They work together.

104
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,621
Open wide.

105
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,706
In fact, they do everything together.

106
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,000
And for ten years, every week is the same.

107
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,794
Brunch on Sunday.

108
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:55,920
Isa, your foot!

109
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,546
Bowling on Monday.

110
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,051
Eating at the "Les Milles Saveurs" restaurant on Tuesday.

111
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,886
Veal chop? Sea bass?

112
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,137
Thank you, Pascal.

113
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,138
On Wednesday,

114
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:06,931
Pictionary.

115
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,557
A club chair!
-Yes!

116
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:11,769
On Thursday morning,

117
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,145
it's tennis.

118
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,147
And on Friday...

119
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,358
I'll skip the details.

120
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:23,823
Go on, Coco.

121
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:25,616
In short,

122
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,284
Pierre was the one.

123
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,203
But he was the first.

124
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,204
So she decided

125
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,081
not to get married.

126
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,249
Isa is smart!

127
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,500
In her own way,

128
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,545
she managed to advert the curse.
-But something was missing

129
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,255
for perfect happiness.

130
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:42,591
At first, not having kids seemed fine.

131
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,261
But at some point it went astray.

132
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,262
What are you doing?

133
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:47,763
Sorry.

134
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,599
Within a few months it became an obsession.

135
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,810
She was constantly thinking about it.

136
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,814
Even when she wasn't,
her biological clock kept reminding her.

137
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,774
I'm going shopping.

138
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,740
Everything okay?

139
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,033
Yes, great.

140
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,711
You know, many unmarried couples have children.

141
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,297
Listen,

142
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:25,176
for my mother, we already live in a mortal sin.
Our kid would be the devil's child.

143
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,138
She would sprinkle it with holy water,
whenever she'd see it.

144
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,432
Imagine the baby having to wear a raincoat.

145
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,936
In our family it's always
marriage first, then children.

146
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,272
You only need to do one thing,

147
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,608
marry me.

148
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,777
You know I can't.

149
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,947
Excuse me.

150
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,158
This went on for a while.

151
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,118
But one day she gave in.

152
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,789
We've known and loved each other for ten years.

153
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,458
Nothing will happen to us.

154
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,463
A modest, quick wedding and that's it.

155
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:04,632
Everything will be fine.

156
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:07,802
Since when do you smoke?

157
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,387
Since now.

158
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,644
What's wrong with me?

159
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,106
You were so happy.

160
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,149
You found the flaw.

161
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,567
I know,

162
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,194
but I want to have children with Pierre.

163
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,030
Being a single mom isn't that bad either.

164
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,573
Mom!

165
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,673
Hi, mate.

166
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,466
How can you say "yes"

167
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,009
when you know how it ends?

168
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,304
Don't tell me you believe
in these superstitions?

169
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,141
No, but I'm glad I'm the second.

170
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,730
Will "Vertigo of love" be played at the wedding?

171
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,775
Please don't be mad, but we'll have a DJ.
-Out of the question.

172
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,239
Music is my thing.

173
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,163
And that did it.

174
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,164
But...

175
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,250
I don't understand,
what the DJ has to do with the story...

176
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,461
Stop with this anecdote, nobody cares!

177
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,716
A story has many facets, like a prism...
-Facets.

178
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,384
Farah Fawcett.
-Brigitte Fosset.

179
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,011
Nope. You lose!

180
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:34,555
Now, where was I?

181
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,140
Stimorol.
-Oh yes.

182
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,141
You know, in Denmark,

183
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,643
one can get married
and have a divorce 10 minutes later.

184
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,146
The plan was,

185
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:44,190
express marriage and immediate divorce.

186
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,983
We called it

187
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,359
"Operation Stimorol".

188
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:11,383
There you are!

189
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,011
Landing in Kopenhagen at 9:53.

190
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,722
Lars von Anderson, a student,
will be expecting you.

191
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,058
He says "yes" at 11:00.

192
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,060
At 11:30, divorce.

193
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,270
Return to Paris at 15:00 and
you're available for Pierre.

194
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,897
Is this risky?
-No.

195
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,775
I lied to Pierre, I hate myself.

196
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,068
What have you told him?

197
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:32,238
The first thing that crossed my mind.
That you're depressed

198
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,658
and I'm accompanying you to
a spiritual retreat.

199
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,993
That's what crossed your mind first?

200
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,745
I know...

201
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,039
We're neighbours! What if he comes by?

202
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,540
You'll come up with something.

203
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,126
Take this.
-What is it?

204
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,337
It's for the snowstorm in Kopenhagen.

205
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,215
Oh no.
-Bye.

206
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,051
I have fear of flying.

207
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,359
I'm not Danish.
-Sorry.

208
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:13,112
You're in my seat.
-Oh, yes.

209
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:16,115
The flight attendant said I should check with you...

210
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,951
I have a horrible fear of flying,
and it helps me

211
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,703
when I see what's happening outside.

212
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,579
I understand.

213
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,498
Thank you, very kind of you.

214
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,584
Yes?

215
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,461
I'm waiting for my seat.

216
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,301
Don't worry, if we crash,

217
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,637
it hurts equally regardless of where you sit.

218
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,097
You know...

219
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,999
It's more likely to get killed when getting
a loaf of bread that in an airplane.

220
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,644
However...

221
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:49,523
I don't allow myself to be afraid of flying,
because I travel all the time.

222
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,942
I work for Routard.

223
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:52,985
The guidebook.

224
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:54,361
I know it.

225
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,897
Jean-Yves Berthier.
My friends call me "Gum".

226
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,032
Hello.

227
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,910
Are you going to Denmark?

228
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,787
Yes, like the rest of us on this flight.

229
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,332
No, I'm flying to Kenya. Nairobi.

230
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,209
Crap, I forgot something in my bag.

231
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,299
You must be wondering, why I'm here, right?

232
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,217
Yes.

233
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,846
I save 280 Euros with a stopover in Kopenhagen.

234
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,097
System R.

235
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,432
R as resourceful.

236
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,343
Do you know what you can do
with 280 Euros in Kenya?

237
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,271
No idea.
-Everything, absolutely everything.

238
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,691
Do you know what I do with it?
Nothing!

239
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,903
Nothing, because I'm responsible.

240
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,446
What will you do in Denmark?

241
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,699
I'll marry a Dane I don't know.

242
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,451
It will cost me 5000 Euros.

243
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,747
If you don't mind,
I'd like to relax now.

244
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,040
A white marriage?

245
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,958
Congratulations! Not bad.

246
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,960
I won't tell anyone.

247
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,422
Marriage is no longer what it used to be.

248
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,217
When I think of my parents...

249
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,999
Do you know how long my father
waited before asking for my mothers hand?

250
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,973
24 hours.

251
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,602
They were married for 70 years.

252
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,938
<i>Jean-Yves, pull yourself together!<i/></i>

253
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,773
I'm the same.

254
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:16,068
If I find the right one,
I'll marry her on the spot.

255
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:18,779
And you?

256
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,323
What makes you think, I want to talk?

257
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,658
Honestly.

258
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,451
The headphones, the mask...

259
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,372
Sorry.

260
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,895
Louise, you understood, right?

261
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:55,023
What do you say to uncle Pierre?
-That you're here.

262
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,191
No.

263
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,734
You tell him that I'm not here!

264
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,154
When you see him,

265
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,447
what do you say?

266
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,782
That I have to say you're not here.

267
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,817
She doesn't get anything!

268
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,330
This is great.

269
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,134
Who is it?

270
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,595
Coco, I found...
What?

271
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,389
What's wrong?

272
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,393
Are you with someone?

273
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:32,269
Not at all.

274
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,646
Pierre, perfect timing.

275
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,941
I'm working on the
music for the wedding.

276
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,360
The selection is complex.

277
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,030
We'll start with oriental music by Enrico Macias,

278
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,782
then comes the disco part,

279
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,576
a Boney M. medley.
What do you think?

280
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:49,536
Yes.

281
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,663
Isa told me about Corinne.

282
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,457
It's not too bad, is it?

283
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:54,833
What do you mean?

284
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,252
Her depression. You can tell me.

285
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,420
Right.

286
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,964
It's unbelievable.

287
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,550
I'm here if you need me.

288
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,845
How are you holding up,
with kids and everything?

289
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,847
Not too bad, Nickel is at school,

290
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,390
therefore...

291
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,683
But it's Sunday.

292
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,102
Yes, it's Sunday.

293
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,103
It's Sunday...

294
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,897
...Michèle Torr...

295
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,609
She's taking remedial courses.

296
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,445
She's not too bright.

297
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,032
But you know what?

298
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:30,244
It's no big deal.

299
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,872
Sit, let's have a coffee.

300
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,791
Okay? Here we go!

301
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,421
Yes, Isa?

302
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,839
He didn't come?

303
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,050
He stood me up.

304
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,844
I can only reach his voicemail.

305
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:51,265
I've been waiting for five hours.
Your plain is great!

306
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,724
What will you do now?

307
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,935
What can I do? I'm coming home.

308
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,520
No, you're almost there!

309
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,981
You will see this through!

310
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,149
But how?

311
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,359
No idea.

312
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,528
Be creative. Surprise me!

313
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,238
You're funny.
-Look around you.

314
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,155
It can't be

315
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,908
that difficult, finding a single man.

316
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,486
Grab the first available moron
and marry him.

317
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,497
<i>Marriage...</i>

318
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:19,126
<i>If I find the right one,
I'll marry her on the spot.</i>

319
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,211
<i>And you?</i>

320
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,012
I speak French.
-Great.

321
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,264
Tell me, are there churches in Kenya?

322
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:33,974
Yes, of course.

323
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,685
Then I'd like to take the next flight to Nairobi.

324
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,811
Very well.

325
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,188
I save 280 Euros

326
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:42,899
with a stopover, right?

327
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:43,734
No.

328
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,028
But I have a seat in Business Class

329
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,029
for 3200 Euros.

330
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,593
Thank you.

331
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:11,887
What are you doing here?

332
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:13,930
I could ask you the same thing.

333
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,558
I'm flying to Nairobi.

334
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,436
Are you no longer marrying a Dane?

335
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,522
That was a joke.

336
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,232
I was under the impression

337
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,276
you were following me.

338
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,820
No, absolutely not.

339
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,822
Excuse me, you must find me terrible.

340
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:32,407
Yes, I do.

341
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,494
I'll make it up to you.

342
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,213
How's that?

343
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,760
This happens to me all the time.

344
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,887
I was upgraded again.

345
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,691
Thank you.
-You're welcome.

346
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,389
How's it going?

347
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,350
Having a nice flight?
-Fantastic.

348
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,185
I'm glad.

349
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,355
I'd like to apologise about earlier.

350
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:46,606
I'm listening.

351
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:48,692
What?

352
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,944
You'd like to apologise. Go on.

353
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,614
I apologise...

354
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,782
It's not that difficult, damnit!

355
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,244
You want to apologise.
So apologise already!

356
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,787
Relax. You're not the only one
who can be unpleasant.

357
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:12,340
It was a joke.
-Right.

358
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,801
Delightful!

359
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,137
Really delightful.

360
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,184
Will this be your first time in Kenya?

361
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,518
Are you kidding?

362
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,905
At least the fourth time this year already.

363
00:18:26,954 --> 00:18:29,191
And I really need it right now.

364
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,026
It's my oxygen.

365
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,487
Speaking of oxygen, for diving...

366
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,489
It's because I'm single.

367
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,617
I just broke up with my boyfriend.

368
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:40,994
The good news is...

369
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,746
I'm alone.

370
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:44,456
Completely free.

371
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,459
Rather alone than in bad company.

372
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,044
Oh no.

373
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,963
Rather in good company than alone.

374
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,090
No, rather alone than

375
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,717
in bad company.

376
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,010
As you wish.

377
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,929
You confused me...

378
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,516
No. Rather alone than...

379
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,102
Yes, yes, immediately.

380
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:07,896
Alright.

381
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:08,939
Thank you.

382
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:14,611
Well,

383
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:15,529
see you later.

384
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,979
The lobby already reveals

385
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,440
what Nairobi Serena is.

386
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,693
A discreet hotel with a tropical flair.

387
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,227
Isabelle?

388
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:15,148
Jean-Yves! Unbelievable!
What are you doing here?

389
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,567
Are you sure you're not following me?

390
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,569
Not at all, I...

391
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,821
Is this how you treat women?

392
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,324
First you kiss them and then disappear.

393
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,785
Hang on, you kissed me.

394
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,161
We meet on flight to Kopenhagen,

395
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:30,664
then to Nairobi,

396
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,123
and we end up at the same hotel!

397
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,458
It's crazy!

398
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:35,418
Come.

399
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:38,922
Put your bathrobe on.
I'll meet you at the pool.

400
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,091
No, Isabelle. I can't.

401
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,301
I have to go. I'm already late.

402
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,846
You're not staying at this hotel?
-No, at Zebra Lodge.

403
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,849
Zebra has reopened?

404
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,936
I always used to stay there until it closed down.

405
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:56,815
Wait, I'll cancel my room here, okay?

406
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:57,983
Okay.

407
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:01,528
Hi, how's it going?

408
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,364
Doesn't matter.

409
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,616
Just move your lips like this...

410
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,662
Exactly. Perfect.

411
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:12,831
There are also two restaurants,

412
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:16,126
a bar, a shopping area, a casino...

413
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,878
Done.
-No, no, no. Please!

414
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,171
Golden rule,

415
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,257
dictaphone means silence.

416
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,217
Until I say "over", you mustn't

417
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,636
speak to me. Understood?

418
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,180
So, a casino,

419
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,351
a pool and a wellness centre.
In short,

420
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,521
all the luxury one can expect

421
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,982
at a five star hotel.

422
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,152
I'm sorry, work is work.

423
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,403
I understand.
-What were you saying?

424
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,489
I cancelled my room. Are we going?
-Yes.

425
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:47,991
And your baggage?

426
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,352
No, I know darling,

427
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,563
but I had to leave my mobile phone behind.

428
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,775
The nuns here are very strict.

429
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,195
You too, I miss you.

430
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,572
Hello? Pierre?

431
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,991
Pierre, can you hear me?

432
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,159
Hello?

433
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,121
Yes, I hear you now.

434
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:36,414
No,

435
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:39,292
we're not coming back yet.
Corinne isn't getting any better.

436
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,003
We're staying a while longer.

437
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,592
What?
-Sorry, it's nothing.

438
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,636
Corinne had another panic attack.

439
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:53,765
No, I'll call you again.
Don't call me.

440
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,851
Yes, me too, I love you. Bye.

441
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,366
Oh no!

442
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,415
I have the wrong bag.

443
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,834
Are we going?

444
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,045
Jean-Yves!
-Yes?

445
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:25,213
Have a look.

446
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,138
So?

447
00:24:35,533 --> 00:24:37,183
Yes, um... Well, it's okay.

448
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,144
Another colour?

449
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,479
Yes? Well yes.

450
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:42,981
Yes?

451
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:50,697
It's so hot here!

452
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,826
It really is hot.

453
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:56,703
Unlike Russia.

454
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,246
You're familiar with Russia?

455
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:01,666
Well, if living in Moscow for twelve years

456
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:07,297
being the manager for East Europe,
Baltic and Russia for Routard

457
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,592
means being familiar with Russia,

458
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,178
then yes,

459
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,054
I'm familiar with Russia a bit.

460
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:17,390
And?

461
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:20,676
Here yes, but isn't it a bit too much for outside...

462
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,645
Should I try another one?

463
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,398
Choose one.

464
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,358
Be right back.

465
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,952
You look fantastic.
-Thank you.

466
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,545
So, Jean-Yves.

467
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,464
I want to know everything about you.

468
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:53,259
Well, I'm a Virgo, ascendant in Libra.

469
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:56,137
I cannot stand lies, injustice,

470
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:58,181
prejudice or tobacco.

471
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:00,475
I like sofa beds. They're practical.

472
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,560
I prefer practice over theory.

473
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,729
Many say I'm flirtatious.

474
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:06,731
That is absolutely not true.

475
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,191
I don't care how I look.

476
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,442
Apart from my hair.

477
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,819
I started losing it when I was 18.

478
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,364
I can shamelessly say I have transplants.

479
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,115
That's impossible!

480
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,909
You don't notice it easily.

481
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,203
I have taken two loans for them.

482
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,914
I hate seeing something going to waste.

483
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,333
I prefer coffee arabica over robusta.

484
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:28,962
I also like to dance.
Anything possible. Polka, Russian folk dance...

485
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:32,632
I've even tried lap dance last year.

486
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,592
But that wasn't for me.

487
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,053
A colour? No, many colours.

488
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,222
Orange, ultramarine and beige.

489
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,890
My lucky numbers?

490
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,643
Clearly, 26, 3 and 1000.

491
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:47,146
A book? "Empire of the Ants".
A song? "I Will Survive".

492
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,065
An animal? The centaur.

493
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:52,443
So, now you have Jean-Yves Berthier.

494
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,154
This was very detailed.

495
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:59,575
The good thing about living alone is
you get to know yourself very well.

496
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,953
Almost forgot, I enjoy bowling.

497
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,414
Me too. I love bowling.

498
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:09,294
All of this has given me an appetite.
I'm starving.

499
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,503
Alright.

500
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,926
What a symphony of smells!

501
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,929
Is this the famous "supu"?
-Yes, precisely.

502
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,299
The supu, s-u-p-u,

503
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,727
is the traditional Masai breakfast.

504
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,980
It's a soup prepared from goat's

505
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:29,990
heart, lung, liver

506
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:32,567
and other original ingredients.

507
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,004
I know what you're asking yourself.

508
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:56,132
What's a russophile editor doing in Africa?

509
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,133
Exactly.

510
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,052
I confess everything!

511
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,059
I'm here by coincidence.

512
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:10,229
There's no coincidence, only destiny.

513
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:11,731
No.

514
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:13,941
I'm replacing Guytou,

515
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,027
the one responsible for East Africa.

516
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,863
His yellow fever vaccination was overdue.

517
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,782
He was brought back immediately.

518
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:24,202
It's a suicide, coming here unvaccinated.

519
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:25,995
But of course there's no need to tell you this.

520
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,090
You're already finished!

521
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,008
Well yes, it's delicious.

522
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:42,220
Take the goat's eye.

523
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,138
I feel watched.

524
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:44,847
Come on,

525
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:46,432
no funny business.

526
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,693
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

527
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,670
Sorry.
-Finished? May I continue?

528
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,255
Sure, continue.

529
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:20,425
Her strategy worked.

530
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,884
She had Jean-Yves on the hook,

531
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:24,429
she just had to reel him in.

532
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,348
May I ask you something intimate?

533
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:28,975
Yes, absolutely.

534
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,353
When was your last love affair?

535
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:33,438
Twelve years.

536
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,982
Really? Twelve years ago?

537
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,651
No, I was twelve. Sandrine.

538
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,404
Since then, I had two or three adventures,

539
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,531
but not even that now.

540
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,535
Yes, because we are too demanding,

541
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,745
too uncompromising, too honest.

542
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:52,540
That's exactly it.

543
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,751
And you?

544
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,044
Me?

545
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,380
Nothing, noone, I'm single.

546
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:02,008
However, I'm troubled by someone recently.

547
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,801
Since when?

548
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,511
Since this morning.

549
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,474
How's that?
-A church!

550
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,685
It's the nicest one in the city.
Let's go.

551
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,982
Beautiful, isn't it?

552
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,734
It's not exactly St. Petersburg.

553
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:23,654
Jean-Yves...

554
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:26,532
I never expected this but it just hit me.

555
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:28,993
Call it what you like,

556
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:30,961
coincidence or fate.

557
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,705
But here we are.

558
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:36,876
Maybe I'm making
the biggest mistake of my life,

559
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,879
but I don't want to regret not making it.

560
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,381
This morning everything changed.

561
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,843
You turned my head upside down. Jean-Yves,

562
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,678
will you...

563
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,014
It's 13:37!
-What's wrong?

564
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,683
I'm going to Kilimanjaro.

565
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:54,894
If you want to come with me...

566
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,396
I'd love that.

567
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:58,814
Really?

568
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:08,282
Has being a guidebook author always been your dream job?
-Not at all.

569
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,867
I'm a writer.

570
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,161
But it doesn't pay.

571
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:13,746
What do you write about?

572
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:14,997
I write books for children.

573
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,333
But I won't bore you with it.

574
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:18,960
Okay. Great.

575
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,796
Well, it's about the adventures of Beurkys,

576
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:23,798
little furballs,

577
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,633
who struggle against...
-Careful!

578
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,011
...Who struggle against the cruel Arkos,

579
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,805
the evil ruler of the kingdom of Grull.

580
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,015
It takes place in a magic forest.

581
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:36,102
It may become a cartoon...
-That's great, but...

582
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:45,444
Excuse me, but there's something
I can't get off my mind since earlier.

583
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,071
What was that in the church about?

584
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,491
Put yourself in my position.

585
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,828
I meet the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

586
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,079
First,

587
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,907
she tells me to go to hell.
Only natural, happens to me every day.

588
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,459
Four hours later

589
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,088
I'm suddenly a God in her eyes.

590
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,207
Am I missing something?

591
00:32:06,274 --> 00:32:07,833
Can you explain?

592
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:10,344
No.

593
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:11,929
Forget it.

594
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,848
I got carried away, wrapped in the moment. Alone.

595
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,688
But you're not alone.

596
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,030
I don't think that's wise.

597
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:30,948
If I go down this road,

598
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,826
I'll never stop.

599
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,454
I've been there too often.

600
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,622
Relax.

601
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,665
You definitely won't regret it.

602
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:40,916
As Guytou says,

603
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,878
one simply has to see this when in Kenya.

604
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,715
Along here.

605
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,218
Thank you.

606
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,769
It's beautiful.

607
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:13,074
Isabelle...

608
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:24,377
I know, I'm lacking words to describe the beauty too.

609
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,128
Lion...

610
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,255
A lion.

611
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,424
There's a lion.

612
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,593
There's a lion!

613
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:35,346
No, wait, Isabelle, don't.

614
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:38,140
Never run from a predatory cat.

615
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,935
I'm going to die!
-Isabelle, listen to me.

616
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,481
We must look it in the eye
and show it we're not afraid.

617
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,858
I've seen this in a BBC documentary.

618
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,736
BBC is a reliable source.

619
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:51,779
Don't panic.

620
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,241
I don't want to die!

621
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,955
We must tame it.
It's just a big cat essentially.

622
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,243
It should understand German,
just like in a circus.

623
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:11,799
Crap!

624
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,225
Isabelle.

625
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,060
Another option is

626
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,396
to play dead and wait until it leaves.

627
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:29,668
Unbelievable!

628
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,629
I've never been so afraid.

629
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:34,298
You see, had I let you run...

630
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:35,382
You didn't freak out?

631
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:36,967
No, I swear.
-Clearly.

632
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,552
I really didn't.

633
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,721
I had doubts at some point,

634
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:43,015
but I wasn't afraid.

635
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:45,142
When I saw...

636
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,566
We have to go.
-What for?

637
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:54,568
Wait for me!

638
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:03,869
Don't worry,

639
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,162
it's not an animal.

640
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,248
Just a vehicle being started.

641
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,476
Did you leave the key in the ignition?

642
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,215
Affirmative.

643
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,556
The most important thing is to avoid dehydration.

644
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,058
I got myself lost in Taiga one time

645
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:27,810
and leaves saved my life.

646
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,562
Here, look...

647
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,565
Here.
-No, thanks.

648
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,650
But it's full of water.

649
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:39,071
Damn, that's bitter.

650
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,578
Elephant dung would be ideal.

651
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,455
It can be squeezed.
It's a bit disgusting,

652
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:52,042
but it's full of minerals,
like buffalo dung.

653
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,879
Zebras, however, make very small droppings,
almost like olives,

654
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,338
which is useless.

655
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:57,590
Shut up!

656
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,967
Please. Just for two seconds.

657
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,555
Isa, you've been too exposed to sun. Calm down.

658
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,266
We'll soon reach Kilimanjaro.

659
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,059
And there are lots of tourists there.

660
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,801
Correction.

661
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,471
Tourist destinations

662
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,906
are much less crowded in evening than during daytime.

663
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:06,742
Thank you.

664
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:16,251
We could have been
in a five star hotel right now,

665
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,421
but this here is better. There are billions.
-No, Jean-Yves.

666
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,590
I'm begging you. Stop with the phrase.

667
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,759
I don't have the strength for this.

668
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:24,969
Yes.

669
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,432
Look, the Great Bear.

670
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,351
No.

671
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:35,270
Really, that's the Great Bear.

672
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,522
No, it's Andromeda.

673
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,191
The Great Bear is there.

674
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:43,821
Cassiopeia,

675
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,280
Centaur,

676
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,282
Pegasus, Orion.

677
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,955
I have no merit.

678
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:56,250
My father worked at a Space centre near Munich.

679
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,293
Was he an astronaut?

680
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,045
No, not at all.

681
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,590
He never left his office.

682
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,050
But he loved astronomy.

683
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,180
I was five when we moved back to France.

684
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:13,142
He built me a tree house.

685
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,436
We called it "the observatory centre".

686
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,814
It was brilliant.

687
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:21,734
He set up a telescope twice my size.

688
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:25,195
We'd watch the stars together all night long.

689
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,867
He promised that someday
we'd fly to the Moon.

690
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,291
Then he left.

691
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,369
Jean-Yves?

692
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,500
Is there anyone there?

693
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,483
Like a gopher, not bad, right?

694
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,328
Right.
-You scared me last night.

695
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:41,707
I've arranged for you to return to Nairobi.

696
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,125
Antokontok.

697
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,751
Come here.

698
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:51,091
In Masai, "antokontok" means moped.
Fortunate, isn't it?

699
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:52,718
Come on!

700
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:54,803
Antokontok, Isabelle.

701
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,875
Hop on. He'll take you back to the hotel.

702
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:58,182
We'll see each other tonight.

703
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,100
Are you not coming with me?

704
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:02,811
No, I have to stay for the wedding.

705
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,230
What wedding?

706
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,608
Village chief's daughter is getting married.

707
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,194
White people can't normally attend.

708
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,487
I can describe this in the guide...
What are you doing?

709
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:14,239
I want to stay with you.

710
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,909
Yes?
-I don't like motorcycles.

711
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:37,512
A few details on a Masai wedding.

712
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,974
First, the groom,

713
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:44,519
encouraged by village people,

714
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:46,647
goes into the wedding hut.

715
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,986
Although it's ancient,

716
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:55,864
this tradition manages without modern aspects.

717
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,408
The woman freely decides

718
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:00,661
whether she follows her future husband into the hut.

719
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,756
If she takes the "orkila",

720
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:15,092
the traditional wedding dress,

721
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,761
and enters the hut,

722
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:19,846
then the marriage is validated

723
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,882
by the singing of the villagers.

724
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:46,581
I forgot my jacket in the hut.
Can you get it for me?

725
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:54,881
But you don't have a jacket.

726
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,361
Hang on.

727
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,489
Do you realise what we've done?

728
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:03,450
Yes.

729
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,619
What a skank!

730
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,246
I'm sorry but it's terrible,

731
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,998
the way she treated that poor guy.

732
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,501
True, it wasn't exactly right.
-I won't finish the story,

733
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,086
if you keep insulting my daughter.

734
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:15,796
That would be a shame.

735
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:18,882
Honey.
-I need to use the toilet.

736
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,637
I love my mother in law,
even if she's stingy.

737
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,098
Patrick!
-Wait with the presents.

738
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,099
Bring the turkey.

739
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:28,392
Of course.

740
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,812
And?
-Everything's fine.

741
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,063
I'm married.

742
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:35,315
Let's go.

743
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:38,443
How was it?
-Unusual. I'll explain later.

744
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:39,528
Sweetheart!

745
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:40,695
Isa!

746
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:42,614
Don't turn around.

747
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,910
What are you doing?

748
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:49,413
I told you already,

749
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,456
there's something I need to talk about with my sister.

750
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:52,916
It's urgent.

751
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,543
My sister in law!

752
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:57,629
Corinne. Delighted.

753
00:45:58,089 --> 00:45:59,423
Jean-Yves.
-Her husband.

754
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,675
Okay, bye.

755
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:04,594
Leaving me already?
-I'm late

756
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:05,804
for an appointment.

757
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:07,431
Meet you at your place then?

758
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:11,101
Alright, let's do that.
-I don't have your address.

759
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,227
I'll call you.

760
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:14,771
You don't have my number.

761
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:16,273
I'll call you.
-But how?

762
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:17,441
Wait!

763
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:19,484
Damn, you did it!

764
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:21,069
I knew it would work.

765
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:22,904
But why is your husband here?

766
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:25,449
He's not my husband.
It wasn't a traditional marriage.

767
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:26,616
Does it count?

768
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,578
It was a Masai wedding but it still counts.

769
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:32,289
You're free now, that's all that matters.

770
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,418
Is everything alright?

771
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:37,961
Yes, yes.

772
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:41,089
Patrick insists on managing the music

773
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:43,633
for your wedding to Pierre.

774
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:44,843
We'll see.

775
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:46,553
He's working on Voulzy.

776
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:48,180
You know what,

777
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,681
do what you want.

778
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:53,143
Veal chop? Sea bass?

779
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:56,479
No, I'd like something else. May I?

780
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,275
So, I'll have...

781
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:01,943
the rabbit.

782
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,988
She wants the rabbit.

783
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:06,865
And I do too. You live only once.

784
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:08,825
Thank you, Pascal.

785
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,371
So?

786
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:14,789
Everything is resolved.

787
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:18,293
Her depression was cured in three days?
-Whose?

788
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:20,587
Oh, Corinne? No, she's fine.

789
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,797
It's incredible, her healing.

790
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:25,926
And the practice?

791
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:30,222
Nothing out of the ordinary.
Mrs. Nizard was there.

792
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,807
She had an abscess on the fourth...

793
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:34,726
What is it?

794
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,020
Nothing.

795
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:38,313
I'm happy.

796
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:40,815
I'm glad to be here and that we're getting married soon.

797
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:44,027
I'm happy.

798
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:45,862
Me too.

799
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,837
It's not Friday yet.
-So?

800
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,882
We had a rabbit, didn't we?

801
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:50,135
Go on, Coco. Finish them off.

802
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:57,059
Nice ring! Thanks to you I look cheap.

803
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,228
Some of us have style.

804
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:01,688
Yes, some do.

805
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:05,150
How is the baby coming along?
-We're working on it.

806
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:07,485
How old are you? 49?

807
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:09,779
49? I'm 43.

808
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,865
Ah yes. You're brave, mate.

809
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,408
Even at the age of 30

810
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:16,578
rising at 5 am for peeing and pooping is hard.

811
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:17,954
But at your age?

812
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,582
And then the puberty kicks in.

813
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,959
By then, you're what, at least 60?

814
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:25,462
Your son hates you, takes drugs,

815
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:29,299
runs away, wants a scooter...
"Dad, I want a scooter."

816
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,509
"Never." The anxiety...

817
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:34,346
But don't think about it.

818
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:37,140
You want a child, great. Get on it!

819
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:40,352
Thanks.

820
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:41,770
Don't mention it.

821
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,232
Not a single pin!

822
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,235
Again, your fingers should align with the pins.

823
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,278
Like this, you have to...

824
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:52,322
Your fingers like this, into the...
What's going on?

825
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,657
Lane 14.

826
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:58,036
Oh no!

827
00:49:58,871 --> 00:49:59,663
Everything alright?

828
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,873
Yes.

829
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:05,210
I'm dying of thirst. I'll grab a drink.

830
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:21,017
What are you doing here?

831
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:23,978
I went to every bowling place in Paris.

832
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,231
There are much better ones than this one.

833
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:29,067
You can't just show up unexpectedly.

834
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,153
You lied to me. You're not single?

835
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:34,906
No, I'm not single.

836
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:39,119
I've watched you.
You don't love him.

837
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,246
You want to break it off,

838
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:43,456
so you fly to Kenya, you run into me,

839
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:45,959
it's love at first sight, a miracle of love.

840
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:47,836
You return to Paris,

841
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:52,215
but how do you tell him
you've met your soulmate?

842
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,884
Yes, it was exactly like that.

843
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,094
Exactly.

844
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,470
Give me some time. I have to tell him gently.

845
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,347
Okay, I'll wait at the car park.

846
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:00,598
No, no, no.

847
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:02,809
I need a bit more time.

848
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:05,061
Absolutely. Forgive me.

849
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,857
Take your time. He seems fragile.

850
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:19,659
And?

851
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:22,912
It's an obsession.

852
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:26,791
Good morning.
-Morning.

853
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:28,877
Hi, Katya.
-Hi, Isa.

854
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,545
And?

855
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,464
Isa, you have a patient waiting.

856
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:34,257
An emergency apparently.

857
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:36,301
Some Mr. Berthier.

858
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,678
Shall I take over?
-No, it's fine.

859
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:44,642
Are you crazy?!

860
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,438
Nice practice. Smells like money.

861
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:51,316
I have a surprise. But show me around first.

862
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:55,236
You said you'd give me time.

863
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,363
I thought it over.

864
00:51:57,573 --> 00:51:58,997
It'll be better if I tell him myself.
-No!

865
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:01,134
I've often been in his place.
I understand, how he must be feeling.

866
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,660
No.
-Really.

867
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,001
No!

868
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,629
Everything okay, Isa?

869
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,089
Yes, yes.

870
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,764
It's not right to act like this.

871
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:26,059
I'll tell him from here.
Mr. dentist...

872
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:27,852
Mr. dentist!

873
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:28,978
Isa, don't.

874
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,231
Be quiet!

875
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,819
Shut up!

876
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:39,572
Everything okay, Isa?

877
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:41,533
What's going on?

878
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:44,410
Everything okay?

879
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:46,120
Great.

880
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:47,455
Are you sure?
-Absolutely.

881
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:00,510
Oh my God.

882
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,220
What's the matter?

883
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:04,764
Nothing.

884
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:06,933
It's nothing.

885
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,184
Jean-Yves.
-What?

886
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,478
Listen to me.
-Mmm, yes.

887
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,146
Are you listening?
-Yes.

888
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:15,900
We had a great time in Kenya.
But it's over.

889
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:19,153
But I love you.

890
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,073
Maybe you love me,

891
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:23,366
but I don't love you.

892
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:26,744
I'll never love you, okay?

893
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:27,871
Okay.

894
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,123
From today on,

895
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:32,166
I never want to see you again.

896
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:35,879
You leave me alone, okay?
-Alright.

897
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:43,928
It'll be all right.

898
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,800
Will you need another appointment, Mr. Berthier?

899
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,986
Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

900
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:23,176
Date of the wedding?
-May 15th, please.

901
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:30,141
Is everything booked up?
-Just a moment.

902
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:32,644
One day either way won't make a difference.
-A moment, please.

903
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,647
I don't understand.
-Is there a problem?

904
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:37,315
You're already married.

905
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:39,192
Excuse me?

906
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:40,526
You're already married.

907
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,904
It must be a mistake.
-No.

908
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:44,113
Impossible.

909
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:50,745
There weren't any carparks. Where are you going?

910
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,414
Don't I need to sign anything?
-No.

911
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,416
One signature is enough. Where did you leave the car?

912
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:57,835
There's a marriage contract.

913
00:54:58,212 --> 00:55:02,215
A Masai wedding, but civilly
registered by Marc Berthier.

914
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,133
That's probably his brother.

915
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:06,886
You're already married.
-I don't believe this.

916
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,390
What?

917
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:13,059
It's funny, as per your agreement

918
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:15,561
on this goatskin,

919
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:18,898
you're entitled to three gold pieces, a hut

920
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:22,819
and half a litre of goat's urine.

921
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,689
If you haven't received that, I'll make sure you do.

922
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:35,915
Does this amuse you?

923
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:37,709
No. I apologise.

924
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,002
Serge, my sister needs you.

925
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:41,129
Yes, of course. I'm sorry.

926
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:45,174
This is completely illegal and we'll easily prove it.

927
00:55:45,718 --> 00:55:47,677
Great, let's do that.

928
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:50,096
It will be resolved in a year.

929
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,682
I'm getting married next month.
-Alright,

930
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:55,435
if he signs the divorce papers,

931
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:57,145
it's effective immediately.

932
00:55:58,147 --> 00:55:59,689
But since the man...

933
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:02,191
Give me the papers.

934
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,027
She's in big trouble.

935
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,988
I don't understand. Who validated the marriage then?

936
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:08,614
It just doesn't work that way.

937
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,867
We found out later on...

938
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,036
that his brother, Marc Berthier,

939
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,580
was a registrar in Paris.

940
00:56:16,415 --> 00:56:18,082
So they were married for real!

941
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:20,001
Yes, husband and wife.
-Exactly.

942
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,669
She furiously waited.

943
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:23,129
Time passed by.

944
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:25,173
She had to lull Pierre.

945
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:26,507
That wasn't hard.

946
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:27,759
But still.

947
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,889
I organised a fake bridal shower in Marrakesh.

948
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:35,224
My sister was furious.

949
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,559
She was hysterical.

950
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:38,394
She almost made me fear for her.

951
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,105
Jean-Yves was her husband. If he had to be,

952
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:44,233
she'd make his life hell.

953
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:46,944
He will beg for a divorce!

954
00:56:47,196 --> 00:56:49,030
I brought you warm clothes.

955
00:56:49,198 --> 00:56:50,990
The divorce papers.
-Thank you.

956
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:52,492
Bye.

957
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:53,576
Where to?

958
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:54,869
Moscow.

959
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:58,498
Everyone in Moscow knows
the Eleseevskii delicatessen.

960
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:02,126
But the best kept secret
of this gastronomic temple

961
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:04,545
is it's bakery,

962
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:06,339
where charming Irina

963
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:09,509
makes the best "pirozhki" in the city.

964
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,136
Often copied, never equaled.

965
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:16,557
Jean-Yves!
-Irina.

966
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,523
Irina, your pirozhki are a poem.

967
00:57:23,816 --> 00:57:25,024
You make me blush.

968
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:33,991
Good afternoon.

969
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,582
Irina, meet Isabelle.

970
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:43,668
His wife.

971
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,442
How did you find me?

972
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:11,821
The miracle of love.

973
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:18,953
I've constantly been thinking of you
since my little...

974
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:20,913
joke at the practice.

975
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:23,291
I needed time, but...

976
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:26,169
I finally know how I really feel.

977
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,298
I'll try my luck with you.

978
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:32,383
If you want it too.

979
00:58:34,887 --> 00:58:35,803
And your dentist?

980
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,306
He's out of the picture. It didn't work out.

981
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,558
It must be said,

982
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:43,269
I'm not very easy to get along with.

983
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:46,314
Yes, but we're made for each other.

984
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:48,774
Exactly.

985
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:00,912
Here it is.

986
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,165
What, this?
-Yes.

987
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,751
But it's horribly ugly.

988
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,794
Yes, but it's in a central location.

989
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,684
Hang on.
-What?

990
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:25,186
What is it?

991
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:32,944
Here we are.

992
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,987
Small, but comfortable.

993
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:45,581
So, what do you think?

994
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,625
Honestly?
-Yes, absolutely.

995
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,210
It's awful.

996
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:56,384
You have a green light to redecorate.

997
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:59,220
Because now it's your home too.

998
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:02,473
What was in your puff pastry?

999
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:03,766
Spinach.

1000
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:05,059
Are you sure?

1001
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:10,398
Make yourself comfortable. I'll make us coffee.

1002
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:30,001
Do you collect rats?
-No.

1003
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:33,296
These are Beurkys, characters for the cartoon.

1004
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:35,798
I already told you about it.

1005
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:39,844
I was surprised to see you in Moscow.

1006
01:00:40,012 --> 01:00:41,887
But I'm really glad you're here.

1007
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:46,058
I thought you were angry with me
for having registered the marriage.

1008
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:48,144
But I did the right thing, right?

1009
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:52,189
Oh, crap!

1010
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:53,816
I'm so sorry.

1011
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:55,401
I'm so clumsy, sorry.

1012
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:57,353
I break everything, I'm really difficult to live with.

1013
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:59,488
Don't worry, it doesn't matter.

1014
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:06,245
The city of wonders, kitten.

1015
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:12,126
Kitten. Nickname.

1016
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:14,982
A game I played with my sister where we'd
slap each other for giving nicknames.

1017
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,215
Sounds funny.
-It is.

1018
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:21,886
What a fool!

1019
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,055
Is he stupid or what?

1020
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:25,765
Well, he just didn't understand,

1021
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:27,558
that she didn't want him.

1022
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:29,226
Love is blind.

1023
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:30,311
A bohemian child.

1024
01:01:30,479 --> 01:01:31,854
Love is a bouquet of violets.

1025
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:33,314
Love...

1026
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:35,816
Too late. You lose.

1027
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:37,902
In any case,

1028
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:39,320
it was clear to her,

1029
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:41,030
she had to speed it up.

1030
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:45,493
Isa? Why is shampoo bottle empty?

1031
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:48,829
Isa?

1032
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:55,294
DEPILATING CREAM

1033
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,845
Want to use mine?
-Yes.

1034
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,101
Thanks.

1035
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:11,519
You're welcome.

1036
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:43,467
You're not dressed yet?

1037
01:02:44,803 --> 01:02:45,886
What's up?

1038
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:47,805
Is something wrong?

1039
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:07,783
I'm very sorry.

1040
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:10,161
I have no idea how I got them mixed up.

1041
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:12,288
Stop smiling.

1042
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:14,498
You must be super mad.

1043
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:17,084
The transplants cost you a fortune.

1044
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:19,795
It may never grow back and I'm to blame.

1045
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:23,215
It may. And it doesn't matter
even if it doesn't grow back.

1046
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:26,343
You're not with me for that anyway,
but for this.

1047
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:28,804
And this definitely won't fall out.

1048
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:45,112
Gum!

1049
01:03:45,614 --> 01:03:46,989
How are you?
-Who's that?

1050
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,075
Romain from Lonely Planet and Philippe

1051
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:51,911
from Guide Hachette. Competition.

1052
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:53,954
Handsome guys.

1053
01:03:57,125 --> 01:03:58,125
Oh, come on.

1054
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:05,382
The French ambassador.
I'll introduce you.

1055
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:07,801
Excuse me.

1056
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:10,971
Jean-Yves.
-Mr. ambassador.

1057
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:14,099
May I introduce my wife, Isabelle Berthier.

1058
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,267
Good evening.

1059
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:16,769
Mr. Paul Guignou,

1060
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,522
the ambassador of France.
-His wife, Alice.

1061
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:20,773
Good evening.

1062
01:04:20,941 --> 01:04:22,525
Katarina and Vladimir Oulianov.

1063
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:24,068
Delighted.

1064
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:26,695
And Andrei Petrovsky,

1065
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,281
and old friend of mine,
who doesn't do anything in particular.

1066
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:31,158
A freeloader.

1067
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:35,371
My dear Jean-Yves,
you amuse us with your writing,

1068
01:04:35,664 --> 01:04:37,831
and today you're a delight for our eyes too.

1069
01:04:38,667 --> 01:04:39,416
Thank you.

1070
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:40,501
Tell us,

1071
01:04:40,669 --> 01:04:42,545
how did the beast enchant the beauty?

1072
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:45,422
Private property. No entry.

1073
01:04:45,869 --> 01:04:47,704
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1074
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:52,846
Jean-Yves is modest,

1075
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:54,640
but you can tell us.

1076
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:55,724
Fine.

1077
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:57,434
In short,

1078
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:59,228
I worked on the street for years.

1079
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:03,691
Then I got tired of it

1080
01:05:04,276 --> 01:05:06,193
and started via internet.
You know how it goes,

1081
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:08,612
the client pays and gives me orders.

1082
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:11,365
Something like: "Mimic a goat",
"Call me pussy",

1083
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,867
"Stick that in your ass."
The usual stuff.

1084
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:15,619
And one day,

1085
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,580
Jean-Yves logs in.

1086
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,123
A ray of sunshine.

1087
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:21,250
The problem was,

1088
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:23,043
he always came too quickly,

1089
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:26,589
so he had to return four to five times a day.

1090
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,258
But that's how we became friends

1091
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:31,635
and we decided to meet after four years.

1092
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:34,179
That's not true, it wasn't like that.
-Yes it was.

1093
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:35,347
Absolutely not.

1094
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:37,391
That's not true.

1095
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:44,148
Alright, it was a joke.

1096
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:46,859
It's humour!

1097
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:13,927
Listen, Isabelle.

1098
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:16,013
Your little games

1099
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:17,514
don't work with me, kitten.

1100
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:22,102
Kitten. Nickname.

1101
01:06:28,096 --> 01:06:29,055
Thank you.

1102
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:34,156
Isabelle, your escapades...

1103
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:35,991
occur only because you're afraid.

1104
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,910
You panic, that's normal.

1105
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:42,081
"Till death do us part" fills you with fear.

1106
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,751
But it's beautiful, damnit!

1107
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:47,628
So just relax

1108
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:49,630
and drop your guard down.

1109
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:52,800
Embrace life.

1110
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:03,477
The show "Notchka" by Igor Petrovich

1111
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:06,438
is the trendiest cabaret...

1112
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:09,233
What now? Oh no.

1113
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:11,068
No, Igor...

1114
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,520
Jean-Yves Berthier. Music!

1115
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,119
No, out of the question.

1116
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:16,425
Coco, it's me. No, it's not going well.

1117
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:19,428
Nothing works. An utter disaster.

1118
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:23,307
I've done things which I never thought I was capable of.

1119
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:26,685
I act like a complete bitch

1120
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:29,396
and he just looks at me with his big puppy eyes.

1121
01:08:30,398 --> 01:08:32,191
It's upsetting me.

1122
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:33,859
I can assure you that.

1123
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,654
He'll never sign the divorce papers.

1124
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:38,906
Never.

1125
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:41,992
What's he doing now?

1126
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:46,747
I'll call you back.

1127
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:57,174
This tee is a specialty in the Caucasus.

1128
01:08:57,342 --> 01:08:58,634
It's very good.

1129
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,178
Would you like sugar?

1130
01:09:01,513 --> 01:09:03,514
Normally, it's drunk without it.

1131
01:09:05,517 --> 01:09:06,600
Isabelle?

1132
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:09,061
Isa?

1133
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:13,690
Isabelle?

1134
01:09:57,235 --> 01:09:58,193
<i>He'll never<i/></i>

1135
01:09:58,486 --> 01:10:00,487
<i>sign the divorce papers.<i/></i>

1136
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:01,655
<i>Never.<i/></i>

1137
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:09,079
<i>I've done things which I
never thought I was capable of.<i/></i>

1138
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:11,707

1139
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:16,253

1140
01:10:18,673 --> 01:10:20,215

1141
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:21,925

01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:26,179

01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:27,514

1144
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:31,101
<i>What's he doing now?<i/></i>

1145
01:10:40,056 --> 01:10:41,015
Thank you.

1146
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:54,041
What?

1147
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:57,085
Just a moment.

1148
01:10:58,296 --> 01:10:59,046
Alright then.

1149
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:01,548
Jean-Yves, he wants to be introduced.

1150
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,842
Richard, my "imaginary" friend.

1151
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:07,888
I know that for me you're very real.

1152
01:11:09,057 --> 01:11:11,266
Jean-Yves, may I introduce Richard.

1153
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:12,976
Richard, this is Jean-Yves.

1154
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:14,186
Satisfied?

1155
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:17,731
Well, say hi!

1156
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:22,653
Hi, Richard. How are you?

1157
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:24,988
So so? I understand.

1158
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:28,450
What? Really? You want me to do that?

1159
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:30,744
Alright, if it makes you happy.

1160
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,413
What are you doing?

1161
01:11:33,665 --> 01:11:37,250
Richard asked me to spread jam
on my face. Funny, isn't it?

1162
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:40,087
Stop.
-May I, please?

1163
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:41,922
I'm talking to Richard.

1164
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:44,633
Yes, Richard? Yes.

1165
01:11:45,051 --> 01:11:47,219
That too, of course. No worries.

1166
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:49,054
Like this?

1167
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:50,263
Here it goes.

1168
01:11:51,182 --> 01:11:52,683
Crap, it's hot!

1169
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:54,567
But we had a good laugh.

1170
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:55,936
Jean-Yves...

1171
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:58,188
Yes, Richard?

1172
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:01,883
How could I believe a woman like her
would like a guy like me?

1173
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:04,319
No idea, I just did.

1174
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:06,613
I must have been a bit stupid.

1175
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:10,283
So I want you to

1176
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:12,494
give her this.

1177
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:15,372
I found divorce papers in her bag.

1178
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:17,708
And I signed them.

1179
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:19,001
Bye, Richard.

1180
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:45,527
Jean-Yves!

1181
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:47,195
Wait.

1182
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:51,199
Jean-Yves, listen to me, please.

1183
01:12:51,826 --> 01:12:54,411
What do you want? You have the signature.

1184
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:58,248
Jean-Yves, I've been with someone for ten years.

1185
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:00,417
We're getting married in a month.

1186
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:04,546
But in my family the first marriage never lasts.

1187
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:07,424
So I needed a first husband

1188
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:08,925
and a divorce.

1189
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:13,764
Why me?

1190
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:15,932
I'm sorry for what I did to you,

1191
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,559
I was only thinking of myself.

1192
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,311
And then I don't know...

1193
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:22,189
You were simply in a wrong place at a wrong time.

1194
01:13:22,774 --> 01:13:24,066
You can hate me.

1195
01:13:24,776 --> 01:13:27,069
Jean-Yves!
-Crap, not them now!

1196
01:13:29,324 --> 01:13:33,784
Good afternoon.
Mr. Integrity falls for a call-girl?

1197
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:36,119
Not bad, Gum.

1198
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:39,539
Gum. Nickname.

1199
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:41,333
Bye.

1200
01:13:41,501 --> 01:13:42,292
No.

1201
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:43,585
Wait.

1202
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:45,921
Jean-Yves, listen to me.

1203
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:50,258
I never wanted to hurt you.

1204
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,306
You really are something!

1205
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:02,354
I still have 24 hours.

1206
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:04,231
Want to spend them together?

1207
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:08,693
Right after victory of the Soviet Union
over Nazi Germany,

1208
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,654
Stalin began with the construction

1209
01:14:10,822 --> 01:14:12,948
of Vyssotnyé Zdania,

1210
01:14:13,116 --> 01:14:14,699
also called "Vyssotki".

1211
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:18,245
Both names are derived from Russian word "vyssoko",

1212
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:20,997
that means "high".

1213
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:24,417
Am I annoying you?
-No, not at all.

1214
01:14:24,585 --> 01:14:25,794
But I can tell I am.

1215
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:27,045
No, do continue.

1216
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:28,463
Really?
-Yes.

1217
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:30,882
There are seven skyscrapers altogether.

1218
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:33,260
Initially, Stalin had planned eight to be built,

1219
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:35,595
for Moscow's 800th anniversary.
-Now you're boring me.

1220
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:37,931
I knew it. You see?

1221
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:40,608
Something's not right in that head of yours.

1222
01:14:43,104 --> 01:14:43,812
Why's that?

1223
01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:47,607
If Blandine married Solange first

1224
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:49,818
and then married Marcel,

1225
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:52,696
then your grandfather is...?
-Hector the first.

1226
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:54,531
Family stories are funny.

1227
01:14:54,699 --> 01:14:56,700
In my family, the big toe

1228
01:14:56,868 --> 01:14:58,785
is smaller than the second.

1229
01:14:58,953 --> 01:15:00,203
It's a bit like your story, isn't it?

1230
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:02,831
Doesn't look good?

1231
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:04,082
Isn't it good?

1232
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:05,333
No.

1233
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:06,751
I have another one.

1234
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:09,296
It goes well with my eyes.
-Right.

1235
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:11,381
Excellent! Perfect!

1236
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:12,966
Gorgeous.

1237
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:18,305
You went a bit too far though.

1238
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,182
My transplants, my bookshelf...

1239
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:21,183
I know.

1240
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:23,226
I'm sorry.

1241
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,395
But you're really stubborn too.

1242
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:27,522
I know, as soon as I like a woman

1243
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:29,274
I get cumbersome.

1244
01:15:30,818 --> 01:15:31,985
Is that right?

1245
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:39,951
Here, try this one.

1246
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:45,540
Do you like it?
-Yes.

1247
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:46,750
It's yours.

1248
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,460
Thank you.

1249
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:05,894
I have a riddle.

1250
01:16:06,854 --> 01:16:08,355
Now isn't the time.

1251
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:10,273
I know, but it's funny.

1252
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:14,527
Who's the least fortunate Russian in the history?

1253
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:16,446
I don't know.

1254
01:16:16,614 --> 01:16:18,657
Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.

1255
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:22,577
Travelled seventeen times around the Earth,
only to end up crashing in Russia.

1256
01:16:32,463 --> 01:16:33,588
Noone else is laughing.

1257
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:35,340
No, seriously, stop!

1258
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:36,258
Well,

1259
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:38,218
Gagarin is a national hero here.

1260
01:16:38,386 --> 01:16:41,554
Every year, there's national mourning on March 27th.

1261
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:49,562
What's the matter?

1262
01:16:52,275 --> 01:16:55,527
I forgot about my fathers death anniversary
for the first time.

1263
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:58,321
You're Gagarin's daughter?

1264
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:00,824
No! My father also died on March 27th.

1265
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:02,075
Oh yes,

1266
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:04,327
how stupid of me. He was German.

1267
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:08,164
And you're also too young, Gagarin died in 1968.

1268
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:16,506
Who are you more alike,
your mother or your father?

1269
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,051
My mother,

1270
01:17:20,303 --> 01:17:23,555
she leaves nothing to chance. I'm a bit like her.

1271
01:17:23,723 --> 01:17:24,681
I'd say quite a bit.

1272
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:26,683
Nice!

1273
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,393
But it's true.

1274
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:30,520
I hope I have a little of my father's ardour too.

1275
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:32,147
He was impetuous,

1276
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:35,567
passionate,

1277
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:37,527
crazy about my mother.

1278
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,114
Then the illness prevailed.

1279
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:43,325
They haven't divorced?

1280
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,160
No, he died.

1281
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:47,829
And he had never taken me to the Moon.

1282
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:51,207
Come with me.
-What?

1283
01:17:51,584 --> 01:17:52,667
Come.

1284
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:53,835
Where to?

1285
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:56,671
It's not the Moon, but it comes close.

1286
01:17:56,839 --> 01:17:58,131
What is it?
-Come with me.

1287
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,559
Well!
-What?

1288
01:18:09,727 --> 01:18:11,478
Never in my life!

1289
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:13,980
You can't find anything better.

1290
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:15,774
It's Russian and very sturdy.

1291
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:18,193
Ah, well, no!
-Yes, I insist, come!

1292
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:30,038
First we do a vertical climb.

1293
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:33,166
Then the plane enters a free fall mode.

1294
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:34,918
And then we'll be weightless.

1295
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:37,253
What did he say?
-Nothing, nothing.

1296
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:40,131
How long do we float?

1297
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:41,341
Approximately 20 seconds.

1298
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:44,010
Is there a problem? Tell me, now!

1299
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:46,346
No, no, everything's fine!

1300
01:18:46,514 --> 01:18:48,681
How many loops?

1301
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:49,891
Thirty.

1302
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:51,434
How many?!
-Thirty.

1303
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:52,936
What's that for?

1304
01:18:53,104 --> 01:18:55,397
For vomitting. Just in case.

1305
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:56,564
Oh no. No!

1306
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:58,400
I want to get off.
-No!

1307
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:50,910
Is everything alright?

1308
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:53,121
This was brilliant! Did you like it?

1309
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:54,456
Yes, yes!

1310
01:19:54,591 --> 01:19:55,249
Once more!

1311
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,839
Everything okay?
-Yes.

1312
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:29,240
You alright?

1313
01:21:52,074 --> 01:21:53,366
I can't do it anymore.

1314
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:27,066
And what if I was the one?

1315
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:29,652
You're the first.

1316
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:31,487
Yes.

1317
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:36,409
Well...

1318
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:38,995
Bye.

1319
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:02,328
How are you?

1320
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:03,538
You scared me.

1321
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:08,835
Had a nice flight?

1322
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:10,837
Yes, excellent.

1323
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,091
What's the matter?

1324
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:20,555
I have to tell you something.

1325
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:22,432
What?

1326
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:24,142
Are you pregnant?

1327
01:24:27,104 --> 01:24:29,355
No, not at all.
-Damn,

1328
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:31,190
you scared me.

1329
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:38,948
Sorry my love, I'm not yet fully awake.

1330
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:41,868
I'm impossible. Forgive me.

1331
01:24:43,162 --> 01:24:45,705
Children at my age, it's scary,

1332
01:24:45,873 --> 01:24:47,373
but it will work out fine, I promise.

1333
01:24:48,459 --> 01:24:49,542
It will.

1334
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:52,044
Alright.

1335
01:24:56,133 --> 01:24:57,967
Something else for a change.

1336
01:24:59,052 --> 01:25:00,136
Yes...

1337
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:04,557
I'll go.

1338
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:14,776
What are you doing here?

1339
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:16,319
Don't worry.

1340
01:25:16,487 --> 01:25:18,196
You forgot this.

1341
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:20,490
Thank you.

1342
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:23,493
Hello.

1343
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,662
This is Jean...

1344
01:25:26,789 --> 01:25:28,581
Jean-Paul, cousin from Québec.

1345
01:25:28,749 --> 01:25:30,374
I'm here for the wedding.

1346
01:25:31,251 --> 01:25:33,044
Great! Welcome.

1347
01:25:33,796 --> 01:25:34,712
Thank you.

1348
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:36,422
But the wedding is in three weeks.

1349
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:39,050
One can never be too early.

1350
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:41,052
As they say in Canada

1351
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:43,638
"Who yawns before 6 am
sets after midnight."

1352
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:47,350
I'm very happy for you two.

1353
01:25:47,893 --> 01:25:49,936
You have family in Canada?

1354
01:25:50,187 --> 01:25:51,270
Well, you know...

1355
01:25:51,438 --> 01:25:52,188
I'm

1356
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:55,233
the grandson of Hector, who emigrated to Québec

1357
01:25:56,109 --> 01:25:56,984
after Blandine

1358
01:25:57,236 --> 01:25:58,569
left him for...

1359
01:25:59,947 --> 01:26:00,947
Marcel.

1360
01:26:03,909 --> 01:26:07,036
We're past that point, aren't we, darling?
-Yes.

1361
01:26:09,456 --> 01:26:11,207
Well, I'll be off.

1362
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:15,336
I just wanted to let you know I came.
Karibu, Isa.

1363
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:17,713
Karibu...
-Pierre.

1364
01:26:20,968 --> 01:26:21,717
Karibu.

1365
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:35,940
Yep, you're bad.

1366
01:26:36,108 --> 01:26:38,150
Makes it fun.
-Right.

1367
01:26:38,402 --> 01:26:39,986
To the bride and the groom!

1368
01:26:40,571 --> 01:26:42,488
Enjoy it, it won't last.

1369
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:43,865
Very unsubtle.
-Don't worry.

1370
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:46,492
I don't believe in curses anyway.

1371
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:49,704
But your cousin from Québec,

1372
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:52,415
he's one of a kind.
-Who?

1373
01:26:54,001 --> 01:26:56,377
Well, Jean-Paul.
-Which Jean-Paul?

1374
01:26:57,129 --> 01:26:58,963
Jean-Paul, your cousin from Québec.

1375
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,134
You mean Jean-Paul.

1376
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:07,930
I didn't understand the way you said it at first.

1377
01:27:08,348 --> 01:27:10,683
He showed up at our door at 9am.

1378
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:12,643
With a bearskin hat.

1379
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:15,479
<i>"Karibu, Pierre. Karibu, Isabelle."<i/></i>

1380
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:18,608
<i>"I'm Jean-Paul. I come from Québec..."<i/></i>

1381
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:29,619
Isa, your foot.

1382
01:27:52,643 --> 01:27:53,517
I can't.

1383
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:55,686
Of course you can.

1384
01:27:55,896 --> 01:27:57,730
No, this. Us.

1385
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:01,442
Bowling every Monday,
with my foot never in the right place.

1386
01:28:02,152 --> 01:28:03,194
I'm fed up with it.

1387
01:28:04,237 --> 01:28:06,739
Always the same restaurant,
because it's the best one.

1388
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:08,074
I'm fed up with it.

1389
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:09,283
To know that we

1390
01:28:09,743 --> 01:28:12,370
never have a holiday in August,
because everything is full...

1391
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:14,038
Isa, the wedding is stressing you.

1392
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:15,790
But everything will go well.

1393
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:18,626
You don't understand.
I don't want it to go well.

1394
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:22,338
I don't want everything to happen as planned.

1395
01:28:23,173 --> 01:28:24,298
I want...

1396
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:28,469
to be startled, to be surprised.

1397
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:32,598
My alarm clock doesn't ring or the food burns
and it doesn't matter at all.

1398
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:34,016
Or...

1399
01:28:34,184 --> 01:28:35,267
I don't know,

1400
01:28:35,435 --> 01:28:37,603
We make love on Monday or Sunday.

1401
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:39,772
Or not at all for a month.

1402
01:28:43,276 --> 01:28:45,361
I want to be face to face with a lion.

1403
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:50,282
I don't understand, Isabelle.

1404
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:51,867
You've gone mad.

1405
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:53,452
Pull yourself together.

1406
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:56,539
No...

1407
01:28:57,374 --> 01:28:58,833
I haven't gone mad.

1408
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:00,835
Quite the opposite.

1409
01:29:08,427 --> 01:29:09,385
I'm sorry.

1410
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:25,067
Does that mean we won the game?

1411
01:29:25,819 --> 01:29:27,153
Shut it!

1412
01:29:29,406 --> 01:29:33,617
Do you want another slice
of the inevitable Sunday lamb?

1413
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:35,870
With great pleasure.

1414
01:29:37,581 --> 01:29:40,499
Isa, did you want another small piece?

1415
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:42,877
Don't you love meat?
-No, thanks.

1416
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:46,005
You really don't want another slice?

1417
01:29:47,424 --> 01:29:48,674
No, thank you.

1418
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:51,310
It was in the oven for seven hours.

1419
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:52,928
It's okay, mom, let it go.

1420
01:29:53,096 --> 01:29:55,556
Pierre would have loved it.

1421
01:30:02,189 --> 01:30:03,314
Do you do it on purpose?

1422
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:08,027
They've been separated for months.
Leave her alone.

1423
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:10,571
You just can't help yourself!

1424
01:30:24,294 --> 01:30:25,795
Damnit!

1425
01:30:29,883 --> 01:30:32,802
One day, some child will break a leg here.

1426
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:35,304
Better noone complains.

1427
01:30:44,773 --> 01:30:45,648
What are you doing here?

1428
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:48,818
Everything okay?

1429
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:49,985
Yes.

1430
01:30:54,491 --> 01:30:58,744
If only you knew, how many times
I wanted to demolish this hut...

1431
01:31:00,163 --> 01:31:01,372
But well...

1432
01:31:01,498 --> 01:31:04,708
you know your mother.
She would never allow it.

1433
01:31:07,587 --> 01:31:08,379
May I?

1434
01:31:18,181 --> 01:31:21,016
Do you know what it's like to wake up every morning

1435
01:31:21,601 --> 01:31:23,352
for 25 years,

1436
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:26,105
and see this damn hut,

1437
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:28,399
looking at you saying

1438
01:31:28,817 --> 01:31:30,526
"I was here before you"?

1439
01:31:32,362 --> 01:31:33,362
No.

1440
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:35,114
No?

1441
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:37,533
It scares you.

1442
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:42,246
At the same time, I'm not fooled. I know that...

1443
01:31:42,622 --> 01:31:45,583
the six years your mother spent with your father

1444
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:48,127
were the best of her life.

1445
01:31:48,628 --> 01:31:52,006
He was her first, but she did everything
to make sure he was the last.

1446
01:31:57,554 --> 01:31:58,804
Isabelle...

1447
01:32:00,098 --> 01:32:01,974
my little grasshopper...

1448
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:04,602
Stop wasting time.

1449
01:32:09,191 --> 01:32:10,399
You should have demolished it.

1450
01:32:10,901 --> 01:32:12,401
Are you crazy or what?

1451
01:32:13,111 --> 01:32:15,154
It's the only place,

1452
01:32:15,322 --> 01:32:17,740
where I can have a cigar,

1453
01:32:18,575 --> 01:32:19,992
without your mother breathing down my neck.

1454
01:32:20,827 --> 01:32:21,952
In peace.

1455
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,872
You never told me that.
-No.

1456
01:32:25,373 --> 01:32:26,999
I can still surprise you.

1457
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:31,670
Do you love me regardless?

1458
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:33,631
But of course.

1459
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:34,882
And Jean-Yves, damnit?

1460
01:32:35,217 --> 01:32:36,926
Take it easy.

1461
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:38,260
Excuse me, sorry.

1462
01:32:38,762 --> 01:32:41,597
She looked for him but he couldn't be found.

1463
01:32:41,765 --> 01:32:44,141
He resigned and disappeared.
No address, no phone number.

1464
01:32:44,643 --> 01:32:45,935
She phoned his brother.

1465
01:32:46,102 --> 01:32:48,854
He said he was renovating his house in Bésieux.

1466
01:32:49,022 --> 01:32:52,274
And guided English tourist groups.

1467
01:33:40,115 --> 01:33:41,240
That was it?

1468
01:33:41,408 --> 01:33:43,325
She came and left?

1469
01:33:43,493 --> 01:33:44,493
It sucks!

1470
01:33:44,661 --> 01:33:48,205
I can't believe it.
All you do is complain!

1471
01:33:48,331 --> 01:33:49,707
I slowly understand your ex.

1472
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:55,462
Sorry. Take more cake.

1473
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:33,375
I have a question.

1474
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:35,878
Sorry, it's over, we...

1475
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:49,408
Would you marry me again?

1476
01:34:52,979 --> 01:34:55,814
You know that in my family,
the first one doesn't last.

1477
01:34:56,775 --> 01:34:58,484
Look at us.

1478
01:34:59,944 --> 01:35:03,906
But if I remarry the first one,
he technically becomes the second.

1479
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:06,325
And that should work.

1480
01:35:07,243 --> 01:35:08,285
What do you say?

1481
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:12,790
No, I don't think it's...

1482
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:15,751
I love you.

1483
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,587
Please stop.

1484
01:36:03,842 --> 01:36:04,925
Come.

1485
01:36:07,971 --> 01:36:08,971
Here.

1486
01:37:39,354 --> 01:37:41,188
That was it. The end.

1487
01:37:42,315 --> 01:37:43,398
What do you think?

1488
01:37:45,652 --> 01:37:47,110
It's a lovely story.

1489
01:37:47,654 --> 01:37:49,446
But do you feel better?

1490
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:50,656
Yes...

1491
01:37:53,785 --> 01:37:54,952
Crap...

1492
01:37:55,061 --> 01:37:56,328
Here we go again.

1493
01:37:59,249 --> 01:38:00,541
This is crazy!

1494
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:02,834
We thought you'd like it.

1495
01:38:03,419 --> 01:38:05,629
It did make me feel better.

1496
01:38:06,631 --> 01:38:09,967
No, it's the wine and the champagne...

1497
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:12,719
And you're all so nice...

1498
01:38:14,055 --> 01:38:15,138
It's...

1499
01:38:15,348 --> 01:38:16,056
Even

1500
01:38:16,307 --> 01:38:19,101
if the story isn't true...
-It is.

1501
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:20,102
It's true.

1502
01:38:20,270 --> 01:38:21,812
But even if it wasn't,

1503
01:38:22,063 --> 01:38:23,480
I don't mind.

1504
01:38:23,606 --> 01:38:24,856
Very painful.

1505
01:38:26,359 --> 01:38:27,526
I'm sorry.

1506
01:38:27,694 --> 01:38:30,112
Come on, have some more wine.

1507
01:38:30,446 --> 01:38:32,364
To us!
-Merry Christmas!

1508
01:38:34,242 --> 01:38:37,369
Why aren't they here?
-They're on Galàpagos Islands.

1509
01:38:38,496 --> 01:38:41,582
An emergency at the practice.
It took longer than expected.

1510
01:38:41,749 --> 01:38:44,001
Valérie, meet Pierre.

1511
01:38:44,586 --> 01:38:45,669
Pierre?

1512
01:38:46,045 --> 01:38:48,463
Pierre, Isabelle's Pierre.

1513
01:38:49,257 --> 01:38:50,382
You haven't again...

1514
01:38:50,967 --> 01:38:53,760
Stop with the story. It makes me look like an idiot.

1515
01:38:53,928 --> 01:38:55,137
Not at all.

1516
01:38:56,055 --> 01:38:57,639
I don't think so.

1517
01:38:58,182 --> 01:38:59,182
Nice to meet you.

1518
01:39:00,435 --> 01:39:01,602
Nice to meet you too.

1519
01:39:02,937 --> 01:39:06,148
Give me the gifts.
Can you place them under the tree, honey?

1520
01:39:06,316 --> 01:39:08,609
Sit down, relax.
You too, Valérie.

1521
01:39:08,776 --> 01:39:10,944
Try the cake. It's delicious.

1522
01:39:11,112 --> 01:39:13,447
Valérie, finish yours. Otherwise there'll be trouble.

1523
01:39:13,615 --> 01:39:17,826
There's champagne, it's beautiful,
it's sublime, it's Christmas, right?

1524
01:39:58,201 --> 01:40:00,911
I save...

1525
01:40:01,412 --> 01:40:02,954
280 Euros...

1526
01:40:05,041 --> 01:40:07,834
I save...
My bag is at the back.

1527
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:09,795
But nothing serious?

1528
01:40:15,885 --> 01:40:18,720
This is inedible. You ate that?
-Yes.

1529
01:40:20,932 --> 01:40:24,309
There's no chance in life,
Jean-Yves, just destiny.

1530
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:29,064
Oh no...

1531
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:32,859
I'll replace Guytou.

1532
01:40:35,321 --> 01:40:38,198
I believe they said "action".

1533
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:43,870
Shy?

1534
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:44,955
Sorry.

1535
01:40:45,581 --> 01:40:46,998
Shy. Yeah, right.

1536
01:40:47,166 --> 01:40:48,542
Action!

1537
01:40:51,337 --> 01:40:54,673
The Beurkys are small animals... Sorry.

1538
01:40:57,927 --> 01:41:00,262
That was the second time already.

1539
01:41:01,139 --> 01:41:03,932
The woman decides whether
she follows her future husband

1540
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:06,518
into the hut.

1541
01:41:11,899 --> 01:41:13,275
In the hut...

1542
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:20,991
...follows her future husband into the hut.

1543
01:41:21,159 --> 01:41:22,826
The wonderful thing about it is,

1544
01:41:22,952 --> 01:41:26,621
that she will take orkila...

1545
01:41:27,373 --> 01:41:30,333
into the hut... or to the hut's entrance...

1546
01:41:32,754 --> 01:41:35,881
...follows her future husband into the hut. And...

1547
01:41:44,474 --> 01:41:45,766
Okay, go.

1548
01:41:46,517 --> 01:41:49,269
If she recovers orkila...

1549
01:41:49,437 --> 01:41:51,605
and in turn...

1550
01:41:58,362 --> 01:42:00,113
Go ahead, Coco. Finish them off.

1551
01:42:05,328 --> 01:42:07,996
A man smiles, another weeps...

1552
01:42:08,498 --> 01:42:10,248
a cruel cycle of life.

1553
01:42:10,792 --> 01:42:12,501
Smells of feet, doesn't it?

1554
01:42:15,379 --> 01:42:17,422
But I love you.

1555
01:42:19,842 --> 01:42:20,842
Excuse me.

1556
01:42:27,391 --> 01:42:29,643
What?
-I mumbled in Russian.

1557
01:42:30,686 --> 01:42:32,604
Don't worry, everything's fine.

1558
01:42:44,617 --> 01:42:46,660
Hit him on the thigh again.

1559
01:42:46,828 --> 01:42:48,370
Yes, excuse me.

1560
01:42:51,582 --> 01:42:52,791
Everything okay?

1561
01:43:06,848 --> 01:43:07,889
That's enough.

1562
01:45:01,170 --> 01:45:06,174
