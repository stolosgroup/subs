Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally.

I didn't realise that
you were gonna be back so early.

Hey, you got here fast.
I got a surprise for you.

45
00:04:13,508 --> 00:04:16,378
Peter, as you know,

46
00:04:16,813 --> 00:04:20,727
I love you very much.

47
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:26,990
Are you breaking up with me?

48
00:04:32,034 --> 00:04:36,818
- Pete, are you...
- I just need a minute.

49
00:04:37,688 --> 00:04:39,732
Okay.

50
00:04:58,433 --> 00:04:59,563
Please don't go.

51
00:04:59,564 --> 00:05:02,607
Why don't you just put on some clothes,
and we can sit down and discuss this.

52
00:05:02,608 --> 00:05:03,955
No. I can't do anything right now.

53
00:05:03,956 --> 00:05:06,565
I'm so sorry, Pete.

54
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:07,826
I'm in love with you.

55
00:05:07,827 --> 00:05:09,566
Why don't you just
put some clothes on, okay?

56
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:11,479
I'm not going to go put clothes on.

57
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,133
I know what that means,
if I put clothes on, it's over. Okay?

58
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,743
Excuse me.

59
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:29,659
Let's talk. Let's talk about him.

60
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:33,095
I feel...

61
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:36,966
I've been feeling

62
00:05:37,226 --> 00:05:41,141
for a long time
that we've been growing apart.

63
00:05:41,271 --> 00:05:44,576
We're leading different lives.

64
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:48,317
Who's the dude?

65
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:49,925
- Who's the dude?
- What?

66
00:05:49,926 --> 00:05:54,318
No, that's not what this is about.
There's no one else.

67
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,622
I know what's happening here. I really do.

68
00:05:56,623 --> 00:06:00,145
You've been working so much lately, that we
haven't got to spend much time together,

69
00:06:00,146 --> 00:06:01,494
and you're forgetting
what it's like to be with me.

70
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:03,798
But maybe, if we just held each other
or something,

71
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:05,495
you would remember
what it's like to be with me.

72
00:06:05,496 --> 00:06:08,061
- No.
- Just hold me.

73
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:15,455
Please. Here we go.

74
00:06:21,543 --> 00:06:24,414
There's someone else.

75
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:28,153
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:44,897 --> 00:06:49,028
We don't hang out in places like this,
Liz and I.

77
00:06:49,072 --> 00:06:53,029
Why did you take me here?
This place smells like stripper's perfume.

78
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:56,900
I'm gonna get herpes
just from sitting on this couch.

79
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:59,509
- Sure you okay, bro? Yeah?
- Yeah.

80
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,293
Yeah. You don't have to keep asking me.
I'm good.

81
00:07:02,294 --> 00:07:04,901
<i>- You're out!
- Thank you so much for this opportunity.</i>

82
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:07,164
- Auf Wiedersehen!
- Auf Wiedersehen!

83
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:10,338
<i>Thank you. Thank you all.</i>

84
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:12,383
<i>Auf Wiedersehen!</i>

85
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:15,427
I feel really good. I feel happy.

86
00:07:15,428 --> 00:07:18,384
<i>Maybe you should work
on the Dracula musical.</i>

87
00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:21,820
Look, you've been working on it for a while.
It'll help your mind. Be creative.

88
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:23,777
- Think about you.
- I think I need to fuck somebody.

89
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:25,037
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

90
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,256
You're not my stepbrother any more.
You're a step-stranger.

91
00:07:28,257 --> 00:07:29,821
- Why you talking like that?
- Brian!

92
00:07:29,822 --> 00:07:31,909
You don't need to put
your P in a V right now.

93
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,519
No, I don't.
I need to B my L on somebody's T's.

94
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,129
That's disgusting.
You don't need to be doing that.

95
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,825
And if anything,
you should leave your P in the V

96
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:45,478
and blow it inside the V,
so you can have a B-A-B-Y

97
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:46,826
and be a normal person.

98
00:07:46,827 --> 00:07:48,827
I'm leaving, man. I'm out of here.

99
00:07:48,828 --> 00:07:52,784
She's fucking somebody.
Okay, Bri? It's all I can think about,

100
00:07:52,785 --> 00:07:54,133
is that she's out there,

101
00:07:54,134 --> 00:07:56,959
and until I do the same thing,
I'm gonna feel like I wanna die.

102
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,134
So just talk to girls with me tonight,
all right?

103
00:08:01,135 --> 00:08:05,963
All right. All right, I'll help you out.
I'll talk to girls with you.

104
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:08,528
So, Peter, what do you do?

105
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,093
Musician.

106
00:08:10,094 --> 00:08:14,748
<i>He's being modest.
He works on a show called Crime Scene.</i>

107
00:08:14,966 --> 00:08:16,878
Oh, my God!

108
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,792
- It is what it is, you know?
- No, I love that show.

109
00:08:19,793 --> 00:08:23,011
<i>Wait, Crime Scene: Scene of the Crime
or Crime Scene: Phoenix?</i>

110
00:08:23,012 --> 00:08:27,751
<i>- Scene of the Crime.
- Oh, my God! I love that show.</i>

111
00:08:28,013 --> 00:08:31,926
I find you both very sexually attractive.

112
00:08:32,622 --> 00:08:35,404
Let's pump the brakes. Okay?

113
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:37,796
I think that having sex with either of you

114
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:40,623
would be a great treat for me.

115
00:08:40,624 --> 00:08:43,321
You are so funny.

116
00:08:43,887 --> 00:08:46,451
I just got out of
a five-and-a-half-year relationship,

117
00:08:46,452 --> 00:08:49,714
so I'm not looking for anything serious.

118
00:08:49,715 --> 00:08:54,192
- Just sexual activity.
- Let's wrap it up, buddy.

119
00:08:54,193 --> 00:08:56,977
You wanna come home?

120
00:08:57,717 --> 00:09:00,455
I'm sorry, you're cracking me up.

121
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,108
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

122
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:04,717
Do you wanna come home?

123
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:07,371
Stop it, seriously.

124
00:09:12,546 --> 00:09:16,416
- That was fun.
- Yeah, yeah.

125
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:20,201
Overall, I think that
went really well. Yeah.

126
00:09:29,116 --> 00:09:31,682
I want to have sex with you!

127
00:09:39,641 --> 00:09:43,250
- Are you crying?
- What? No.

128
00:09:43,294 --> 00:09:47,164
I'm sorry that I'm being so weird now.

129
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:49,556
No, that's okay.

130
00:09:49,557 --> 00:09:52,165
You've been weird

131
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:57,906
pretty much the whole time,
so it's not unusual. Okay.

132
00:09:57,907 --> 00:10:03,430
Last night, like some sort of idiot, I had
sex with this woman who I barely even know.

133
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:06,735
I used a condom, but

134
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:10,084
I'm really scared that I have an STD, Doc.

135
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:13,389
Peter, I'm a paediatrician. Have you noticed
you're sitting on a fire truck?

136
00:10:14,172 --> 00:10:16,128
- Right.
- Little kids running?

137
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:19,912
- Yeah, this is new. I like it.
- I'm kind of backed up...

138
00:10:19,913 --> 00:10:23,305
Could you take a look at my penis?

139
00:10:24,697 --> 00:10:26,349
Go ahead. Let me see it.

140
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,872
- Sorry.
- That's all right. Take it out.

141
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:32,220
Good.

142
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:34,481
- You barely looked at it.
- It's a good-looking dick, Peter.

143
00:10:34,482 --> 00:10:36,264
- Beautiful dick.
- Do you think maybe while I'm here,

144
00:10:36,265 --> 00:10:38,656
- I could get some blood work?
- Peter!

145
00:10:38,657 --> 00:10:41,136
Your girlfriend dumped you, right?
Are you hurting? Are you hurt?

146
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:46,920
Stop it. Stop crying. Use your dick.
Keep fucking. Fuck everything that moves.

147
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:48,050
Just wear a condom.

148
00:10:48,051 --> 00:10:51,704
Listen, I'm backed up,
I got a lot of kids. I gotta go, okay?

149
00:10:51,705 --> 00:10:56,271
You want something?
You want a balloon? You want a lolly?

150
00:11:05,274 --> 00:11:07,621
I just came!

151
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,018
Hi.

152
00:11:26,845 --> 00:11:28,322
Hi.

153
00:11:28,323 --> 00:11:30,801
- Hi.
- Hi.

154
00:11:30,802 --> 00:11:32,933
Hi.

155
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:38,107
- Hi.
- Hi.

156
00:11:38,108 --> 00:11:44,849
Okay, do you mind not saying that
over and over again?

157
00:11:44,893 --> 00:11:47,328
You can gag me.

158
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:54,025
- You brought a gag?
- And handcuffs.

159
00:11:54,591 --> 00:11:57,199
Do you wanna gag me?

160
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,636
Kind of, now.

161
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:06,681
What've we got today?

162
00:12:06,682 --> 00:12:09,639
Just a walk and talk at the lab.

163
00:12:10,943 --> 00:12:14,770
<i>That's what 20 years on Vice will do to you.</i>

164
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:16,596
<i>What've we got here?</i>

165
00:12:16,597 --> 00:12:20,119
<i>The victim's penis was found
behind the AC unit.</i>

166
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,902
<i>Ouch!</i>

167
00:12:21,903 --> 00:12:25,077
<i>Can you say "dicksicle"?</i>

168
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,166
<i>Let's do this.</i>

169
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:32,644
Okay, I'm ready.

170
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:36,777
<i>The victim's penis
was found behind the AC unit.</i>

171
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:42,560
Just go with the usual stuff, maybe.
Something dark and ominous.

172
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:46,171
Like losing your penis is a bad thing.

173
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,779
Oh, you want dark and ominous.

174
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:55,477
Come on, I got Allman Brother tickets,
I gotta get out of here!

175
00:12:55,478 --> 00:12:59,391
<i>That's what 20 years on Vice will do to you.</i>

176
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,739
<i>What've we got here?</i>

177
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,044
Peter! Peter, Jesus Christ!

178
00:13:04,045 --> 00:13:07,349
You're fucking Billy Baldwin, aren't you?

179
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,567
- Aren't you?
- Pete, Pete, Pete.

180
00:13:09,568 --> 00:13:12,525
- Stop staring at me.
- Pete!

181
00:13:14,048 --> 00:13:16,830
You know you're not getting paid
for today's session, right?

182
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:20,136
- I'm aware of that.
- Fucking asshole.

183
00:13:20,397 --> 00:13:23,484
Peter, it's Brian.

184
00:13:23,746 --> 00:13:25,833
Go away.

185
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:28,311
Listen, your landlord called me.

186
00:13:28,312 --> 00:13:30,094
Said there's smoke
coming out of your place.

187
00:13:30,095 --> 00:13:33,618
Who, Mr Lopez? 'Cause he's a liar!

188
00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:34,878
He doesn't...

189
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:36,879
We worry about you, Petey.

190
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,358
Yeah, come on, Peter. Open up the door.

191
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:43,620
The fire marshal's gonna come in
and bust it down.

192
00:13:48,753 --> 00:13:50,753
You haven't been
out of the house in two weeks.

193
00:13:50,754 --> 00:13:51,883
Why are you so damn strong?

194
00:13:51,884 --> 00:13:54,928
I feel so strong!

195
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:59,234
Hey, don't walk away from me.
You come close.

196
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,886
Your place is disgusting, Peter.

197
00:14:01,887 --> 00:14:02,930
Hey, don't walk away from me.

198
00:14:02,931 --> 00:14:04,974
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

199
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:07,844
What are you burning, man? Come on.

200
00:14:07,845 --> 00:14:08,975
It's everything.

201
00:14:08,976 --> 00:14:11,802
It's everything that reminds me of her
and I need it gone!

202
00:14:11,803 --> 00:14:16,194
Okay, I thought I was fine, Brian,
and I'm not. I'm not fine at all.

203
00:14:16,195 --> 00:14:19,108
Okay, let's just put the picture down.

204
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:22,109
Put that down. Let's discuss this.

205
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,414
- I love her, man.
- I know.

206
00:14:24,415 --> 00:14:30,372
Look, Liz and I,
we think the world of Sarah.

207
00:14:30,373 --> 00:14:32,677
We think she's great.

208
00:14:32,678 --> 00:14:35,156
Okay, but everything...

209
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:36,939
I'm just being honest here.

210
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,159
Every time she would come over
to our house,

211
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:44,072
she always acted,

212
00:14:44,246 --> 00:14:48,552
you know, like a little bitch!

213
00:14:48,726 --> 00:14:50,682
Okay, okay, pump the brakes.

214
00:14:50,683 --> 00:14:54,118
Dating Sarah is not like dating Liz. Okay?

215
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:56,119
Sarah is better than Liz.

216
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,771
You really wanna have this conversation?

217
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:03,469
Do you really
wanna have this conversation?

218
00:15:03,817 --> 00:15:04,990
Yes.

219
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:06,947
- She is the mother of my unborn child.
- Sorry.

220
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,340
You're my stepbrother.
We're not even blood.

221
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,601
I have no qualms with sticking you.
I will equalize you.

222
00:15:12,602 --> 00:15:14,558
- Sorry.
- You dick!

223
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,863
I'm just worked up.

224
00:15:16,864 --> 00:15:19,777
You gotta get your shit together, man.

225
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:22,648
I'm trying to. It's so hard here.

226
00:15:23,344 --> 00:15:25,213
Brian, everywhere I look,
I'm reminded of her, okay?

227
00:15:25,214 --> 00:15:28,649
Like, she got me this,

228
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,867
okay, because I would always leave
my cereal boxes open,

229
00:15:31,868 --> 00:15:33,346
and the cereal would get stale,

230
00:15:33,347 --> 00:15:36,173
and so one day I came home,
and she had this waiting for me,

231
00:15:36,174 --> 00:15:41,349
because it keeps my cereal fresh.
And now I have the freshest cereal.

232
00:15:43,785 --> 00:15:45,523
Why don't you,
you know what, go on a vacation?

233
00:15:45,524 --> 00:15:47,306
Go to the Alps.

234
00:15:47,307 --> 00:15:50,351
- Alps?
- Go to Gstaad. It's the best.

235
00:15:50,352 --> 00:15:51,699
I could go to Hawaii.

236
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,612
Sarah was always talking about this place
in Hawaii that was supposed to be nice.

237
00:15:54,613 --> 00:15:56,395
No, don't. I wouldn't go there.

238
00:15:56,396 --> 00:16:00,136
What, I can't go to Hawaii now, because
Sarah Marshall has heard of Hawaii?

239
00:16:00,137 --> 00:16:03,050
Then go to Hawaii. Go to Hawaii.

240
00:16:03,051 --> 00:16:05,095
Do it.

241
00:16:09,923 --> 00:16:12,009
No, no, no, don't destroy the computer.

242
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,400
I'm just deleting these pictures.

243
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:16,881
Okay, I need them off my computer.

244
00:16:17,446 --> 00:16:20,794
You know what? You're not even doing
a proper permanent delete.

245
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:22,142
Well...

246
00:16:22,143 --> 00:16:25,056
If we end up getting back together,
I wanna have a few of them left.

247
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:27,100
You're crazy.

248
00:16:27,971 --> 00:16:30,232
- No, no, please don't delete them.
- They have to go. Done, done.

249
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,323
<i>That was hilarious. Aloha!</i>

250
00:16:46,324 --> 00:16:49,454
<i>I'm Sarah Marshall from Crime Scene:
Scene of the crime.</i>

251
00:16:49,455 --> 00:16:52,281
<i>And when I'm not scrubbing for evidence,
I'm flying Hawaiian Airlines...</i>

252
00:16:52,282 --> 00:16:53,325
Excuse me! Hi.

253
00:16:53,326 --> 00:16:54,760
<i>...to my favourite destinations. Mahalo.</i>

254
00:16:54,761 --> 00:16:57,457
Hi, can I have another bloody mary, please?

255
00:16:58,022 --> 00:17:00,196
You're still working on that one.

256
00:17:00,197 --> 00:17:02,805
It's just an anticipatory order.

257
00:17:02,806 --> 00:17:05,807
Okay, I'll be right back!

258
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,984
<i>What do you think caused
such excessive bleeding?</i>

259
00:17:18,985 --> 00:17:24,029
<i>He was either stabbed in the aorta
or it was his time of the month.</i>

260
00:17:34,815 --> 00:17:36,990
<i>Aloha!</i>

261
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,990
Check in this way.

262
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,645
- Just married?
- Yes, how did you guess?

263
00:17:52,646 --> 00:17:57,255
Oh, you've got that magic newlywed dust
all over you.

264
00:17:57,256 --> 00:18:00,038
- Oh, my wife.
- Oh, my husband.

265
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:01,821
- Oh, my wife.
- My husband.

266
00:18:01,822 --> 00:18:04,823
My old ball and chain.

267
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:11,303
You quit squirming and come here.

268
00:18:11,304 --> 00:18:14,129
What is into you?

269
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,782
Not me, yet.

270
00:18:15,783 --> 00:18:19,957
Here is your room key.
So you're all set. Room 222.

271
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,262
Room key's inside,
and the elevators are to the right.

272
00:18:22,263 --> 00:18:23,393
<i>Mahalo.</i>

273
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,959
Congratulations.

274
00:18:27,699 --> 00:18:29,786
Here you go, sir. Have some POG juice.

275
00:18:29,787 --> 00:18:31,873
Welcome to Turtle Bay.
What can I do for you?

276
00:18:31,874 --> 00:18:34,135
I'm checking in.
My name's Bretter, Peter Bretter,

277
00:18:34,136 --> 00:18:36,880
but actually, I don't have a reservation.

278
00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:40,485
I just thought I'd take my chances.

279
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,702
Bold!

280
00:18:42,703 --> 00:18:46,877
We are all booked up,
but we do have the Kapua suite available.

281
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:50,531
- Okay. How much is that?
- $6,000 a night.

282
00:18:50,532 --> 00:18:52,835
- Wow.
- Beautiful views.

283
00:18:52,836 --> 00:18:54,880
I can imagine.
That's a little bit out of my price range.

284
00:18:54,881 --> 00:18:56,793
Sorry.

285
00:18:56,794 --> 00:19:00,186
That's a shame. This is a beautiful

286
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,143
hotel.

287
00:19:03,144 --> 00:19:06,666
<i>Oh, yeah, it's Sarah Marshall
from Crime Scene.</i>

288
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:09,450
People are excited that she's here.

289
00:19:10,145 --> 00:19:13,450
She's my ex-girlfriend.
We broke up three weeks ago.

290
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:15,755
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Right. This is fine, right?

291
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:19,670
- Sir?
- It's totally fine. Okay, there she is.

292
00:19:21,062 --> 00:19:24,105
- Did she see me? Is she coming over here?
- Uh-huh. Yup.

293
00:19:24,106 --> 00:19:25,888
I wish I wasn't wearing this fucking shirt.

294
00:19:25,889 --> 00:19:29,890
Fair enough.
Why don't you try to unbutton it?

295
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:33,108
Button it back up.

296
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,760
- Peter!
- Hey.

297
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:38,370
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

298
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:40,979
Came here to murder you.

299
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,110
Really, what are you doing here?

300
00:19:44,111 --> 00:19:47,850
I have been having a tough time,
you know, back in LA.

301
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:50,982
But then I came here, and here you are.

302
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:53,417
I just think that's too crazy to be...

303
00:19:53,418 --> 00:19:55,984
Hello there, you little sex object.

304
00:19:55,985 --> 00:19:58,810
I've lost a shoe.
Have you seen it anywhere?

305
00:19:58,811 --> 00:20:03,899
It's like this one, but, you know,
obviously it's the opposite one.

306
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:09,683
Excuse me, missus, I've lost a shoe.
Like this one. It's like this one's fellow.

307
00:20:09,684 --> 00:20:12,901
- Sort of the exact opposite, in fact, of that.
- Uh-huh.

308
00:20:12,902 --> 00:20:15,380
Not an evil version, but just, you know,

309
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:19,686
a shoe like this, but for the other foot.
Otherwise, I'd have two right...

310
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:21,251
Aldous, this is Peter.

311
00:20:21,252 --> 00:20:26,080
Hey, all right, Peter.
Nice to meet you, mate. Aldous.

312
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,645
- Good to meet you, man.
- My ex-boyfriend.

313
00:20:28,646 --> 00:20:30,949
Right. Hey, I'm Aldous Snow.

314
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,429
I know who you are.
Yeah, you're very, very famous.

315
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,516
Yeah, I am. I am for my sins.

316
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:38,039
So are you staying here, as well?

317
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,473
- I'm not, as a matter of fact...
- I'm sorry.

318
00:20:39,474 --> 00:20:42,083
Excuse me, Mr Bretter, Ms Marshall,

319
00:20:42,084 --> 00:20:47,259
but we were able to book the
Kapua suite for you, sir, for four nights.

320
00:20:49,086 --> 00:20:51,739
- You were?
- Yes, sir.

321
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,130
- Marvellous.
- Perfect. Perfect amount of time.

322
00:20:55,131 --> 00:20:57,740
Listen, if you wanna have dinner with us
one of those nights...

323
00:20:57,741 --> 00:20:59,175
- Aldous.
- ... feel very...

324
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:00,349
No.

325
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,741
That's very gentlemanly of you,
but you two enjoy your trip.

326
00:21:02,742 --> 00:21:04,916
I'll be just fine on my own.

327
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:07,829
- All right, Peter.
- The Kapua suite...

328
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:11,395
- Have a good trip, Pete.
- I like your shirt. It's colourful.

329
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:13,266
- Bye.
- Bye now.

330
00:21:13,267 --> 00:21:16,659
Ta-ta. I was wearing two shoes
this morning, right?

331
00:21:21,182 --> 00:21:24,573
Thank you. Thank you for bailing me out.
I still can't afford that room.

332
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:28,095
Nobody can.
It's for, like, Oprah or, like, Cיline Dion.

333
00:21:28,096 --> 00:21:29,444
Really, it's not a big deal.

334
00:21:29,445 --> 00:21:32,140
So you can stay in the suite,
but since you're not technically a guest,

335
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:34,446
you have to clean up after yourself.

336
00:21:34,447 --> 00:21:37,925
Otherwise, here is your room key

337
00:21:37,969 --> 00:21:40,752
and enjoy your stay.

338
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:44,101
Why are you doing this for me?

339
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:48,623
She's here with some guy already?
Kind of messed up.

340
00:21:48,624 --> 00:21:50,972
- Right?
- Yeah.

341
00:21:51,451 --> 00:21:53,320
- Thank you.
- Really, it's not a big deal.

342
00:21:53,321 --> 00:21:54,755
Go enjoy yourself.

343
00:21:54,756 --> 00:21:57,799
Rachel Jansen.
A thousand times, thank you,

344
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,191
- you know what I mean...
- Go enjoy yourself.

345
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:03,409
<i>- This is a disaster!
- Calm down, man.</i>

346
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,801
<i>Are there other hotels on the island?</i>

347
00:22:04,802 --> 00:22:06,236
Of course there are other hotels,

348
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:08,324
but I'm not leaving here,
it'll look like I'm running away.

349
00:22:08,325 --> 00:22:11,759
Wait. Why are you whispering?
You're not following them, are you?

350
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,021
I had a girlfriend, right?

351
00:22:13,022 --> 00:22:17,196
And Liam and Noel Gallagher both
had it off with her right in front of me,

352
00:22:17,197 --> 00:22:18,631
so that's similar.

353
00:22:18,632 --> 00:22:20,327
And that was a bit awkward, actually.

354
00:22:20,328 --> 00:22:23,328
So if you do wanna change hotels,
I quite understand.

355
00:22:23,329 --> 00:22:25,937
No, no, I'm not changing hotels.

356
00:22:25,938 --> 00:22:28,243
Stop following
and just go back to your room, Peter.

357
00:22:28,244 --> 00:22:30,417
<i>- They're gone!
- Why are you looking for them?</i>

358
00:22:30,418 --> 00:22:32,418
<i>- I don't know.
- You're acting like an idiot.</i>

359
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:34,505
<i>Run! Get out of there! Go to your room!</i>

360
00:22:34,506 --> 00:22:36,593
<i>- What do you think they're doing?
- Peter, go.</i>

361
00:22:36,594 --> 00:22:38,680
Oh, God! Okay, there they are.

362
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:40,420
<i>- There they are, I see them.
- Go back to your room, Peter.</i>

363
00:22:40,421 --> 00:22:42,116
Peter, go back to your room.
Go back to your room, Peter.

364
00:22:42,117 --> 00:22:43,246
I'm going in.

365
00:22:43,247 --> 00:22:45,117
<i>Go back to your room, Peter.
Are you listening to me?</i>

366
00:22:45,118 --> 00:22:47,552
<i>Peter, go back to your room.
Peter, Peter, Peter...</i>

367
00:22:47,553 --> 00:22:49,597
<i>Hey!</i>

368
00:22:49,945 --> 00:22:52,031
Hey, nice room.

369
00:22:52,032 --> 00:22:54,119
<i>Go!</i>

370
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,206
I am in the Kapua suite.

371
00:22:56,207 --> 00:22:59,207
<i>What are you doing? Sucker!</i>

372
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:01,340
Have fun.

373
00:23:01,905 --> 00:23:04,514
<i>Listen, you piece of shit!</i>

374
00:23:04,515 --> 00:23:09,690
<i>You're an idiot. Back to your room, Peter.
Peter, back to your room.</i>

375
00:23:10,777 --> 00:23:12,255
Did you enjoy that?

376
00:23:12,256 --> 00:23:14,864
<i>- Did you like what you saw?
- That hurt a lot.</i>

377
00:23:14,865 --> 00:23:18,866
But I know Sarah,
and I'm pretty sure I just ruined her day.

378
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,609
<i>You know
how we thought the killer masturbated</i>

379
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,914
<i>before he committed each homicide?</i>

380
00:23:37,915 --> 00:23:39,784
<i>That's the theory.</i>

381
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,872
<i>Take a look at the microscope.</i>

382
00:23:44,264 --> 00:23:48,091
<i>Oh, yeah, looks like where he's going,</i>

383
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:51,918
<i>he'll need to know how to masturbate.</i>

384
00:24:03,226 --> 00:24:05,270
Oh, God!

385
00:24:08,966 --> 00:24:11,837
<i>- Hello.
- Hey, Peter?</i>

386
00:24:12,098 --> 00:24:14,272
<i>- Sarah?
- No.</i>

387
00:24:14,273 --> 00:24:18,534
It's Rachel Jansen, from the front desk.

388
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:22,622
<i>- Hey!
- Hey, what's going on up there?</i>

389
00:24:22,623 --> 00:24:25,970
I'm getting complaints
about a woman crying hysterically.

390
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:28,971
Yeah, you know what, I hear her, too,

391
00:24:28,972 --> 00:24:32,320
and it sounds like
she's having such a hard time.

392
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:35,234
I think it's coming from the floor above me.

393
00:24:35,235 --> 00:24:38,105
You're on the top floor.

394
00:24:39,105 --> 00:24:41,714
I'll try to keep it down.

395
00:24:41,715 --> 00:24:44,193
<i>- Are you okay?
- Yeah, you have a nice night.</i>

396
00:24:44,194 --> 00:24:46,368
<i>Okay.</i>

397
00:25:00,068 --> 00:25:04,459
I would love to sell you some weed, Jeremy,
but I'm at my fucking job right now.

398
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,722
Obviously, because you called me at work,
you know that I'm at my place of work.

399
00:25:08,723 --> 00:25:10,809
So I can't just leave here
and sell you some weed.

400
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,201
I can sell you some weed when I'm done.

401
00:25:13,202 --> 00:25:16,941
<i>Hold on, I gotta call you back.
Mahalo, all right.</i>

402
00:25:16,942 --> 00:25:19,246
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hey.

403
00:25:19,247 --> 00:25:21,117
I'd just like to grab some dinner, please.

404
00:25:21,118 --> 00:25:24,987
- Okay, great. Is your wife gonna meet you?
- No.

405
00:25:24,988 --> 00:25:27,553
Your girlfriend?

406
00:25:27,815 --> 00:25:31,077
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

407
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,207
- You're just by yourself?
- Yeah.

408
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:36,555
Sucks.

409
00:25:36,556 --> 00:25:40,121
Okay, so just one. Here's your wine list
and your menu. Come on.

410
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,687
Do you want, like, a magazine
or something?

411
00:25:41,688 --> 00:25:43,949
It's gonna be boring
if you're just sitting by yourself.

412
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,210
I'll be all right. Thank you.

413
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,602
I just would be so depressed.

414
00:25:47,603 --> 00:25:49,080
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

415
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:51,037
Thank you.

416
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:54,691
The best thing is,
you have the greatest table in the house.

417
00:25:54,692 --> 00:25:56,996
- Oh, yeah?
- That's Aldous Snow right there.

418
00:25:56,997 --> 00:25:59,388
I know. I know, dude. I know.

419
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:02,390
- I'm gonna ask him. I'll ask him politely.
- No, please don't, please.

420
00:26:02,606 --> 00:26:04,650
Mate!

421
00:26:04,912 --> 00:26:07,303
Why don't you come over and sit with us?
You'll be very welcome.

422
00:26:07,304 --> 00:26:11,565
No, thank you. I need a drink.

423
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:14,000
Would you guys like a drink?

424
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:16,610
Well, no, actually, because...

425
00:26:16,611 --> 00:26:20,263
Seven years clean.
That's what this tattoo denotes.

426
00:26:20,264 --> 00:26:22,741
Seven years free from drugs and alcohol.

427
00:26:22,742 --> 00:26:25,047
If I have just one sip of wine,

428
00:26:25,048 --> 00:26:29,092
by the end of the evening, I'll be,
like, rimming waiters for their tips

429
00:26:29,093 --> 00:26:30,352
just to get me hands on a rock.

430
00:26:30,353 --> 00:26:33,441
You know what I mean? Nasty.

431
00:26:33,615 --> 00:26:36,702
- I heard that.
- Hey, what's up, man?

432
00:26:36,703 --> 00:26:38,616
How are you enjoying
your vegetable medley?

433
00:26:38,617 --> 00:26:40,703
It's mundane.

434
00:26:40,704 --> 00:26:43,312
It is mundane. It's great, I know.

435
00:26:43,313 --> 00:26:45,269
Will you marry me?

436
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,357
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Yes!

437
00:26:47,358 --> 00:26:49,749
- She said yes!
- Beautiful.

438
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,098
Congratulations!

439
00:26:54,229 --> 00:26:58,187
I'm so excited! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

440
00:26:58,188 --> 00:27:00,362
Peter!

441
00:27:02,058 --> 00:27:04,057
What's up?

442
00:27:04,058 --> 00:27:06,232
- Are you doing okay?
- Yeah.

443
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:08,798
Yeah, I'm good.

444
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:12,886
Look, did you follow me here?
Did my assistant tell you I was coming?

445
00:27:12,887 --> 00:27:14,364
- No.
- Did you talk to her?

446
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:18,757
No, I didn't talk to your assistant.
It's not all about you, you know.

447
00:27:18,758 --> 00:27:23,758
Hawaii is a beautiful place.
People come here, usually not to follow you.

448
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:26,585
So you're really staying?
You're gonna stay?

449
00:27:26,586 --> 00:27:30,630
Yeah, I think so. I really like it here.
I feel at home here.

450
00:27:30,631 --> 00:27:33,109
I just love it.

451
00:27:33,327 --> 00:27:35,023
Yeah, you should stay.

452
00:27:35,024 --> 00:27:37,632
I appreciate your consideration.

453
00:27:37,633 --> 00:27:40,328
Sounds like Aldous probably
shared a lot of needles,

454
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:42,938
so thank you for dating him after me.

455
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:45,504
- I appreciate that.
- Hmm.

456
00:27:45,852 --> 00:27:49,940
- Hope you have a really good time here.
- Have a great dinner.

457
00:27:49,941 --> 00:27:52,159
Thank you.

458
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,420
Groupie whore.

459
00:27:54,421 --> 00:27:56,507
Psycho stalker.

460
00:27:56,508 --> 00:28:02,074
You know what? It's vacation. I think
I'll just take a piסa colada, please.

461
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,789
Look at this guy.

462
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,399
Look at this guy.

463
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:18,600
Not us, buddy. Right? Not us.

464
00:28:18,601 --> 00:28:23,340
<i>I'm on Sex and the City.
What's up, Miranda?</i>

465
00:28:23,384 --> 00:28:27,558
I'm Samantha. I have sex with everyone.

466
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:29,646
Maybe it's a good thing that they're here.

467
00:28:29,647 --> 00:28:32,691
You know what I mean?
Maybe this is a challenge from God

468
00:28:32,692 --> 00:28:34,865
for me to forget her. You know?

469
00:28:34,866 --> 00:28:39,953
Or maybe it's a sign from God
that you should be with her.

470
00:28:39,954 --> 00:28:42,171
I love her show.

471
00:28:42,172 --> 00:28:45,607
When they mix the sexuality
and the violence, I like it.

472
00:28:45,608 --> 00:28:47,999
What the hell is wrong with you two?
You gotta move on.

473
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,304
I hear you say that, but it's not that easy.

474
00:28:50,305 --> 00:28:52,609
It's that easy. Promise you it is.

475
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,479
I lived in South Central.

476
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,262
South Central. And I hated it.

477
00:28:57,263 --> 00:28:58,654
That's why I moved to Oahu.

478
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:01,046
Now I can name you
over 200 different kinds of fish.

479
00:29:01,047 --> 00:29:02,786
- No, you can't.
- Oh, yes, I can.

480
00:29:02,787 --> 00:29:04,264
- Do it.
- Yeah, you cannot.

481
00:29:04,265 --> 00:29:09,483
G. Ghost pipefish, grill fish, goaler fish
grouper fish, greenback...

482
00:29:09,484 --> 00:29:11,266
What's the state fish of Hawaii?

483
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:13,006
Humuhumunukunukuapua'a.

484
00:29:13,007 --> 00:29:15,441
- Yeah, bitch.
- Hey.

485
00:29:15,442 --> 00:29:19,052
- You ready?
- Yeah, just gonna close up.

486
00:29:20,965 --> 00:29:25,314
Hello, Mr Bretter, Mr Brayden.
Where's your wife, sir?

487
00:29:25,315 --> 00:29:27,749
She is in bed.

488
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,793
How are things going with the lady?

489
00:29:29,794 --> 00:29:34,838
<i>Not awesome.
She's complicated, like The Da Vinci Code,</i>

490
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:38,623
you know, but harder to crack.

491
00:29:38,971 --> 00:29:43,842
But life is full of lessons.
You learn something new every day.

492
00:29:44,537 --> 00:29:48,234
Wonder what I'm going to learn tomorrow.

493
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:50,451
Well.

494
00:29:50,452 --> 00:29:52,017
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

495
00:29:52,018 --> 00:29:53,191
Good night, sir.

496
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:56,888
Off to find the mythical clitoris.

497
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:03,455
So, Peter, were you able to get
that crying lady out of your room?

498
00:30:03,717 --> 00:30:05,281
'Cause I could send someone up,
if you want.

499
00:30:05,282 --> 00:30:07,891
- Oh, you could?
- Yeah.

500
00:30:07,892 --> 00:30:11,588
That's very funny. It is.

501
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:16,023
Well, listen, Sarah Marshall Show sucks.
Who cares?

502
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:19,634
I do the music for that programme.

503
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:23,374
Did I mention that the music rocks?

504
00:30:23,939 --> 00:30:27,679
That's very sweet of you.
That's very sweet of you to say.

505
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,853
You don't have to say that, though.
It's not music.

506
00:30:29,854 --> 00:30:32,593
There's no melody, it's just tones.

507
00:30:32,594 --> 00:30:35,682
Just dark, ominous tones.

508
00:30:36,465 --> 00:30:39,681
"The masturbating dog killer
is on the loose again.

509
00:30:39,682 --> 00:30:43,379
"He'll kill the owner,
but at least the dogs are happy. "

510
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:52,991
I'm no Aldous Snow, I guess, you know.

511
00:30:56,861 --> 00:30:59,992
<i>Time to start the music</i>

512
00:30:59,993 --> 00:31:02,514
<i>All gonna light the light</i>

513
00:31:02,515 --> 00:31:07,473
<i>Yeah, yeah, gonna get things started
on The Muppet Show tonight</i>

514
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:17,780
- Whipped cream or berry?
- Whipped cream.

515
00:31:18,563 --> 00:31:22,215
Here we are, sir.
Have a wonderful breakfast.

516
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:24,737
What a lovely table, so close to the buffet.

517
00:31:24,738 --> 00:31:28,130
<i>I'm glad you like it. Mahalo.</i>

518
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,957
Good morning, sir.
Can I start you with anything?

519
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:34,305
Orange juice, coffee?

520
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:37,872
What about, like, some pineapple juice
with a little bit of rum on the side.

521
00:31:37,873 --> 00:31:41,916
Of course. I like your style. Cocktail guy.

522
00:31:41,917 --> 00:31:44,004
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

523
00:31:44,005 --> 00:31:46,005
We've already reserved
the sea kayak for noon.

524
00:31:46,006 --> 00:31:49,006
Honey, I know that,
but you know that I wanted to see...

525
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:52,658
- Hey. Hello there, friend.
- Hey.

526
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:55,181
How are you guys? How was your evening?

527
00:31:55,182 --> 00:31:56,833
- Great.
- Awesome.

528
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:59,878
- I can't feel anything.
- All right.

529
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:02,357
- Does that feel good?
- I still can't feel anything.

530
00:32:02,358 --> 00:32:04,662
Okay, 'cause it hurts me.

531
00:32:04,663 --> 00:32:08,402
- Would you do that for me?
- Yeah.

532
00:32:08,403 --> 00:32:12,708
- Yeah.
- No, no, no. No.

533
00:32:12,709 --> 00:32:16,622
God put our mouths on our head
for a reason. No!

534
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:21,493
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Okay.

535
00:32:21,537 --> 00:32:27,452
- Is everything okay with...
- Waffles.

536
00:32:30,018 --> 00:32:33,453
- Here you go, sir. Breakfast of champions.
- Oh, thank you.

537
00:32:33,454 --> 00:32:39,020
And don't tell anybody, but...
A little extra love for you.

538
00:32:39,803 --> 00:32:41,064
Thank you.

539
00:32:41,065 --> 00:32:44,457
- Take it easy.
- You, too.

540
00:32:56,068 --> 00:32:58,025
- Hi.
- Hi.

541
00:32:58,026 --> 00:32:59,503
This is the yoga place, yeah?

542
00:32:59,504 --> 00:33:03,591
Yes. But there's no alcohol allowed
in the studio.

543
00:33:03,592 --> 00:33:08,724
Oh, no, I mean, obviously.
This is just pineapple juice.

544
00:33:08,985 --> 00:33:13,377
Well, there's no outside drinks
allowed in the studio.

545
00:33:13,378 --> 00:33:14,942
- Can I set it down?
- Sure.

546
00:33:14,943 --> 00:33:17,247
- Cool, thank you.
- I like your hat.

547
00:33:17,248 --> 00:33:21,379
- Thank you.
- Please remove it before class.

548
00:33:23,076 --> 00:33:27,207
Hey, everyone,
why don't you all grab your mats?

549
00:33:28,164 --> 00:33:32,643
<i>Sorry, I recognise you from the cover
of Namaste Magazine. I'm a huge fan.</i>

550
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:35,078
Thank you. That's so sweet of you to say.

551
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:38,905
I appreciate that.
Obviously, I don't do yoga for recognition.

552
00:33:38,906 --> 00:33:43,777
Right, of course you wouldn't.
Then stop being so good at it.

553
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:48,169
That's very flexible. That's nice.

554
00:33:49,344 --> 00:33:52,691
- And, you, I recognise you from your show.
- Thank you.

555
00:33:52,692 --> 00:33:56,041
You seem much taller on your show.

556
00:33:56,042 --> 00:33:59,216
- I'm not.
- No, I know.

557
00:34:00,391 --> 00:34:03,956
Okay, if you just wanna start
by bringing your palms into your chest.

558
00:34:03,957 --> 00:34:07,783
Today we're gonna start with
the Surya Namaskar, or Sun Salutation.

559
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:10,523
Let's take a deep inale in.

560
00:34:10,524 --> 00:34:12,697
Exhale and release the hands.

561
00:34:12,698 --> 00:34:16,525
Inale, arms up to the sky. Continue.

562
00:34:16,569 --> 00:34:20,221
Good, exhale and folding forward.

563
00:34:20,222 --> 00:34:24,483
Strong, strong backs. Good, excellent.

564
00:34:24,484 --> 00:34:26,484
Remember this is not a competition,

565
00:34:26,485 --> 00:34:28,962
although you two seem
to be the best in the class.

566
00:34:28,963 --> 00:34:31,485
Excellent. Perfect form, you two, perfect.

567
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,790
Coming up into downward-facing dog.

568
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:37,226
Good. It's really important in this pose,

569
00:34:37,227 --> 00:34:40,530
that you arch your back
and keep it flat at the same time.

570
00:34:40,531 --> 00:34:43,271
I feel like those are opposing ideas.

571
00:34:43,272 --> 00:34:47,533
No, they're not, 'cause you're arching
your back up while it's flat.

572
00:34:47,534 --> 00:34:49,665
Okay.

573
00:34:51,187 --> 00:34:55,665
Good, yeah, sweat it out.
Sweat out all the toxins from this morning.

574
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:57,971
- Come on, lady.
- My name is Prana,

575
00:34:57,972 --> 00:35:00,449
and I know that wasn't just juice.

576
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:05,581
You don't really need any adjusting,
so I'm just gonna do this for myself.

577
00:35:05,582 --> 00:35:07,973
Just to learn from your body,

578
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:10,452
memorize your body.

579
00:35:10,453 --> 00:35:14,018
- Good. Strong legs.
- Come on.

580
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:16,932
Perfect skin and form.

581
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:20,151
Okay, class, I'd like to now
move into a tripod headstand.

582
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:22,064
This is more of an advanced pose,

583
00:35:22,065 --> 00:35:24,847
so if you don't feel comfortable
or strong enough,

584
00:35:24,848 --> 00:35:28,718
please feel free to just lay on your mat
in child's pose.

585
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:30,196
I got it.

586
00:35:30,197 --> 00:35:33,415
All right, so let's all
come down to our mats.

587
00:35:33,416 --> 00:35:36,633
Get in a prep position
for the tripod headstand.

588
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,895
If you don't feel comfortable,

589
00:35:37,896 --> 00:35:41,112
there's no shame
in just laying on your mat in child's pose.

590
00:35:41,113 --> 00:35:42,679
Lady, I got it.

591
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,593
Good, so let's prep to come up. Good.

592
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:50,202
Sir, if you just want to lay down
in child's pose.

593
00:35:50,203 --> 00:35:51,333
Now, you all heard me say,

594
00:35:51,334 --> 00:35:54,464
"If you want to be in child's pose,
that's okay. "

595
00:35:54,465 --> 00:35:56,682
- Just in case he gets hurt.
- Bring it, bring it.

596
00:35:56,683 --> 00:35:59,074
I don't want you to break your neck.

597
00:35:59,075 --> 00:36:00,727
- What's up?
- Just relax.

598
00:36:00,728 --> 00:36:02,727
My legs, that's what.

599
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:04,989
We're doing quiet headstands today.

600
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:08,033
I'm doing a handstand, motherfucker!
I'm doing a handstand.

601
00:36:08,034 --> 00:36:09,816
Okay, you know, why don't we just release.

602
00:36:09,817 --> 00:36:11,469
Thank God.

603
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:14,993
Good, everybody. Good.

604
00:36:18,254 --> 00:36:19,689
Hey.

605
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,254
Are you Chuck?

606
00:36:21,255 --> 00:36:24,908
Oh, man, you know,
they won't change that flyer.

607
00:36:24,909 --> 00:36:28,691
That's my mainland name.
My Hawaiian name is Koonu.

608
00:36:28,692 --> 00:36:30,127
Cool, sorry.

609
00:36:30,128 --> 00:36:31,387
No, it's all good.

610
00:36:31,388 --> 00:36:34,519
Does Koonu have some, like,
cool Hawaiian meaning?

611
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,476
It means Chuck.

612
00:36:36,477 --> 00:36:38,172
I plugged it into a database.

613
00:36:38,173 --> 00:36:41,520
There's a thing you can go on,
on the Internet, you just type in your name,

614
00:36:41,521 --> 00:36:43,565
and it just says it.

615
00:36:44,609 --> 00:36:45,783
What's your name?

616
00:36:45,784 --> 00:36:47,131
- I'm Peter.
- Peter.

617
00:36:47,132 --> 00:36:48,783
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna give you a Hawaiian name.

618
00:36:48,784 --> 00:36:51,046
Oh, great.

619
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:55,960
Pepiopi.

620
00:36:57,265 --> 00:36:59,656
- Great.
- Pepiopi, looks like you've got a little pain

621
00:36:59,657 --> 00:37:02,397
behind those eyes.

622
00:37:02,962 --> 00:37:05,571
Yeah, maybe a little.

623
00:37:05,572 --> 00:37:07,789
There's really only one cure for that.

624
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:08,919
What's that?

625
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,573
Weed. You got any?

626
00:37:12,878 --> 00:37:16,270
- No.
- Well, then let's go surfing.

627
00:37:18,401 --> 00:37:21,749
Okay, when we're out there,
I want you to ignore your instincts.

628
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,967
I'm gonna be your instincts.
Koonu will be your instincts.

629
00:37:24,968 --> 00:37:26,446
Don't do anything.

630
00:37:26,447 --> 00:37:29,794
Don't try to surf, don't do it.

631
00:37:29,795 --> 00:37:32,186
The less you do, the more you do.

632
00:37:32,187 --> 00:37:35,493
Let's see you pop up. Pop it up!

633
00:37:38,537 --> 00:37:39,797
That's not it at all.

634
00:37:39,798 --> 00:37:42,234
Do less. Get down. Try less. Do it again.

635
00:37:43,538 --> 00:37:45,408
Pop up.

636
00:37:45,409 --> 00:37:47,191
No, too slow. Do less.

637
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,574
Pop up.

638
00:37:49,275 --> 00:37:50,104
Pop up.

639
00:37:50,105 --> 00:37:52,496
You're doing too much. Do less. Pop down.

640
00:37:52,497 --> 00:37:53,845
Pop up now.

641
00:37:53,846 --> 00:37:55,323
Stop! Get down. Get down there.

642
00:37:55,324 --> 00:37:58,150
Remember, don't do anything.

643
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,717
Nothing. Pop up.

644
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:04,065
Well, you...
No, you gotta do more than that,

645
00:38:04,066 --> 00:38:05,326
'cause you're just laying right out.

646
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:06,500
It looks like you're boogie-boarding.

647
00:38:06,501 --> 00:38:09,589
Just do it. Feel it. Pop up.

648
00:38:10,241 --> 00:38:13,241
Yeah. That wasn't quite it,
but we're gonna figure it out, out there.

649
00:38:13,242 --> 00:38:14,415
Let's go surfing, come on.

650
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:16,503
Everybody's learning how, come on and...

651
00:38:16,504 --> 00:38:19,809
<i>The weather outside is weather</i>

652
00:38:20,462 --> 00:38:22,635
How long you lived out here?

653
00:38:22,636 --> 00:38:25,680
Man, I don't know. I quit wearing a watch
when I moved out here.

654
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:28,158
- Wow, that's so cool.
- Yeah.

655
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:32,334
No, like my cell phone has a clock on it,
so I don't really need it.

656
00:38:32,335 --> 00:38:35,683
Right, so it's basically the same thing.

657
00:38:35,684 --> 00:38:39,031
- How old are you?
- I don't really believe in age or numbers,

658
00:38:39,032 --> 00:38:41,945
you know, I don't...
I mean, if you had to put a number on it,

659
00:38:41,946 --> 00:38:45,338
I guess I'd be 44.

660
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:48,599
Fuck!

661
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,905
Thanks for taking me out here.

662
00:38:52,036 --> 00:38:55,166
This is the first time I've felt good
in three weeks or so.

663
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,906
You need to get back on that board
is what you need to do.

664
00:38:57,907 --> 00:38:59,863
- Yeah?
- Hey, here's the deal.

665
00:38:59,864 --> 00:39:01,429
When life gives you lemons,

666
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,734
just say, "Fuck the lemons," and bail.

667
00:39:03,735 --> 00:39:06,561
Yeah. No. You said it, totally.

668
00:39:06,562 --> 00:39:08,735
You gotta just pull yourself up
by your wetsuit,

669
00:39:08,736 --> 00:39:09,865
get back on that board...

670
00:39:09,866 --> 00:39:11,562
Hey, look, man,
if you're attacked by a shark,

671
00:39:11,563 --> 00:39:13,128
are you gonna give up surfing?

672
00:39:13,129 --> 00:39:14,867
Probably, yeah.

673
00:39:14,868 --> 00:39:18,347
Let's go in, all right. Tacos are on me.

674
00:39:18,348 --> 00:39:20,825
Can you try to listen
to what I'm saying to you, Brian?

675
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:23,434
I'm confused and I don't know what to do.

676
00:39:23,435 --> 00:39:24,914
<i>What's up with that hat?</i>

677
00:39:24,915 --> 00:39:27,609
<i>What are you
in the Buena Vista Social Club?</i>

678
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:28,871
This is a nice hat.

679
00:39:28,872 --> 00:39:31,784
<i>What member of the Brat Pack are you?</i>

680
00:39:31,785 --> 00:39:34,785
<i>You look like one of those guys
suspected of killing JFK.</i>

681
00:39:34,786 --> 00:39:37,177
That's very funny. That's great.

682
00:39:37,178 --> 00:39:39,483
<i>Tell him to make friends.</i>

683
00:39:39,484 --> 00:39:42,005
<i>You need to get out there
and make some friends, man.</i>

684
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:43,658
Is Liz there right now?

685
00:39:43,659 --> 00:39:45,832
<i>No, no, she's not in here, buddy.</i>

686
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:47,094
I just heard her.

687
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:49,093
<i>She's gone.</i>

688
00:39:49,094 --> 00:39:51,181
Who are you looking at?

689
00:39:51,182 --> 00:39:52,312
<i>What?</i>

690
00:39:52,313 --> 00:39:54,095
Is she still... Hi, Liz.

691
00:39:54,096 --> 00:39:58,270
<i>No. I swear on my mother's grave, it...
Okay, it was Liz.</i>

692
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:00,358
<i>She wasn't here the entire time.</i>

693
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:02,662
<i>Go out and meet people.
We meet people all the time...</i>

694
00:40:02,663 --> 00:40:04,185
<i>- All the time on vacation.
- Constantly.</i>

695
00:40:04,186 --> 00:40:07,316
I've tried, all right,
there's a couple of dudes here,

696
00:40:07,317 --> 00:40:09,752
but they're kind of weird.

697
00:40:09,753 --> 00:40:11,709
<i>Just be friendly.</i>

698
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,970
<i>Iron your shirt.</i>

699
00:40:12,971 --> 00:40:14,536
<i>Iron your shirt, look sharp.</i>

700
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,623
<i>Even your T-shirts.</i>

701
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:19,972
There is this girl at the front desk
who's pretty cute.

702
00:40:19,973 --> 00:40:22,886
<i>Oh, yeah. You know what?
Go have another dirty one night stand.</i>

703
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,756
<i>That worked out so well before.</i>

704
00:40:24,757 --> 00:40:27,757
What do you want from me?
You just told me I need to meet people.

705
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,366
<i>Ask her out.
Maybe that's what he needs, is a rebound.</i>

706
00:40:30,367 --> 00:40:32,454
<i>He's had plenty of chances
for rebounds. This isn't...</i>

707
00:40:32,455 --> 00:40:33,715
<i>Can we get on the same team here?</i>

708
00:40:33,716 --> 00:40:37,760
<i>Okay, I'm sorry.
We're on the same team. Sorry.</i>

709
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:39,847
<i>You should go on a date with this girl.</i>

710
00:40:39,848 --> 00:40:41,325
Well, maybe I'll ask her out then.

711
00:40:41,326 --> 00:40:43,631
<i>- Yes.
- My wife says so.</i>

712
00:40:43,632 --> 00:40:46,849
<i>- Hey, I'm in Hawaii, too!
- Oh, that's neat.</i>

713
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:49,633
<i>Aloha, bitches!</i>

714
00:40:49,677 --> 00:40:52,243
That's very cool.

715
00:40:54,461 --> 00:40:57,983
They're not Native Americans, Brian.

716
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:00,722
<i>- Bri...
- What are you doing?</i>

717
00:41:00,723 --> 00:41:03,028
<i>- The luha. Is that right?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

718
00:41:03,029 --> 00:41:04,376
<i>It's called the hula.</i>

719
00:41:04,377 --> 00:41:06,245
<i>- Luau?
- No, hula.</i>

720
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:08,204
<i>You're doing a luau?</i>

721
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:22,946
- Hey.
- Hey.

722
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:25,077
- Peter.
- Wow.

723
00:41:25,643 --> 00:41:28,860
You look beautiful.
I mean, that's a beautiful dress.

724
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,035
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

725
00:41:30,036 --> 00:41:31,470
This'll be fun.

726
00:41:31,471 --> 00:41:33,645
<i>Lei?</i>

727
00:41:37,342 --> 00:41:40,341
May I help you with something else, Peter?

728
00:41:40,342 --> 00:41:42,429
No, I'll just grab a drink.
I'm just gonna head inside.

729
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:45,822
- Happy 4th of July!
- Thank you.

730
00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:49,171
<i>Aloha!</i>

731
00:42:02,045 --> 00:42:04,131
- You done here?
- No, actually, I just sat down,

732
00:42:04,132 --> 00:42:06,088
I'm just getting started.
It's delicious, though, thank you.

733
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:08,176
I'll just go fuck myself.

734
00:42:08,177 --> 00:42:10,960
<i>- Sorry, what?
- Mahalo.</i>

735
00:42:13,004 --> 00:42:15,221
Hi, Peter.

736
00:42:16,092 --> 00:42:18,657
Hey. Hey, bro.

737
00:42:19,658 --> 00:42:21,310
- Hi.
- Hey, all right.

738
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,180
Excuse me. Excuse me.

739
00:42:23,181 --> 00:42:26,441
Everybody, can I have your attention
for one second, please.

740
00:42:26,442 --> 00:42:29,442
We have a very special guest
with us here, today.

741
00:42:29,443 --> 00:42:34,444
He is the lead singer
of the band, Infant Sorrow,

742
00:42:34,445 --> 00:42:39,011
one of my favourite musicians of all time.
He's so awesome.

743
00:42:39,055 --> 00:42:41,750
Please, please, let's take...

744
00:42:41,751 --> 00:42:46,926
Let's see if we can get him up here,
Mr Aldous Snow. Please, come on.

745
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:48,143
Share your gift.

746
00:42:48,144 --> 00:42:49,492
Duty calls and all that.

747
00:42:49,493 --> 00:42:53,449
I'm trying to be incognito, it's weird.
It's like work to me, this is no fun.

748
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:56,016
Hey! Thank you!

749
00:43:03,757 --> 00:43:06,366
Thank you.
What a lovely introduction.

750
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,888
What an eccentric and confident young man.

751
00:43:08,889 --> 00:43:12,541
I'd like to dedicate this song
to a very beautiful woman that's here today.

752
00:43:12,542 --> 00:43:16,151
It's Miss Sarah Marshall, there she is.

753
00:43:16,152 --> 00:43:18,326
Look at her, blimey!

754
00:43:25,764 --> 00:43:28,458
<i>Old as ancient skies</i>

755
00:43:28,459 --> 00:43:31,894
<i>I've had these wandering eyes</i>

756
00:43:31,895 --> 00:43:34,330

<i>Inside you</i>

760
00:43:43,908 --> 00:43:45,072
This went from 6:00 to midnight.

<i>Teach me how to grow

00:43:53,901 --> 00:43:57,206

00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,380

<i>Inside of you this king has found his queen</i>

768
00:44:20,387 --> 00:44:21,560
Hey.

769
00:44:21,561 --> 00:44:23,908
You're from the breakfast buffet, right?

770
00:44:23,909 --> 00:44:25,652
- Yeah.
- Whipped cream or berries?

771
00:44:25,653 --> 00:44:27,080
Yeah. Yeah, I'm Peter.

772
00:44:27,084 --> 00:44:27,996
- Kemo.
- Kemo.

773
00:44:27,997 --> 00:44:30,432
- Good to meet you, man.
- Good to meet, you, man.

774
00:44:30,433 --> 00:44:33,695
- Have a beer.
- Thanks. Thank you.

775
00:44:35,217 --> 00:44:36,781
Sarah Marshall.

776
00:44:36,782 --> 00:44:38,826
Yes.

777
00:44:39,479 --> 00:44:41,565
How do you know
I was dating Sarah Marshall?

778
00:44:41,566 --> 00:44:44,915
Dwayne told me. Chuck told me.

779
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:46,263
Even Rachel told me.

780
00:44:46,264 --> 00:44:50,655
I heard about it from everybody.
You gotta stop talking about it.

781
00:44:50,656 --> 00:44:52,916
<i>It's like The Sopranos.</i>

782
00:44:52,917 --> 00:44:54,830
It's over.

783
00:44:54,831 --> 00:44:57,483
Find a new show.

784
00:44:58,050 --> 00:44:59,918
You need a hug.

785
00:44:59,919 --> 00:45:02,398
Come here.

786
00:45:03,138 --> 00:45:04,702
Oh, thank you.

787
00:45:04,703 --> 00:45:07,486
You're awfully nice.

788
00:45:07,748 --> 00:45:10,574
<i>I gotta go.
I'm prepping the pig for tomorrow's luau.</i>

789
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:13,487
You should come and help me.
It'll take your mind off of things.

790
00:45:13,488 --> 00:45:15,879
- Yeah? You don't mind?
- No.

791
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,010
I mean, I must say I'm a pretty good cook.

792
00:45:19,011 --> 00:45:21,273
All right!

793
00:45:23,491 --> 00:45:26,404
I can't! Please don't make me do this!

794
00:45:26,405 --> 00:45:27,535
Do it!

795
00:45:27,536 --> 00:45:31,058
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

796
00:45:34,842 --> 00:45:36,624
You can stop crying now.

797
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:38,712
He's dead already.

798
00:45:38,713 --> 00:45:40,278
I'm not crying.

799
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,756
You should stop crying.

800
00:45:41,757 --> 00:45:43,409
I don't cry. I'm not a baby.

801
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:46,627
Really?
'Cause you look like a gigantic baby.

802
00:45:46,628 --> 00:45:50,237
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that at all.

803
00:45:58,935 --> 00:46:00,413
Hey.

804
00:46:00,414 --> 00:46:04,980
Listen, would you like to hang out tonight,
like, not in an official hotel function?

805
00:46:04,981 --> 00:46:06,458
Yeah. Totally.

806
00:46:06,459 --> 00:46:09,067
A bunch of us are going to go to this,
like, little beach thing afterwards.

807
00:46:09,068 --> 00:46:11,851
You're totally welcome to come.

808
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,765
Maybe we could go together?

809
00:46:13,766 --> 00:46:15,634
Yeah, whatever.

810
00:46:15,635 --> 00:46:17,070
I mean we don't have to,
if you don't want to,

811
00:46:17,071 --> 00:46:18,114
I just thought that maybe...

812
00:46:18,115 --> 00:46:19,679
No, listen,
you don't have to make this weird.

813
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,463
You either want to go or you don't.

814
00:46:23,029 --> 00:46:25,333
- I would love to.
- Okay.

815
00:46:25,334 --> 00:46:28,117
Awesome. Why don't you go upstairs,
change that shirt,

816
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:31,857
and I'll meet you out front in, like, five?

817
00:46:40,947 --> 00:46:45,079
- This is so cool.
- You like it?

818
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:00,300
So what brought you to Hawaii?

819
00:47:00,649 --> 00:47:03,082
- A dude.
- Of course.

820
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:07,302
A surfer dude. You know, WCT, top 44.

821
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:11,782
Totally.

822
00:47:12,565 --> 00:47:15,260
We were together for two years.

823
00:47:15,261 --> 00:47:18,087
Dropped out of school,
moved out here with him.

824
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:20,392
Three weeks later,
I caught him cheating on me,

825
00:47:20,393 --> 00:47:23,654
so I moved out, and that's that.

826
00:47:23,698 --> 00:47:26,219
What an asshole.

827
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,787
No, he's just a boy.

828
00:47:30,265 --> 00:47:35,136
You ever think about going back home,
finishing school, or...

829
00:47:35,484 --> 00:47:37,266
No.

830
00:47:37,267 --> 00:47:40,268
No. I work at the hotel,

831
00:47:40,312 --> 00:47:44,008
doesn't really have to be a future in there.

832
00:47:44,356 --> 00:47:46,225
Okay, my turn.

833
00:47:46,226 --> 00:47:48,226
Okay.

834
00:47:48,227 --> 00:47:53,402
So, how do you like
writing music for a TV show?

835
00:47:55,402 --> 00:47:57,793
It's great, you know. People are great.

836
00:47:57,794 --> 00:48:00,924
It's great to have a steady paycheque.
It's... I'm very lucky.

837
00:48:00,925 --> 00:48:02,186
Oh, my God, you hate it.

838
00:48:02,187 --> 00:48:04,708
I fucking hate it so much.

839
00:48:04,709 --> 00:48:07,971
So then, do something about it.

840
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:11,884
Excuse me.

841
00:48:11,885 --> 00:48:15,102
I'm just saying, if you hate something,
change it.

842
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,800
- Don't dwell.
- Well, I'm trying.

843
00:48:18,887 --> 00:48:22,496
I'm actually working on a rock opera.

844
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,976
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

845
00:48:25,324 --> 00:48:28,542
What's your rock opera about?

846
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,282
Dracula.

847
00:48:32,761 --> 00:48:35,673
Yeah, and eternal love, you know.
That's the theme.

848
00:48:35,674 --> 00:48:39,631
But I think the two sort of go hand in hand,
you know?

849
00:48:39,632 --> 00:48:41,893
And I...

850
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:46,981
I have this vision of doing it with puppets.

851
00:48:48,808 --> 00:48:51,591
I mean, humans also, you know.

852
00:48:53,071 --> 00:48:54,548
Why Dracula?

853
00:48:54,549 --> 00:48:58,505
Because he's a man like anyone else.
He just wants to be loved.

854
00:48:58,506 --> 00:49:00,376
And every time he gets close
to a human woman,

855
00:49:00,377 --> 00:49:02,029
he ends up smothering and killing her,

856
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:04,768
which is a feeling I am familiar with.

857
00:49:04,769 --> 00:49:06,856
What? That's just a joke.

858
00:49:06,857 --> 00:49:09,465
- Oh, shit.
- What?

859
00:49:09,466 --> 00:49:13,467
My ex. If I run, you run.

860
00:49:14,033 --> 00:49:16,033
- Do you understand?
- No, I don't understand at all.

861
00:49:16,034 --> 00:49:17,902
Fucking motherfucker! Dipshit!

862
00:49:17,903 --> 00:49:19,033
Rachel, what are you doing?

863
00:49:19,034 --> 00:49:20,817
I thought I told you
to stay back on your island.

864
00:49:20,818 --> 00:49:21,947
Take it easy, just take it easy.

865
00:49:21,948 --> 00:49:23,209
Yeah, you know what?
The deal was over April 9.

866
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,513
Well, the deal's back on, motherfucker.

867
00:49:25,514 --> 00:49:27,600
You ain't the chief in this village.
I'm the chief.

868
00:49:27,601 --> 00:49:28,732
Of the idiots?

869
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:31,559
Rachel, let me handle this. I know
his friend. Let me handle this, okay?

870
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,863
Go ahead.

871
00:49:33,864 --> 00:49:36,038
Hey, man, you remember me from breakfast?

872
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:38,735
- Oh, yeah, the cocktail guy, that's right.
- Yeah.

873
00:49:38,736 --> 00:49:41,996
This ain't the breakfast buffet.
What, you with my girl?

874
00:49:41,997 --> 00:49:44,258
Keeping her warm for me at night, huh?

875
00:49:44,259 --> 00:49:47,259
Hey, what are you doing here?

876
00:49:50,304 --> 00:49:51,868
That's right. Just hit him!

877
00:49:51,869 --> 00:49:53,260
Rachel, we gotta get out of here. Rachel?

878
00:49:53,261 --> 00:49:56,305
You get what you deserve.

879
00:50:07,308 --> 00:50:11,091
Just a boy?
No, that dude was a fucking man.

880
00:50:11,092 --> 00:50:15,874
No, no, no. He's an asshole.
I can't believe I ever dated him.

881
00:50:15,875 --> 00:50:18,180
- You went nuts.
- Yeah.

882
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:21,267
You guys are dysfunctional.

883
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,790
<i>You were like one of those girls
from Flavour of Love.</i>

884
00:50:23,791 --> 00:50:25,269
- From what?
- You were.

885
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:28,140
"I'll kill you. I'll kill you. "

886
00:50:28,488 --> 00:50:30,444
Okay, I'm gonna go get us another round.

887
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:32,532
I'll grab it. It's no big deal.

888
00:50:32,533 --> 00:50:37,185
You don't have to dote on me.
I'm not that type of girl.

889
00:50:49,015 --> 00:50:50,711
You look so hot.

890
00:50:50,712 --> 00:50:53,189
<i>Give me Crime Scene.
Give me dirty Crime Scene girl.</i>

891
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,364
Andrי the Giant, out of the shot, please.

892
00:50:55,365 --> 00:50:58,365
Mutombo, out of the shot, come on.

893
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:29,286
Did you know that there's a picture
of you flashing,

894
00:51:29,287 --> 00:51:30,939
hanging in the men's room?

895
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:33,984
Yeah. I hate it so much.

896
00:51:33,985 --> 00:51:37,201
My jackass boyfriend made me do it.

897
00:51:37,202 --> 00:51:39,159
Keoki took it, right there.

898
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,376
And I asked him to take it down,

899
00:51:41,377 --> 00:51:45,813
but he said that it would ruin
the balance of the collage.

900
00:51:45,857 --> 00:51:47,639
Do you want me to try
to get it down for you?

901
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:52,294
No. No, no, no, he'll kill you.
Like, really kill you.

902
00:51:53,251 --> 00:51:56,077
But I have a surprise for you.

903
00:51:56,078 --> 00:51:57,425
Really, what?

904
00:51:57,426 --> 00:51:58,904
We're gonna take a quick break.

905
00:51:58,905 --> 00:52:00,991
Tonight we have a special guest
from the mainland,

906
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:04,122
singing a song from his Dracula musical,

907
00:52:04,123 --> 00:52:08,124
please welcome to the stage,
Mr Peter Bretter.

908
00:52:08,994 --> 00:52:10,255
Peter!

909
00:52:10,256 --> 00:52:12,038
Yeah! Go get them, tiger!

910
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:13,951
Please don't.

911
00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:15,864
Peter!

912
00:52:15,865 --> 00:52:19,301
- Rachel...
- Dracula! Peter!

913
00:52:23,693 --> 00:52:25,171
Get them!

914
00:52:25,172 --> 00:52:27,085
What's up?

915
00:52:32,783 --> 00:52:35,131
Thank you.

916
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:38,523
You know, I could play something else.

917
00:52:38,524 --> 00:52:40,175
I just think out of context this might be...

918
00:52:40,176 --> 00:52:42,742
Dracula musical!

919
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:46,091
Thank you.

920

00:53:59,633 --> 00:54:02,416
<i>How much I love you</i>

929
00:54:09,114 --> 00:54:10,501
<i>Die</i>

930
00:54:11,202 --> 00:54:13,246
<i>Die</i>

931
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,464
<i>Die</i>

932
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:21,160
<i>I can't</i>

933
00:54:31,773 --> 00:54:33,641
Awesome!

934
00:54:33,642 --> 00:54:36,077
Thank you.

935
00:54:39,035 --> 00:54:40,426
Thank you.

936
00:54:40,427 --> 00:54:43,514
So, I had a really,
really great time tonight.

937
00:54:43,515 --> 00:54:45,818
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I mean, it got a little wild.

938
00:54:45,819 --> 00:54:47,819
- "A little"? You can say that.
- Yeah.

939
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,602
But it was really fun,
and you're so cool, and it was...

940
00:54:50,603 --> 00:54:52,385
Thank you for taking me out.

941
00:54:52,386 --> 00:54:55,083
No, I had a great time. Thank you.

942
00:54:55,822 --> 00:54:58,388
- You did?
- Yeah.

943
00:55:01,563 --> 00:55:03,780
I'm sorry.

944
00:55:03,781 --> 00:55:08,042
I'm sorry, I just... I don't...
I just don't wanna complicate things.

945
00:55:08,043 --> 00:55:09,478
- No, of course!
- Yeah?

946
00:55:09,479 --> 00:55:12,826
No, no, no. Totally. I totally get that.

947
00:55:12,827 --> 00:55:15,044
- I had a great time.
- A handshake?

948
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:18,349
- Well, I don't know. Okay.
- All right, all right.

949
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:21,960
- All right. Get home safe.
- You, too.

950
00:55:24,091 --> 00:55:27,091
- Thanks again.
- Bye.

951
00:55:33,355 --> 00:55:37,137
<i>I'm on a hammock with me lady</i>

952
00:55:37,138 --> 00:55:41,487
<i>Watching the sea roll by</i>

953
00:55:42,749 --> 00:55:45,487
<i>Things have been great now</i>

954
00:55:45,488 --> 00:55:49,707
<i>'Cause we're in Hawaii</i>

955
00:55:50,576 --> 00:55:53,055
Hey, guys.

956
00:55:53,186 --> 00:55:56,229
Hey, man. I'm Koonu.

957
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:59,534
Yeah. No, I remember. I'm Peter.
We took a surf lesson together.

958
00:55:59,535 --> 00:56:03,101
Yeah, you're that guy
that works with Kaiser Permanente.

959
00:56:03,102 --> 00:56:06,754
No, I'm Peter.
We had a nice talk out on the water.

960
00:56:06,755 --> 00:56:09,190
That's cool.

961
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,494
Okay, can I just say something?

962
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:16,018
- I went on a date tonight with Rachel, right?
- That wasn't a date.

963
00:56:16,019 --> 00:56:18,105
She's in customer service, dude.

964
00:56:18,106 --> 00:56:20,279
She took you out for charity.

965
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:24,672
It was a date, okay? Trust me.
I know a date, and that was a date.

966
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:26,933
I bet you think strippers like you, too.

967
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:28,878
- That's really not necessary.
- It's true.

968
00:56:28,935 --> 00:56:32,065
Don't waste your time, man.
Believe me, it is a nowhere road. I know.

969
00:56:32,066 --> 00:56:35,110
Did you see her ex-boyfriend?
He is ridiculous.

970
00:56:35,111 --> 00:56:37,501
Who, Greg? I love Greg, man.

971
00:56:37,502 --> 00:56:40,329
I saw him beat up a guy with a starfish.

972
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:43,460
- Okay, that's just ridiculous.
- That guy was me.

973
00:56:43,461 --> 00:56:46,460
Dude, my homie over here,
on his honeymoon?

974
00:56:46,461 --> 00:56:49,070
Getting as much sex
as he possibly can ever have.

975
00:56:49,071 --> 00:56:50,940
Are you giving to her
hard and rough, dude?

976
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:53,419
Come on.

977
00:56:53,767 --> 00:56:59,712
The wife wants me to do certain things
that I find inappropriate.

978
00:56:59,813 --> 00:57:02,725
Let me just say
that if God was a city planner,

979
00:57:02,726 --> 00:57:07,510
he would not put a playground
next to a sewage system.

980
00:57:08,772 --> 00:57:12,946
We're trying to fuck,
but we're not having fun fucking.

981
00:57:12,947 --> 00:57:17,904
We're just, like...
I'm stabbing her private parts,

982
00:57:17,914 --> 00:57:22,966
and it's not fun, and it causes anxiety.
Fucking is...

983
00:57:23,167 --> 00:57:24,862
And then when you're not fucking...

984
00:57:24,863 --> 00:57:27,645
- Hey, someone's gotta stop him.
- You're the butt of a joke.

985
00:57:27,646 --> 00:57:30,255
Fucking this ring is...

986
00:57:30,256 --> 00:57:31,951
Fuck!

987
00:57:31,952 --> 00:57:35,039
It's gonna be all right.

988
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:38,040
Hi.

989
00:57:38,606 --> 00:57:41,128
Hi, do you wanna come back to bed?

990
00:57:41,129 --> 00:57:43,259
Sure.

991
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:47,522
Have fun.

992
00:57:48,087 --> 00:57:53,262
I like her hair.
I wonder if the carpet matches her pubes.

993
00:58:00,308 --> 00:58:03,048
Julian, what's up?

994
00:58:04,483 --> 00:58:06,396
Oh.

995
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,702
God.

996
00:58:17,921 --> 00:58:19,877
The show's been cancelled.

997
00:58:19,878 --> 00:58:21,791
That's good, 'cause that's what you wanted.

998
00:58:21,792 --> 00:58:25,271
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

999
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:30,837
It's just... I guess
I thought we had another year left.

1000
00:58:30,838 --> 00:58:33,142
It seems like we did, and...
This'll be good,

1001
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:36,360
'cause it's been a long-awaited transition
into film for me.

1002
00:58:36,361 --> 00:58:39,709
Don't get me wrong, but it's just...
It's a surprise.

1003
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:41,492
Come on tour with me.

1004
00:58:41,493 --> 00:58:46,363
I'll serenade you every night
in front of thousands of women.

1005
00:58:46,364 --> 00:58:48,277
I didn't know you were going on tour.

1006
00:58:48,278 --> 00:58:49,494
Yeah, I'm going in two weeks.

1007
00:58:49,495 --> 00:58:53,669
It's like an 18-month tour,
43 countries, Infant Sorrow,

1008
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:55,888
and it's gonna be a massive tour.

1009
00:58:55,889 --> 00:59:01,107
Yeah. I can't come 'cause I have a job.
I'm a working actress.

1010
00:59:01,108 --> 00:59:02,976
Not any more.

1011
00:59:02,977 --> 00:59:05,195
You're an unemployed actress, perfect.

1012
00:59:05,891 --> 00:59:10,369
You could be the queen of the groupies,
queen of the Sorrow Suckers.

1013
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:12,761
The Sorrow Suckers.

1014
00:59:12,762 --> 00:59:16,415
Sorrow Suckers.
I don't know why they call them that.

1015
00:59:16,416 --> 00:59:20,547
Mr and Mrs Snow, sorry.
Sorry to bother you.

1016
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,068
The hotel wanted to offer you
some complimentary coconut cake.

1017
00:59:23,069 --> 00:59:28,158
It's from the hotel. It's definitely
not from me personally, so...

1018
00:59:28,419 --> 00:59:30,593
- Yeah, thanks.
- Okay, great.

1019
00:59:30,594 --> 00:59:34,028
When were you planning on telling me this?

1020
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:37,769
- I just told you, then.
- Yeah. No, I know.

1021
00:59:37,770 --> 00:59:42,683
But telling me now
isn't really the same as telling me.

1022
00:59:42,684 --> 00:59:45,510
Well, look, you know,
I've not told you I've got genital herpes,

1023
00:59:45,511 --> 00:59:47,902
because it's not inflamed at the moment.

1024
00:59:47,903 --> 00:59:49,989
Do you guys want some champagne
with your cake,

1025
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:51,468
or do you want it without your cake?

1026
00:59:51,469 --> 00:59:54,034
I don't drink.

1027
01:00:00,515 --> 01:00:04,993
All right, so I came here
to give you my demo. I just...

1028
01:00:04,994 --> 01:00:08,100
I worship you,
and I just wanted to give you my demo.

1029
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:11,267
Just take a listen and...

1030
01:00:11,311 --> 01:00:13,398
Okay.

1031
01:00:13,399 --> 01:00:16,138
'Cause you know what?
You don't wanna be the guy sitting there,

1032
01:00:16,139 --> 01:00:18,834
watching BBC, and saying,

1033
01:00:18,835 --> 01:00:22,575
"Oh, I saw that guy! He was my waiter,

1034
01:00:22,576 --> 01:00:26,662
"and I totally dismissed him
like everyone else does in his life.

1035
01:00:26,663 --> 01:00:28,533
"And I totally was wrong,

1036
01:00:28,534 --> 01:00:32,185
"because he's a major, major,
major influence on me now,

1037
01:00:32,186 --> 01:00:34,753
"and I feel terrible!"

1038
01:00:37,405 --> 01:00:41,188
That stupid English voice, was that me?

1039
01:00:41,754 --> 01:00:44,451
Unfortunately, yes.

1040
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:47,712
You're really gonna like it.

1041
01:00:47,713 --> 01:00:51,539
I'll listen to it when you've gone.

1042
01:00:56,585 --> 01:01:00,498
Hey, look, just don't
tell anyone at the hotel.

1043
01:01:08,674 --> 01:01:10,849
- What's up, dude?
- What's up?

1044
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:15,676
Peter, I got some really interesting news
this morning.

1045
01:01:15,677 --> 01:01:17,632
Aldous gave you gonorrhoea?

1046
01:01:17,633 --> 01:01:20,764
No. Why would I tell you that?

1047
01:01:20,765 --> 01:01:23,374
<i>Crime Scene was cancelled.</i>

1048
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:25,418
Whoa.

1049
01:01:25,462 --> 01:01:27,506
Wow.

1050
01:01:29,507 --> 01:01:33,246
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1051
01:01:33,682 --> 01:01:36,203
I mean, I've been waiting
to take the next step,

1052
01:01:36,204 --> 01:01:39,117
you know, into features for a long time,
so it's a really good thing.

1053
01:01:39,118 --> 01:01:44,902
<i>This isn't The View. I mean, we can have
an honest talk about this if we want.</i>

1054
01:01:45,685 --> 01:01:48,729
I don't wanna step out of the spotlight
and then be forgotten.

1055
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:51,425
I don't wanna disappear. I'm freaked out.

1056
01:01:51,426 --> 01:01:54,034
I wanna be honest.
I'm really freaked out right now, okay?

1057
01:01:54,035 --> 01:01:58,079
Because, seemingly, the only actresses
that actually can survive

1058
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:01,210
are the ones that show their cooter,
and, excuse me, but I refuse to do that.

1059
01:02:01,211 --> 01:02:02,602
I have a little dignity.

1060
01:02:02,603 --> 01:02:05,689
And I don't have the frame to support
plastic surgery. I would tip over.

1061
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:08,125
And I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna exploit myself.

1062
01:02:08,126 --> 01:02:12,605
Listen, you're gonna be fine.
You have a long career ahead of you.

1063
01:02:12,606 --> 01:02:16,257
You've got, like,
four years until you're 30.

1064
01:02:16,258 --> 01:02:18,999
It's gonna be fine.

1065
01:02:21,956 --> 01:02:24,565
- How are you?
- I'm screwed.

1066
01:02:24,566 --> 01:02:30,088
Frankly, I don't stand a chance.
No, I'll be fine.

1067
01:02:30,089 --> 01:02:34,655
I've been quietly stealing money
from you for a long time.

1068
01:02:35,003 --> 01:02:39,570
You're always good at cheering me up,
Pete, thank you.

1069
01:02:41,875 --> 01:02:43,492
<i>Die</i>

1070
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,766
<i>Die</i>

1071
01:02:46,267 --> 01:02:48,015
<i>Die</i>

1072
01:02:50,442 --> 01:02:52,695
<i>I can't</i>

1073
01:02:55,879 --> 01:02:59,182
It's really good, Peter.
I just don't understand it. I don't.

1074
01:02:59,183 --> 01:03:02,531
I mean, just chalk it up to that. Please
don't play it again, 'cause I don't...

1075
01:03:02,532 --> 01:03:05,706
Just listen to it one more time and see...

1076
01:03:06,794 --> 01:03:08,838
Where's Aldous?

1077
01:03:09,925 --> 01:03:12,447
- Mr Snow, may I ask you a question?
- Okay.

1078
01:03:12,448 --> 01:03:15,578
I want to please my wife here,
on our honeymoon,

1079
01:03:15,579 --> 01:03:16,840
but I don't know what I'm doing.

1080
01:03:16,841 --> 01:03:18,492
You having difficulty sex-wise?

1081
01:03:18,493 --> 01:03:20,798
- Do you not know how to use this?
- I know how.

1082
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:23,581
- Have you had sex before?
- We can't.

1083
01:03:23,582 --> 01:03:25,146
- Why?
- Our religion.

1084
01:03:25,147 --> 01:03:26,712
Right, 'cause of God and everything?

1085
01:03:26,713 --> 01:03:27,973
Hey, that's not gonna be a problem,

1086
01:03:27,974 --> 01:03:30,278
because God should be present
in the bedroom.

1087
01:03:30,279 --> 01:03:32,887
Just tell me specifically what I need to do.

1088
01:03:32,888 --> 01:03:35,801
You need to penetrate deeply
and stimulate the clitoris simultaneously.

1089
01:03:35,802 --> 01:03:37,671
That's what you gotta do.
That's what it's about.

1090
01:03:37,672 --> 01:03:40,193
If you can involve the anus in that,
then that's absolute perfection.

1091
01:03:40,194 --> 01:03:41,237
Got it.

1092
01:03:41,238 --> 01:03:43,629
Explore her ears.

1093
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:47,065
Find it in you to be a little more circly.

1094
01:03:47,066 --> 01:03:48,196
You are a man.

1095
01:03:48,197 --> 01:03:49,544
God's within you.

1096
01:03:49,545 --> 01:03:51,023
I actually feel okay about it.

1097
01:03:51,024 --> 01:03:53,936
You know, I'm a little scared,
but I'll be all right. I'll get another job.

1098
01:03:53,937 --> 01:03:56,633
<i>That's interesting, man.
You know what else is interesting?</i>

1099
01:03:56,634 --> 01:03:59,590
<i>- What?
- Me on the moon.</i>

1100
01:03:59,591 --> 01:04:01,852
I just wanna talk to you about something.
Can you stop?

1101
01:04:01,853 --> 01:04:04,070
<i>- All right, I'm just gonna talk, and then...
- Air!</i>

1102
01:04:04,071 --> 01:04:06,549
There was this interesting moment
with Sarah.

1103
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:09,985
<i>Whoa, what? I don't wanna hear about
your interesting moment with Sarah, Pete.</i>

1104
01:04:09,986 --> 01:04:11,768
Then who am I supposed to talk to
about this?

1105
01:04:11,769 --> 01:04:15,508
<i>Well, not me, because have I ever had
an interesting moment with an ex-girlfriend?</i>

1106
01:04:15,509 --> 01:04:18,117
<i>- Do you have an ex-girlfriend? No!
- No.</i>

1107
01:04:18,118 --> 01:04:20,380
<i>No.</i>

1108
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:23,771
I would really love to get
the woman's perspective on the matter.

1109
01:04:23,772 --> 01:04:25,337
<i>- Really?
- No.</i>

1110
01:04:25,338 --> 01:04:27,120
But come on in and just sit down.

1111
01:04:27,121 --> 01:04:29,816
<i>- Stay. You have to...
- Honey, no, no, the camera's right there.</i>

1112
01:04:29,817 --> 01:04:31,077
<i>No, I know,
but I just wanna tell him, though.</i>

1113
01:04:31,078 --> 01:04:33,861
<i>- No, the camera...
- Think about how much she's hurt you.</i>

1114
01:04:33,862 --> 01:04:35,035
<i>- Hey, Liz?
- Yeah?</i>

1115
01:04:35,036 --> 01:04:37,427
I think you need to move just a tiny bit
further away from the microphone.

1116
01:04:37,428 --> 01:04:38,558
<i>- Just...
- No, closer.</i>

1117
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:39,732
<i>- Now a little further.
- Okay.</i>

1118
01:04:39,733 --> 01:04:40,863
<i>- Closer.
- And then...</i>

1119
01:04:40,864 --> 01:04:43,125
<i>- And then a little further, and then closer.
- I don't know.</i>

1120
01:04:43,777 --> 01:04:45,038
<i>- Keep your head down, though.
- I'm bad at this thing.</i>

1121
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:46,691
<i>- Can you hear me?
- Yeah, closer. Further away.</i>

1122
01:04:46,692 --> 01:04:49,604
<i>I know what you're doing.
That's not funny at all.</i>

1123
01:04:49,605 --> 01:04:51,649
<i>- You stop that.
- What?</i>

1124
01:04:52,432 --> 01:04:55,215
<i>- What's he doing?
- Come on. Yeah, yeah, real funny.</i>

1125
01:04:55,868 --> 01:04:57,041
Hey, that's a great necklace, Liz.

1126
01:04:57,042 --> 01:04:59,128
<i>- Did you have that a second ago?
- Thank you!</i>

1127
01:04:59,129 --> 01:05:01,086
<i>That's gross!</i>

1128
01:05:01,087 --> 01:05:02,564
<i>- I don't get it.
- Stop it.</i>

1129
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:06,304
<i>- He's saying if I were to sperm on you...
- What?</i>

1130
01:05:06,305 --> 01:05:09,436
<i>- ... it would be a pearl necklace.
- Why?</i>

1131
01:05:09,437 --> 01:05:12,306
<i>- Real funny.
- Sorry.</i>

1132
01:05:13,177 --> 01:05:14,872
Hey, Dracula!

1133
01:05:14,873 --> 01:05:19,091
"And when I see Van Helsing,
I swear to the Lord, I'll slay him. "

1134
01:05:21,223 --> 01:05:23,700
That shit is funny, dude!

1135
01:05:23,701 --> 01:05:25,266
Hey, Pete.

1136
01:05:25,267 --> 01:05:27,875
So I was gonna go over
to Lazy Joe's later tonight,

1137
01:05:27,876 --> 01:05:30,138
and I wanted to see
if you wanted to come and join.

1138
01:05:31,747 --> 01:05:34,442
I think I'm confused,
because I thought last night...

1139
01:05:34,443 --> 01:05:38,444
Oh, my God. Dude, get out of your head.
It's really nice out here.

1140
01:05:38,445 --> 01:05:41,140
Yeah, I bet it is.

1141
01:05:41,141 --> 01:05:42,401
All right, yeah. You know what?

1142
01:05:42,402 --> 01:05:43,836
I could totally use a
friendly hangout, so...

1143
01:05:43,837 --> 01:05:45,010
All right.

1144
01:05:45,011 --> 01:05:46,576
I don't know if you want,
instead of Lazy Joe's,

1145
01:05:46,577 --> 01:05:48,534
I was thinking of going
to Laie Point right now.

1146
01:05:48,535 --> 01:05:49,882
- Really?
- Yeah.

1147
01:05:49,883 --> 01:05:53,275
I heard that place was a pain in the ass.

1148
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,579
Okay.

1149
01:05:55,841 --> 01:05:57,188
- Hey!
- Yo, what's up, guys?

1150
01:05:57,189 --> 01:05:58,318
We're just going for a hike.

1151
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:01,145
No, you're not, you're going snorkelling.

1152
01:06:01,146 --> 01:06:02,624
I think we're gonna go on a hike.

1153
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,843
It is sea turtle fucking season, dude.
Let's go.

1154
01:06:05,844 --> 01:06:09,279
They fuck for three hours, dude.
I mean, that's magical.

1155
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,148
- No, we're going on a hike.
- I think we'll go on a hike, yeah.

1156
01:06:11,149 --> 01:06:13,932
What? Your loss.

1157
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:17,151
Why won't anybody
go snorkelling with me?

1158
01:06:22,326 --> 01:06:25,501
How you doing back there?

1159
01:06:25,545 --> 01:06:27,023
Awesome.

1160
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:30,371
I don't think I've ever been
this covered in sweat before.

1161
01:06:30,372 --> 01:06:32,546
It's like I have some sort of fever.

1162
01:06:32,547 --> 01:06:36,807
I told you this was a pain in the ass.
Could've been at Lazy Joe's.

1163
01:06:36,808 --> 01:06:38,504
- Oh, yeah.
- Uh-huh.

1164
01:06:38,505 --> 01:06:40,374
Oh, shit.

1165
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:43,027
- You good?
- No.

1166
01:06:45,159 --> 01:06:47,854
Wow, we're really going
up to the edge of this, huh?

1167
01:06:47,855 --> 01:06:50,117
Look!

1168
01:06:53,292 --> 01:06:56,292
Wow, this is really beautiful.

1169
01:06:58,815 --> 01:07:03,510
All right, so now that your show's done,
are you gonna finish the Dracula musical?

1170
01:07:03,511 --> 01:07:06,599
It's not that easy, you know.

1171
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:09,469
Sarah always thought it was crazy, and...

1172
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:14,339
Well, you're definitely crazy.
But so is everyone, right? So who cares?

1173
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:17,775
- I just don't feel like doing anything.
- Why?

1174
01:07:17,776 --> 01:07:19,167
'Cause my heart is broken,

1175
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:21,950
and I can't imagine
doing anything right now.

1176
01:07:21,951 --> 01:07:26,909
It's probably the same reason
you don't go back to school, you know?

1177
01:07:29,475 --> 01:07:32,301
Maybe it's good we got hurt like that,
you know?

1178
01:07:32,302 --> 01:07:37,694
I don't know about you,
but it makes me feel impervious to pain.

1179
01:07:37,695 --> 01:07:41,347
Yeah. Kind of like
there's nothing left to be afraid of.

1180
01:07:41,348 --> 01:07:44,087
- Yeah. No, exactly.
- Right.

1181
01:07:44,088 --> 01:07:49,263
We could leap off this rock,
and it won't hurt us as bad as they did.

1182
01:07:50,437 --> 01:07:52,393
So jump, then.

1183
01:07:52,394 --> 01:07:54,829
No, I meant that,
like, as a metaphor, you know?

1184
01:07:54,830 --> 01:07:57,918
No. Just do it.

1185
01:07:59,831 --> 01:08:03,615
You'll be fine. Jump.

1186
01:08:08,486 --> 01:08:11,356
What the hell?

1187
01:08:12,444 --> 01:08:16,445
Oh, God! Oh, God. I made her kill herself!

1188
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,750
You must be crazy!

1189
01:08:22,751 --> 01:08:25,663
- So are you gonna jump or what?
- No!

1190
01:08:25,664 --> 01:08:29,229
Come on, Peter!
I can see your vagina from here!

1191
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:32,056
I can see your hoo-ha.

1192
01:08:32,057 --> 01:08:34,448
I mean, I'll jump!

1193
01:08:34,449 --> 01:08:37,537
Chicken! Come on!

1194
01:08:52,890 --> 01:08:57,326
Please, God, don't let me die today.

1195
01:08:58,021 --> 01:08:59,891
- I'm okay!
- Okay!

1196
01:08:59,892 --> 01:09:02,892
- I'll just let go, right?
- No, no, no!

1197
01:09:02,893 --> 01:09:08,068
If you fall straight down,
you'd probably hit a rock and kill yourself!

1198
01:09:08,328 --> 01:09:10,285
- Totally.
- Yeah.

1199
01:09:10,286 --> 01:09:11,546
So what do I do?

1200
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:14,373
Why don't you press your feet
up against the rock,

1201
01:09:14,374 --> 01:09:16,461
and, like, shoot yourself off!

1202
01:09:16,462 --> 01:09:18,244
- What, like a frog?
- I don't know, Peter!

1203
01:09:18,245 --> 01:09:20,940
Just get off the fucking rock!

1204
01:09:20,941 --> 01:09:23,332
- Here I go!
- Okay!

1205
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:25,594
One!

1206
01:09:26,464 --> 01:09:27,646
Two!

1207
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:29,808
Two!

1208
01:09:32,205 --> 01:09:34,509
- Two and a half!
- Jump!

1209
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:36,345
Three!

1210
01:09:49,427 --> 01:09:53,165
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1211
01:09:53,166 --> 01:09:55,036
- You saw that, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I saw it!

1212
01:09:55,037 --> 01:09:57,558
I was there. I witnessed it.

1213
01:09:57,559 --> 01:09:59,908
Thanks.

1214
01:10:05,561 --> 01:10:08,040
Come on.

1215
01:10:14,738 --> 01:10:18,782
You've got Christ between your thighs,

1216
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,609
but with a shorter beard.

1217
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:24,652
<i>- Mahalo.
- Aloha.</i>

1218
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:27,175
- Sex!
- I'm cramping, I'm cramping.

1219
01:10:27,176 --> 01:10:29,829
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

1220
01:10:31,004 --> 01:10:34,396
Petey? Petey?

1221
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:40,092
Sorry. I knocked a bunch.

1222
01:10:40,093 --> 01:10:42,354
You were really out.
Ken sent me.

1223
01:10:43,094 --> 01:10:46,355
Dakota Fanning and her people,
they need this room.

1224
01:10:46,356 --> 01:10:48,963
She loves it here.

1225
01:10:48,964 --> 01:10:50,834
Oh.

1226
01:10:50,835 --> 01:10:52,095
So does that mean I have to leave the hotel?

1227
01:10:52,096 --> 01:10:54,140
Ken found you a room.

1228
01:10:55,097 --> 01:10:58,793
I'll take it, yeah.
I wanna hang out with Rachel a little more.

1229
01:11:00,011 --> 01:11:04,317
Are those sad tissues or happy tissues?

1230
01:11:07,101 --> 01:11:10,493
Maybe you should just give me a minute.

1231
01:11:13,015 --> 01:11:16,059
It was the only room available!

1232
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:18,843
I'm sure it was!

1233
01:11:21,583 --> 01:11:24,104
- Hey, how's it going?
- It's all right.

1234
01:11:24,105 --> 01:11:25,669
Really?

1235
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:29,193
I think you got some pain behind
those eyes. A kind of pain that only...

1236
01:11:29,194 --> 01:11:30,844
Okay, you know what?
Let's cut the bullshit.

1237
01:11:30,845 --> 01:11:33,150
I wanna stand up on a wave before I leave.

1238
01:11:33,151 --> 01:11:35,019
I don't think you're ready yet, man.

1239
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:39,588
- I'm ready to ride giants, Koonu.
- I think you're ready.

1240
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:03,463
Petey!

1241
01:12:07,551 --> 01:12:08,724
- Hi.
- Hi.

1242
01:12:08,725 --> 01:12:11,552
Miss Marshall, what can I do for you?

1243
01:12:11,553 --> 01:12:14,117
Is there a place
to get good sushi around here?

1244
01:12:14,118 --> 01:12:18,641
Yeah. Yeah, there's a really great place
about five minutes from here called Asuki.

1245
01:12:18,642 --> 01:12:20,206
Perfect.

1246
01:12:20,207 --> 01:12:21,859
- Do you want me to get you a map?
- Please.

1247
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:23,729
Okay.

1248
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:27,165
So, this is where we are.

1249
01:12:27,166 --> 01:12:31,340
Head down Kamehameha,
and then pass Funaho Loko Marsh.

1250
01:12:31,341 --> 01:12:33,340
And it should be right to the left.

1251
01:12:33,341 --> 01:12:35,602
It might take, like, five minutes.

1252
01:12:35,603 --> 01:12:38,995
- Great. Thank you.
- Any time.

1253
01:12:41,779 --> 01:12:43,212
Um...

1254
01:12:43,213 --> 01:12:46,866
- I saw you with Peter Bretter...
- Yeah.

1255
01:12:46,867 --> 01:12:49,605
...who's my ex-boyfriend.

1256
01:12:49,606 --> 01:12:52,911
Oh, my God. I'm really sorry.

1257
01:12:52,912 --> 01:12:54,389
- No.
- It's not like that at all.

1258
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:55,955
- It's not what you're...
- No, it's fine.

1259
01:12:55,956 --> 01:12:58,043
I'm just really glad
you're keeping him company, 'cause...

1260
01:12:58,044 --> 01:13:00,870
- Gosh, no.
- ... you seem like a really nice person,

1261
01:13:00,871 --> 01:13:03,653
- and you're very pretty.
- Thank you.

1262
01:13:03,654 --> 01:13:06,175
Gosh, you're, like, way prettier.

1263
01:13:06,176 --> 01:13:09,482
No, you're, like, so pretty.

1264
01:13:10,569 --> 01:13:12,830
Really?

1265
01:13:12,831 --> 01:13:16,396
- Yeah.
- Wow, thank you. Thank you.

1266
01:13:16,397 --> 01:13:18,570
And one more thing about Peter.

1267
01:13:18,571 --> 01:13:24,920
He's a really good guy. Really good.
Like, great, actually.

1268
01:13:24,921 --> 01:13:26,834
Yeah.

1269
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:28,878
Um...

1270
01:13:31,705 --> 01:13:34,314
Please don't cry, Miss Marshall.

1271
01:13:34,315 --> 01:13:37,141
God. Do you need me to get you a tissue?

1272
01:13:37,142 --> 01:13:40,881
Oh, no, I'm good, I'm good.
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1273
01:13:40,882 --> 01:13:43,143
Okay.

1274
01:13:44,144 --> 01:13:48,971
- Thank you, Rachel.
- Any time, Miss Marshall.

1275
01:13:57,886 --> 01:14:00,060
Hey, ahoy, there!

1276
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:01,843
You surf, too?

1277
01:14:01,844 --> 01:14:04,756
Good Lord, no.
I'm just drifting around, you know?

1278
01:14:04,757 --> 01:14:09,236
Getting in touch with the ocean and stuff.
It's really pleasant.

1279
01:14:09,237 --> 01:14:11,803
It was, yeah.

1280
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:13,715
I'm gonna head in.

1281
01:14:13,716 --> 01:14:16,151
Before you go, actually, Peter,
I just wanted to tell you,

1282
01:14:16,152 --> 01:14:18,543
I was listening to Sarah's iPod
the other day,

1283
01:14:18,544 --> 01:14:22,500
and amidst the interminable dross
that's on that thing,

1284
01:14:22,501 --> 01:14:24,675
I found one track that I quite liked.

1285
01:14:24,676 --> 01:14:27,807
So I checked what it was,
and it was actually one of yours.

1286
01:14:27,808 --> 01:14:33,807
And it kind of reminded me of a dark,
gothic Neil Diamond. It's great.

1287
01:14:33,983 --> 01:14:36,243
That's, like, exactly what I'm going for.

1288
01:14:36,244 --> 01:14:38,811
Right, yeah.

1289
01:14:41,594 --> 01:14:43,942
Fuck.

1290
01:14:44,812 --> 01:14:47,378
Fuck, you're cool.

1291
01:14:47,944 --> 01:14:53,728
It's so hard to say,
because, like, I hate you in so many ways,

1292
01:14:54,728 --> 01:14:56,814
but whatever.
I can see why Sarah likes you.

1293
01:14:56,815 --> 01:15:00,338
No accounting for taste, I suppose.
In her case, anyway.

1294
01:15:00,339 --> 01:15:03,469
She was with me for five years,
so there you go.

1295
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:07,383
Yeah, you got four on me there, mate.

1296
01:15:09,428 --> 01:15:11,731
You slept with Sarah a year ago?

1297
01:15:11,732 --> 01:15:16,081
I thought you knew!
Peter, please, don't take it seriously.

1298
01:15:16,082 --> 01:15:19,212
- What the fuck, man! You've...
- Don't get offended by that.

1299
01:15:19,213 --> 01:15:21,605
You can't be so casual about this!

1300
01:15:21,606 --> 01:15:24,335
This isn't Europe, okay?
There are rules here.

1301
01:15:24,336 --> 01:15:28,389
I'm really sorry.
I apologise for offending you, Peter.

1302
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:31,650
I just hope this doesn't
ruin our friendship.

1303
01:15:31,651 --> 01:15:33,085
Well, what's that about?

1304
01:15:33,086 --> 01:15:35,234
What do you think it's about?
This is a big deal!

1305
01:15:35,238 --> 01:15:37,478
What about a code of the ocean?
That's not on.

1306
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:38,609
What about codes among men?

1307
01:15:38,610 --> 01:15:39,870
You don't sleep
with another man's girlfriend!

1308
01:15:39,871 --> 01:15:41,131
- Think of...
- Get out of here!

1309
01:15:41,132 --> 01:15:45,263
- All right, okay! All right!
- Get out of here!

1310
01:16:08,662 --> 01:16:10,574
Oh, God!

1311
01:16:30,972 --> 01:16:35,408
Koonu! This guy needs help! Koonu!

1312
01:16:37,539 --> 01:16:40,669
- Should I call the front desk?
- It hurts. It hurts.

1313
01:16:40,670 --> 01:16:43,061
Wow, you got coral right there in your leg!

1314
01:16:43,062 --> 01:16:44,626
Can you get it out of my leg, please,
hotel man?

1315
01:16:44,627 --> 01:16:45,758
Can you do something about that?

1316
01:16:45,759 --> 01:16:50,019
I'd love to, you know, but hotel policy...
They don't let me do that kind of thing.

1317
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:52,020
They get all weirded out. Insurance...

1318
01:16:52,021 --> 01:16:54,020
Koonu, can you call
the front desk for me, please?

1319
01:16:54,021 --> 01:16:55,673
- Yeah.
- It really hurts.

1320
01:16:55,674 --> 01:16:58,674
Koonu, call the front desk now!

1321
01:16:58,675 --> 01:17:00,761
Okay, monster man.

1322
01:17:00,762 --> 01:17:02,675
Pete, he's not gonna do nothing.

1323
01:17:02,676 --> 01:17:04,632
I kind of have this thing about blood, okay?

1324
01:17:04,633 --> 01:17:08,503
Look at it. It's raping my leg.
Peter, get it out of my fucking leg, please!

1325
01:17:08,504 --> 01:17:10,808
One, two.

1326
01:17:10,809 --> 01:17:12,982
- You can't get it out.
- It's really in there.

1327
01:17:12,983 --> 01:17:15,504
- Get it out of me!
- Three!

1328
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:17,766
Fuck my arse!

1329
01:17:17,767 --> 01:17:20,681
Okay, I got it.
It's all done. It's all over.

1330
01:17:20,682 --> 01:17:23,160
Everything looks fine.

1331
01:17:25,378 --> 01:17:28,291
<i>It's all good! They're coming wiki wiki.</i>

1332
01:17:28,292 --> 01:17:32,683
Can you get some towels for me, please?
I'm really losing a lot of blood.

1333
01:17:32,684 --> 01:17:34,771
You sound like you're from London.

1334
01:17:34,772 --> 01:17:37,859
Yeah, I'm from London.

1335
01:17:42,296 --> 01:17:44,165
What's going on?

1336
01:17:44,166 --> 01:17:48,340
You fainted.
I didn't want you to wake up by yourself.

1337
01:17:48,341 --> 01:17:51,863
- How's your friend? Is he all right?
- Yeah.

1338
01:17:51,864 --> 01:17:54,385
They gave him stitches,
and he's sleeping it off.

1339
01:17:54,386 --> 01:17:56,560
- Hey, you wanna hear something funny?
- What?

1340
01:17:56,561 --> 01:17:58,865
Are you ready to laugh?
'Cause this is a gas.

1341
01:17:58,866 --> 01:18:00,213
Okay.

1342
01:18:00,214 --> 01:18:03,779
Edward Scissorhands over there told me
that you two were fucking each other

1343
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:06,476
for a whole God damn year
while we were together.

1344
01:18:06,477 --> 01:18:07,606
Shit.

1345
01:18:07,607 --> 01:18:09,389
How about that, Sarah?

1346
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:12,043
I'm sorry, Peter.

1347
01:18:12,304 --> 01:18:15,217
Pete, you shouldn't be up
and walking around. Can you please...

1348
01:18:15,218 --> 01:18:17,957
Please don't touch me.
Just don't touch me, okay?

1349
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:19,696
I'm not touching you.

1350
01:18:19,697 --> 01:18:23,002
Will you just please sit? Please?

1351
01:18:23,046 --> 01:18:25,873
All right, I'll sit down,
but I'm sitting down 'cause I want to,

1352
01:18:25,874 --> 01:18:30,134
not because you've asked me to sit, okay?

1353
01:18:30,135 --> 01:18:32,396
Great.

1354
01:18:37,355 --> 01:18:39,441
A year?

1355
01:18:39,442 --> 01:18:42,137
Listen, I get it, okay? I just...

1356
01:18:42,138 --> 01:18:45,138
I need to understand what I did
to make you cheat. I just...

1357
01:18:45,139 --> 01:18:51,705
Pete, it's not anything you did.

1358
01:18:51,706 --> 01:18:55,575
You didn't do anything.
I mean, you were great.

1359
01:18:55,576 --> 01:18:58,402
Will you please cut the bullshit
and have a talk with me?

1360
01:18:58,403 --> 01:19:01,030
Fine. Cutting the bullshit.

1361
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:05,492
It got really hard to keep taking care of you
when you stopped taking care of yourself.

1362
01:19:05,493 --> 01:19:06,752
I tried to get you out of the house.

1363
01:19:06,753 --> 01:19:11,624
I tried to get you off your little island
you loved so much, the couch.

1364
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:13,407
You didn't wanna see the light of day!

1365
01:19:13,408 --> 01:19:18,583
God, there was one week
when you wore sweatpants! Every day.

1366
01:19:22,584 --> 01:19:27,150
You shall not pass!

1367
01:19:27,368 --> 01:19:30,629
You know what? If they were Sean John
sweatpants, it would have been fine.

1368
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:33,848
But because they're Costco brand,
it's like the worst thing I could do.

1369
01:19:33,849 --> 01:19:37,414
That has nothing to do with it.
That's what you don't get.

1370
01:19:37,415 --> 01:19:41,240
I'm sorry that I didn't end up being
who we thought I was gonna be, you know?

1371
01:19:41,241 --> 01:19:46,155
I tried really hard. I promise you that.
I just didn't have it in me.

1372
01:19:46,156 --> 01:19:48,677
I think if you had just, maybe tried harder.

1373
01:19:48,678 --> 01:19:51,069
I tried!

1374
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:53,679
You have no idea how hard I tried, Peter.

1375
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:55,332
I talked to a therapist.

1376
01:19:55,333 --> 01:19:57,724
I talked to my mother.
I read every book possible.

1377
01:19:57,725 --> 01:19:59,942
I took love seminars. I took sex seminars.

1378
01:19:59,943 --> 01:20:02,508
None of it worked.
None of it made a difference to you.

1379
01:20:02,509 --> 01:20:05,986
And I couldn't drown with you any more.

1380
01:20:05,987 --> 01:20:10,770
Don't you dare sit there
and tell me that I didn't try.

1381
01:20:10,771 --> 01:20:12,858
I did.

1382
01:20:12,859 --> 01:20:16,251
You were just too stupid to notice.

1383
01:20:48,216 --> 01:20:51,433
Whoa. I thought you were gonna wear
the shirt I got you.

1384
01:20:51,434 --> 01:20:53,216
What? No.

1385
01:20:53,217 --> 01:20:56,000
I mean, I do love that shirt you got me.

1386
01:20:56,001 --> 01:20:58,740
I admire Sir Tommy Bahama an awful lot.

1387
01:20:58,741 --> 01:21:03,568
He's a talented man, but tonight,
I feel that this is appropriate.

1388
01:21:07,787 --> 01:21:12,223
Wow, thank you. Yeah, Sarah got it for me.

1389
01:21:12,614 --> 01:21:16,833
This is, like, way more convenient
than my backpack.

1390
01:21:18,281 --> 01:21:19,498
Awesome hat!

1391
01:21:19,599 --> 01:21:22,486
Thank you.
Yeah, my girlfriend got it for me!

1392
01:21:22,487 --> 01:21:25,183
- I'm fucking with you!
- Cool!

1393
01:21:29,488 --> 01:21:33,185
Sarah, can I use this lipstick, please?

1394
01:21:37,187 --> 01:21:41,144
Sure. I don't care.

1395
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,405
I think it looks great.
But if you're not, let's go change.

1396
01:21:44,406 --> 01:21:47,928
No, I like it. I didn't like it at first.
Now I really think it's...

1397
01:21:47,929 --> 01:21:49,711
Oh, bloody hell. This is a small resort.

1398
01:21:49,712 --> 01:21:52,191
Hi, Peter.

1399
01:21:53,495 --> 01:21:56,017
Hey. Wow.

1400
01:21:56,409 --> 01:21:58,670
Aldous, Sarah, this is Rachel.

1401
01:21:58,671 --> 01:22:01,279
Sarah bought me this shirt.

1402
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,671
I could've guessed that. Yeah.

1403
01:22:02,672 --> 01:22:03,889
- Looks great.
- You look great.

1404
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:05,889
Looks awesome.

1405
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:08,064
- See.
- Thanks.

1406
01:22:08,065 --> 01:22:12,326
Mr Snow, I'm so sorry.
I did not know you guys were coming.

1407
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:13,500
You're gonna have to wait five minutes.

1408
01:22:13,501 --> 01:22:14,631
I did not know you guys were coming.

1409
01:22:14,632 --> 01:22:16,414
It's okay. It's not a problem.

1410
01:22:16,415 --> 01:22:18,284
I didn't see you guys, so...

1411
01:22:18,285 --> 01:22:21,501
There's really no need to weep.

1412
01:22:21,502 --> 01:22:24,069
I'm not crying.

1413
01:22:24,547 --> 01:22:27,461
It's no problem, honestly.
It's not a problem.

1414
01:22:27,462 --> 01:22:30,592
- So, your table is ready, guys.
- Oh, great.

1415
01:22:30,593 --> 01:22:32,244
Hey, have a lovely evening, you two.

1416
01:22:32,245 --> 01:22:34,158
- Thank you. Have a great dinner, you guys.
- Thank you.

1417
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:35,593
You're welcome to join us, obviously,
if you want.

1418
01:22:35,594 --> 01:22:37,462
- Okay.
- Wouldn't dream of it. What?

1419
01:22:37,463 --> 01:22:39,639
What?

1420
01:22:39,682 --> 01:22:41,551
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

1421
01:22:41,552 --> 01:22:43,334
- That's great. Awesome.
- Sure.

1422
01:22:43,335 --> 01:22:44,682
Great. I'll just set two more places.

1423
01:22:44,683 --> 01:22:45,813
- Okay.
- Not a big deal.

1424
01:22:45,814 --> 01:22:47,292
Awesome.

1425
01:22:47,293 --> 01:22:52,075
So this is actually happening.
We're gonna let this happen.

1426
01:22:52,076 --> 01:22:53,119
I am so sorry.

1427
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,164
I never thought in a million years
she would say yes.

1428
01:22:56,121 --> 01:22:57,294
I did.

1429
01:22:57,295 --> 01:23:00,295
What? I just accepted an invitation.
I didn't wanna be rude.

1430
01:23:00,296 --> 01:23:02,078
It's got us in a terrible situation.

1431
01:23:02,079 --> 01:23:04,165
Now I'm gonna have to sit with him
wearing this shirt all night.

1432
01:23:04,166 --> 01:23:06,036
You're wearing the shirt regardless.

1433
01:23:06,037 --> 01:23:07,819
Australia is amazing.

1434
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:11,385
- I'm telling you. It is a great place to shoot.
- Yeah?

1435
01:23:11,386 --> 01:23:14,691
Rachel, you would love it.
You would love it.

1436
01:23:14,692 --> 01:23:17,518
I wanna go. I really, really wanna go there.

1437
01:23:17,519 --> 01:23:20,518
- Wait, so when's the movie coming out?
- Mmm.

1438
01:23:20,736 --> 01:23:22,736
It came out.

1439
01:23:22,737 --> 01:23:25,607
- It was already released.
- Oh.

1440
01:23:27,303 --> 01:23:29,303
Well, you know, it's an island.

1441
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:30,434
It's isolated.

1442
01:23:30,435 --> 01:23:31,912
- Yeah.
- Movies don't really come out here.

1443
01:23:31,913 --> 01:23:34,609
- Obviously.
- Did you like it?

1444
01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:37,176
- The movie?
- Yeah.

1445
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:39,523
- It was...
- Awful bloody film.

1446
01:23:39,524 --> 01:23:41,698
I say, it's just a ridiculous premise.

1447
01:23:41,699 --> 01:23:45,452
What would happen
if your mobile phone killed you?

1448
01:23:45,453 --> 01:23:48,053
Why would a mobile phone kill anyone?
It doesn't make sense.

1449
01:23:48,054 --> 01:23:50,854
How could a mobile phone
have an agenda and kill people.

1450
01:23:50,858 --> 01:23:52,353
I told her that when she read the script.

1451
01:23:52,354 --> 01:23:54,005
Yeah. You were the voice of reason, mate.

1452
01:23:54,006 --> 01:23:55,789
I tried to be, but she didn't listen.

1453
01:23:55,790 --> 01:23:58,615
Going around killing people.
A mobile phone, like, doing murders.

1454
01:23:58,616 --> 01:24:00,573
Why couldn't you just take the battery
out of the phone?

1455
01:24:00,574 --> 01:24:02,051
Right. That's it. The battle's over.

1456
01:24:02,052 --> 01:24:04,443
- Yeah, we've won.
- I hated it.

1457
01:24:04,444 --> 01:24:06,531
Well, it's not for everyone, but it...

1458
01:24:06,532 --> 01:24:08,618
No, it's ridiculous.
Here's my favourite scene.

1459
01:24:08,619 --> 01:24:11,098
Ring-ring. Hello?

1460
01:24:11,099 --> 01:24:13,011
- Right. It would never happen.
- Yeah.

1461
01:24:13,012 --> 01:24:14,446
No, it could never happen.

1462
01:24:14,447 --> 01:24:18,621
It's a metaphor for addiction to technology.

1463
01:24:18,622 --> 01:24:22,796
For society,
for how we're reliant on technology.

1464
01:24:22,797 --> 01:24:23,927
I get it. I'm with you.

1465
01:24:23,928 --> 01:24:25,623
It's a metaphor for a crap movie.

1466
01:24:25,624 --> 01:24:27,798
Well, it was the right choice
for me at the time.

1467
01:24:27,799 --> 01:24:30,452
- Sure.
- You know?

1468
01:24:41,977 --> 01:24:44,238
Well, this is awkward.

1469
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:49,282
Yeah?

1470
01:24:49,283 --> 01:24:51,761
- It's a bit more awkward now.
- A little.

1471
01:24:51,762 --> 01:24:54,806
Hey, excuse me.
Can we get another bottle of wine, please?

1472
01:24:54,807 --> 01:24:56,066
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1473
01:24:56,067 --> 01:24:57,196
Mr Snow?

1474
01:24:57,197 --> 01:24:59,588
Can I get cranberry juice
with a bit of lime in it, please.

1475
01:24:59,589 --> 01:25:01,285
Do you want cranberry juice
or cranberry cocktail?

1476
01:25:01,286 --> 01:25:03,895
Because I can probably rustle up either one.
Throw some OJ...

1477
01:25:03,896 --> 01:25:05,939
I don't care.

1478
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:08,418
Okay, great.

1479
01:25:16,812 --> 01:25:20,204
Hey, can we get another bottle of wine?

1480
01:25:28,685 --> 01:25:30,771
If I've learned anything from addiction,
it's that,

1481
01:25:30,772 --> 01:25:35,381
you know, life is as brief as the
twinkling of a star over all too soon.

1482
01:25:35,382 --> 01:25:37,453
So if you're in a situation
where you're with a woman,

1483
01:25:37,454 --> 01:25:40,904
why not do the most interesting thing
that you can do in that situation?

1484
01:25:40,905 --> 01:25:43,384
And by which, I don't mean
have a conversation,

1485
01:25:43,385 --> 01:25:44,949
have a chin-wag, a bit of a chat.

1486
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:48,385
Lose yourself in something
that's both ancient and perennial.

1487
01:25:48,386 --> 01:25:53,561
Find something eternal, perpetual.
Lose yourself in fuck.

1488
01:25:54,648 --> 01:25:56,953
I'm going to disagree.

1489
01:25:56,954 --> 01:25:58,388
Respectfully, of course, sir.

1490
01:25:58,389 --> 01:26:00,605
Maybe for you, that works.

1491
01:26:00,606 --> 01:26:03,824
For me, it's much more enjoyable
to get to know somebody.

1492
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:05,520
If you end up sleeping with them,
that's great.

1493
01:26:05,521 --> 01:26:07,695
But I like getting to know somebody.

1494
01:26:07,696 --> 01:26:09,260
But he...

1495
01:26:09,261 --> 01:26:13,305
What he's saying is that
he's gonna stick it wherever he wants,

1496
01:26:13,306 --> 01:26:15,915
but he's joking.

1497
01:26:15,916 --> 01:26:17,698
I ain't. No, I'm not joking.

1498
01:26:17,699 --> 01:26:21,091
It's just what I believe, really.

1499
01:26:21,439 --> 01:26:23,003
So...

1500
01:26:23,004 --> 01:26:28,744
Just so we're clear and so I can hone in
on your central thesis of the night,

1501
01:26:28,745 --> 01:26:30,309
wade through all the bullshit,

1502
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:33,136
you're telling me
that you think you have the right

1503
01:26:33,137 --> 01:26:35,833
to just fuck anyone, anywhere, anytime?

1504
01:26:35,834 --> 01:26:37,834
- Yes. There it is. That's right.
- That's what you're saying?

1505
01:26:37,835 --> 01:26:40,965
Not so eloquently
as you just put it, sweetheart.

1506
01:26:40,966 --> 01:26:42,400
But ultimately, yes, that is...

1507
01:26:42,401 --> 01:26:44,487
Oh, no! Not the shirt!

1508
01:26:44,488 --> 01:26:48,053
Take my eyes, but not the shirt. Mmm.

1509
01:26:48,054 --> 01:26:51,054
Yeah, that's pretty much
what I believe, Sarah.

1510
01:26:51,055 --> 01:26:53,663
When you're done making jokes,
are you gonna get a napkin?

1511
01:26:53,664 --> 01:26:56,187
Do you know what? I think I've improved it,
actually, against all odds.

1512
01:26:56,188 --> 01:26:57,535
I think I deserve a design award.

1513
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:59,622
Please get some seltzer water.

1514
01:26:59,623 --> 01:27:03,015
- Garחon, could we get some...
- I saw it from farther away.

1515
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:05,972
- Okay.
- Just lean back for a second.

1516
01:27:05,973 --> 01:27:07,755
No, it's all right.
It's not there. Let me...

1517
01:27:07,756 --> 01:27:09,189
You're very diligent. I appreciate it.

1518
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:11,190
Let go of the glass now.
You're gonna have to walk away.

1519
01:27:11,191 --> 01:27:13,191
Bless you. There you are.

1520
01:27:13,192 --> 01:27:15,887
Oh, me, oh, my.

1521
01:27:15,888 --> 01:27:19,063
- Call the doctor.
- Oh, good.

1522
01:27:27,152 --> 01:27:29,325
- I love Hawaii.
- Is it good?

1523
01:27:29,326 --> 01:27:33,500
Yeah, it's nice,
but I think for like a week tops.

1524
01:27:33,501 --> 01:27:35,371
Any more than that, I know I'd go crazy,

1525
01:27:35,372 --> 01:27:39,242
because I think that
Hawaii is a place to escape

1526
01:27:39,243 --> 01:27:43,156
for people who can't deal
with the real world.

1527
01:27:44,461 --> 01:27:49,549
Yeah, you know, there's so few
personal shoppers and pet therapists.

1528
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:52,768
Gosh, it's such a hard life.

1529
01:28:02,075 --> 01:28:04,728
I like living here.

1530
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:10,164
- Anyone need any more vino?
- I think we're good.

1531
01:28:11,251 --> 01:28:13,121
I've a question for you real quick, Mr S.

1532
01:28:13,122 --> 01:28:16,469
I was actually meaning to ask you,
what did you exactly think of my demo?

1533
01:28:16,470 --> 01:28:18,948
Did you get it? Did you get it?

1534
01:28:18,949 --> 01:28:21,775
Oh, no. I was gonna listen to that,

1535
01:28:21,776 --> 01:28:25,908
but then I just carried on living my life.

1536
01:28:27,821 --> 01:28:29,168
Not at all?

1537
01:28:29,169 --> 01:28:33,169
No, I didn't, because, you know,
I go on my instincts,

1538
01:28:33,170 --> 01:28:35,823
and they weren't good.

1539
01:28:36,476 --> 01:28:40,433
You know what, dude?
Fuck you, okay? You can go fuck yourself.

1540
01:28:40,434 --> 01:28:42,433
I can't yell right now
because I'll get fired.

1541
01:28:42,434 --> 01:28:43,564
My boss will hear me,

1542
01:28:43,565 --> 01:28:45,564
and then I won't be able
to pay off my student loans.

1543
01:28:45,565 --> 01:28:48,478
But you know what? You're an asshole.
I fucking hate you.

1544
01:28:48,479 --> 01:28:49,609
I bought all your records.

1545
01:28:49,610 --> 01:28:52,435
This whole fucking time, I've been trying
to get you to come hang out with me.

1546
01:28:52,436 --> 01:28:56,828
I'm gonna have people fuck with your food
the rest of your trip, you fucking dick!

1547
01:28:56,829 --> 01:29:00,221
I like him. That was quite moving.

1548
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:16,007
Wait, wait, wait.

1549
01:29:16,008 --> 01:29:18,791
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1550
01:29:18,835 --> 01:29:21,096
Are you sure that you're not,
like, too drunk?

1551
01:29:21,097 --> 01:29:24,837
Jesus, would you stop being so sensitive.

1552
01:29:50,104 --> 01:29:52,148
Aldous.

1553
01:29:52,714 --> 01:29:54,148
Wake up.

1554
01:29:54,149 --> 01:29:56,888
- Aldous. Wake up.
- Hmm...

1555
01:29:56,889 --> 01:29:59,454
Make love to me.

1556
01:30:00,846 --> 01:30:03,717
All right. You go on top, though,
'cause I'm knackered.

1557
01:30:18,982 --> 01:30:21,113
Listen.

1558
01:30:22,548 --> 01:30:25,288
Yes! Yes!

1559
01:30:27,115 --> 01:30:29,201
- Yeah.
- Yes!

1560
01:30:29,202 --> 01:30:31,768
- Oh, yes!
- Yeah!

1561
01:30:33,812 --> 01:30:36,857
- Yeah! Oh, God!
- Yeah!

1562
01:30:40,032 --> 01:30:41,596
- Right there!
- Yes!

1563
01:30:41,597 --> 01:30:44,118
- Yes!
- Yes! She's having an orgasm!

1564
01:30:44,119 --> 01:30:46,075
This is the best sex ever!

1565
01:30:46,076 --> 01:30:48,598
Yeah, all right, that'll do.

1566
01:30:48,599 --> 01:30:50,860
What?

1567
01:30:50,991 --> 01:30:53,861
I made a mistake coming here with you.

1568
01:30:56,644 --> 01:30:59,732
And I'm not done either!

1569
01:30:59,863 --> 01:31:01,950
- Please shut up! Okay.
- Okay!

1570
01:31:01,951 --> 01:31:04,254
You're still involved with him next door,
ain't you?

1571
01:31:04,255 --> 01:31:05,386
Excuse me?

1572
01:31:05,387 --> 01:31:07,255
You should've seen yourself
at dinner, Sarah.

1573
01:31:07,256 --> 01:31:11,735
Then we come back here,
and you put on that ghastly performance.

1574
01:31:11,736 --> 01:31:14,779
I mean, I've heard that
women do fake orgasms,

1575
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:16,345
but I've never seen one.

1576
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:18,528
It really deeply upset me.

1577
01:31:18,529 --> 01:31:21,077
You should have seen yourself at dinner.

1578
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:25,522
"Oh, I'm Aldous Snow.
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

1579
01:31:25,523 --> 01:31:27,609
"No, no drinks for me, thanks.

1580
01:31:27,610 --> 01:31:29,261
"Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. "

1581
01:31:29,262 --> 01:31:31,957
That's a really reductive impression.

1582
01:31:31,958 --> 01:31:34,480
If I wanted to see you act badly,
I'd just watch your TV show,

1583
01:31:34,481 --> 01:31:36,785
which, obviously, I can't now,
because it's been cancelled.

1584
01:31:36,786 --> 01:31:38,873
Oh, my God, you're such a prick.

1585
01:31:38,874 --> 01:31:40,003
And you know what?

1586
01:31:40,004 --> 01:31:43,134
Let me tell you something
about these tattoos, okay?

1587
01:31:43,135 --> 01:31:47,397
That is Buddhist. That is Nordic.
That is Hindu. That's just gibberish.

1588
01:31:47,398 --> 01:31:49,615
They are completely conflicting ideologies.

1589
01:31:49,616 --> 01:31:52,007
And that does not make you
a citizen of the world.

1590
01:31:52,008 --> 01:31:54,877
It makes you full of shit.

1591
01:31:57,401 --> 01:32:01,010
Was that genuine or did you fake that?

1592
01:32:02,011 --> 01:32:06,271
Right. I'm gonna probably clear off now.

1593
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:07,837
I'll have a little sleep for a few hours,

1594
01:32:07,838 --> 01:32:12,709
then I'm gonna probably go
in the morning, okay?

1595
01:32:16,493 --> 01:32:18,710
I hate your music.

1596
01:32:18,711 --> 01:32:23,016
Yeah, well,
I fucked the housekeeper the other day.

1597
01:32:28,365 --> 01:32:30,887
Are you sleeping?

1598
01:32:30,888 --> 01:32:33,366
Not any more.

1599
01:32:37,890 --> 01:32:43,065
I know that I'm leaving in a couple of days,
so I don't even know

1600
01:32:44,022 --> 01:32:47,023
what the hell this means,

1601
01:32:49,545 --> 01:32:53,459
but I really like spending time
with you a lot.

1602
01:32:55,895 --> 01:32:58,591
I know. Me too.

1603
01:33:06,463 --> 01:33:08,377
Hey.

1604
01:33:13,639 --> 01:33:16,118
Good morning.

1605
01:33:17,901 --> 01:33:19,378
Where are you going?

1606
01:33:19,379 --> 01:33:22,814
The Korean Textile Manufacturer's Luau.

1607
01:33:22,815 --> 01:33:25,206
- Just kill me.
- Fun.

1608
01:33:25,207 --> 01:33:27,251
Joy.

1609
01:33:28,121 --> 01:33:32,774
I want you to know
that I meant what I said last night.

1610
01:33:33,122 --> 01:33:35,601
I know you did.

1611
01:33:35,863 --> 01:33:38,428
I did, too.

1612
01:33:39,906 --> 01:33:43,647
- Can I see you again tonight?
- Yeah.

1613
01:33:43,777 --> 01:33:46,472
- I get off at 7:00.
- Yay.

1614
01:33:46,473 --> 01:33:48,649
Bye.

1615
01:33:50,649 --> 01:33:51,996
Sir, morning mai tai.

1616
01:33:51,997 --> 01:33:53,997
You know what?

1617
01:33:53,998 --> 01:33:58,955
I actually will not be having
an alcoholic beverage this morning.

1618
01:34:25,485 --> 01:34:28,485
- Jump! Jump! Jump!
- Don't make me do it.

1619
01:34:47,056 --> 01:34:49,881
Hey. Morning, mate.

1620
01:34:49,882 --> 01:34:53,622
- How are you today?
- Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. You okay?

1621
01:34:53,623 --> 01:34:55,840
Am I okay? I'm better than okay, my friend.

1622
01:34:55,841 --> 01:34:57,492
You seem sprightly.

1623
01:34:57,493 --> 01:34:59,363
I...

1624
01:34:59,364 --> 01:35:01,058
I had a great time last night.

1625
01:35:01,059 --> 01:35:04,494
- Congratulations. Well done. Well done.
- Thank you.

1626
01:35:04,495 --> 01:35:06,365
What about you? What's with the bag?

1627
01:35:06,366 --> 01:35:09,801
Right, yeah. I'm off back to England, mate.

1628
01:35:09,802 --> 01:35:11,279
Oh, you and Sarah are going to England.

1629
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:14,497
No, no, no. I'm just going alone.

1630
01:35:14,498 --> 01:35:16,454
- Yeah.
- Did you guys have a fight or something?

1631
01:35:16,455 --> 01:35:20,108
Yeah, it was really... How you served
five years under her, I don't know.

1632
01:35:20,109 --> 01:35:24,804
You deserve a medal or a holiday
or at least a cuddle from somebody.

1633
01:35:24,805 --> 01:35:26,587
You were only here for a week.

1634
01:35:26,588 --> 01:35:28,761
Well, I don't know.
For me, that one week of it

1635
01:35:28,762 --> 01:35:33,459
was like going on holiday with,
I don't know, I wouldn't say Hitler,

1636
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:36,895
but certainly Goebbels.
It was like a little holiday with Hitler.

1637
01:35:36,896 --> 01:35:38,373
Jesus.

1638
01:35:38,374 --> 01:35:41,895
Hey, listen, at least it's clear now
for you two to reconnect.

1639
01:35:41,896 --> 01:35:44,158
Oh...

1640
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:46,723
No, no. No.

1641
01:35:46,724 --> 01:35:49,115
You know what?
I have a good thing going on with Rachel,

1642
01:35:49,116 --> 01:35:50,898
and I want to see that through.

1643
01:35:50,899 --> 01:35:54,421
Well, maybe you could have both of them.
Rachel and Sarah.

1644
01:35:54,422 --> 01:35:57,335
They got on all right, didn't they,
at dinner? So maybe...

1645
01:35:57,336 --> 01:35:59,857
You know what?
First of all, I'm not that kind of guy.

1646
01:35:59,858 --> 01:36:04,641
And even if I was, I don't think that I have
the sexual competency to really pull that off.

1647
01:36:04,642 --> 01:36:06,294
Yeah. It's a gift.

1648
01:36:06,295 --> 01:36:09,556
I will say,
if you do get back with Miss Marshall,

1649
01:36:09,557 --> 01:36:12,861
handle with care, because, you know...

1650
01:36:14,036 --> 01:36:15,818
Okay. Well, I think my ride's here.

1651
01:36:15,819 --> 01:36:18,601
So I'm gonna skedaddle then
before anything else happens to me.

1652
01:36:18,602 --> 01:36:20,298
Before life gets any more daft.

1653
01:36:20,299 --> 01:36:21,951
Is someone gonna take that?

1654
01:36:21,952 --> 01:36:25,560
Listen, don't let them grind you down.

1655
01:36:25,822 --> 01:36:27,169
Take it easy.

1656
01:36:27,170 --> 01:36:30,779
Hey, look at my driver.
I'm gonna have sex with her.

1657
01:36:34,346 --> 01:36:37,955
He said it was clear I wasn't over you.

1658
01:36:39,565 --> 01:36:41,434
And then he left.

1659
01:36:41,435 --> 01:36:43,913
Fucking prick.

1660
01:36:44,914 --> 01:36:48,219
And then I started thinking,
what if he's right?

1661
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:52,133
What if I'm not over you?

1662
01:36:53,047 --> 01:36:56,961
- Sarah...
- Please just let me finish, Pete.

1663
01:37:02,919 --> 01:37:07,181
What if I made
a really, really horrible mistake?

1664
01:37:09,095 --> 01:37:13,356
- Sarah.
- Yeah?

1665
01:37:13,357 --> 01:37:15,878
Stop pulling my face towards your face.

1666
01:37:15,879 --> 01:37:17,749
Why?

1667
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:19,401
You don't like it?

1668
01:37:19,402 --> 01:37:24,098
Listen, pulling my shirt towards you
is the same concept as pulling my face.

1669
01:37:24,099 --> 01:37:28,360
Let's spend one more night here together,
and then let's go home and then...

1670
01:37:28,361 --> 01:37:30,360
And we'll just pretend
like it never happened.

1671
01:37:30,361 --> 01:37:32,536
- ... face reality. No.
- That's the big plan?

1672
01:37:32,537 --> 01:37:34,319
No. I love you.

1673
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:38,451
That's not fair.
That's not fair of you to say that to me.

1674
01:37:39,451 --> 01:37:41,887
Please, Peter.

1675
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:47,322
- Tell me you're sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

1676
01:37:49,672 --> 01:37:52,193
I missed you.

1677
01:37:56,543 --> 01:37:58,587
I'm sorry.

1678
01:38:00,587 --> 01:38:03,588
God, I missed you, Peter.

1679
01:38:09,894 --> 01:38:11,546
All right.

1680
01:38:11,547 --> 01:38:14,982
Get hard for me, Pete. Get hard for me.

1681
01:38:14,983 --> 01:38:17,808
- I know what I'm supposed to do.
- Okay.

1682
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:19,766
Just do it. Come on. Get hard.

1683
01:38:19,767 --> 01:38:21,549
- I'm trying.
- Okay.

1684
01:38:21,550 --> 01:38:24,419
- Here. Just let me do it for a second.
- Okay.

1685
01:38:25,637 --> 01:38:28,855
I really want you, Peter. I missed you.

1686
01:38:28,856 --> 01:38:30,334
You don't want help?

1687
01:38:30,335 --> 01:38:33,769
- You don't want help? Uh-huh.
- Can you be quiet just for a minute?

1688
01:38:33,770 --> 01:38:34,900
Do you want my hands?

1689
01:38:34,901 --> 01:38:39,120
Maybe just don't talk for a second
is what I mean.

1690
01:38:39,294 --> 01:38:40,858
Do you want my mouth?

1691
01:38:40,859 --> 01:38:44,338
- Yeah, maybe your mouth.
- Yeah. Okay.

1692
01:38:51,905 --> 01:38:54,514
What's the problem, Peter?

1693
01:38:54,515 --> 01:38:56,688
- I don't know...
- More?

1694
01:38:56,689 --> 01:38:59,995
You can keep trying if you want.

1695
01:39:03,474 --> 01:39:05,561
What's wrong with you?

1696
01:39:05,562 --> 01:39:07,735
- Nothing is wrong with me, okay?
- Okay.

1697
01:39:07,736 --> 01:39:09,822
- No, I didn't...
- Just, something doesn't feel right any more.

1698
01:39:09,823 --> 01:39:11,823
Okay. Well, did you... You know what?

1699
01:39:11,824 --> 01:39:13,998
Did you drink today?
Because sometimes when you drink...

1700
01:39:13,999 --> 01:39:15,564
Excuse me.

1701
01:39:15,565 --> 01:39:19,391
No, I haven't had anything to drink today.

1702
01:39:20,783 --> 01:39:25,479
Maybe the problem is that
you broke my heart into a million pieces,

1703
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:29,219
and so my cock doesn't want
to be around you any more, okay?

1704
01:39:29,220 --> 01:39:31,264
Ever!

1705
01:39:32,351 --> 01:39:34,960
Because you know what I just realised?
Huh?

1706
01:39:34,961 --> 01:39:38,788
You're the God damn devil. Okay?

1707
01:39:42,485 --> 01:39:46,399
Wedding in Hawaii! Real original!

1708
01:39:56,358 --> 01:39:59,533
- Hey.
- Hey, Rachel.

1709
01:40:00,012 --> 01:40:03,098
- Sarah and Aldous broke up this morning.
- What a surprise.

1710
01:40:03,099 --> 01:40:06,839
So I went to check on Sarah, and...

1711
01:40:08,666 --> 01:40:11,144
Listen, I'm here
because I don't want to lie to you, okay?

1712
01:40:11,145 --> 01:40:13,145
Some stuff happened.

1713
01:40:13,146 --> 01:40:15,101
I'm really, really sorry that it did,

1714
01:40:15,102 --> 01:40:18,146
but I'm also really glad
that it did, because

1715
01:40:18,147 --> 01:40:23,713
I'm able to see so clearly now that
Sarah and I are not right for each other.

1716
01:40:23,974 --> 01:40:26,453
What stuff?

1717
01:40:27,627 --> 01:40:33,367
I went up to make sure that she was okay,
and it got weird.

1718
01:40:33,368 --> 01:40:35,237
But now everything is fine.

1719
01:40:35,238 --> 01:40:36,890
And I need you to understand

1720
01:40:36,891 --> 01:40:39,195
that I meant everything that I said
to you this morning.

1721
01:40:39,196 --> 01:40:40,456
What exactly happened, Peter?

1722
01:40:40,457 --> 01:40:42,109
We fooled around a little bit.

1723
01:40:42,110 --> 01:40:46,328
Shut the fuck up,
and tell me exactly what you did.

1724
01:40:47,024 --> 01:40:53,023
All right. I went to her room,
and she was crying and crying and crying.

1725
01:40:53,070 --> 01:40:55,243
And I felt like I should comfort her.

1726
01:40:55,244 --> 01:40:58,678
And then she started kissing me
because I was comforting her.

1727
01:40:58,679 --> 01:41:00,896
And then the next thing I knew,
I was kissing her

1728
01:41:00,897 --> 01:41:03,071
because she had been kissing me
because of the comforting.

1729
01:41:03,072 --> 01:41:07,943
Then she started taking my clothes off,
and then her clothes were off.

1730
01:41:10,074 --> 01:41:13,900
Then she performed
10 to 15 seconds of oral sex on me.

1731
01:41:13,901 --> 01:41:15,466
Okay. Peter, you can leave now.

1732
01:41:15,467 --> 01:41:18,205
- At the most. Maximum.
- Thank you for staying at Turtle Bay.

1733
01:41:18,206 --> 01:41:19,423
Rachel, please don't do this.

1734
01:41:19,424 --> 01:41:21,946
The only reason I'm telling you this
is because I really care about...

1735
01:41:21,947 --> 01:41:24,033
Listen to me, Peter.

1736
01:41:24,034 --> 01:41:27,164
I was a mess, too. I understand. Okay?

1737
01:41:27,165 --> 01:41:30,514
But it does not excuse
you acting like a complete asshole.

1738
01:41:30,515 --> 01:41:33,297
Listen, I know that
I fucked things up for a minute,

1739
01:41:33,298 --> 01:41:34,993
but I'm not like every other asshole.

1740
01:41:34,994 --> 01:41:38,646
You should not be with anybody right now.

1741
01:41:38,647 --> 01:41:40,865
Anybody.

1742
01:41:41,778 --> 01:41:43,734
I know...

1743
01:41:43,735 --> 01:41:45,387
I know that there is something here.

1744
01:41:45,388 --> 01:41:47,388
I know that I was not wrong about that.

1745
01:41:47,389 --> 01:41:52,260
And, yes, it's only been four days,
but I know you feel it, too.

1746
01:41:55,956 --> 01:41:58,695
I need you to leave.

1747
01:41:59,783 --> 01:42:04,654
Do not write me. Do not call me.
Do not e-mail me.

1748
01:42:09,481 --> 01:42:12,569
Peter, I need you to go.

1749
01:42:16,048 --> 01:42:19,049
I won't bother you any more.

1750
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:21,441
I'm sorry.

1751
01:42:27,966 --> 01:42:30,835
I don't know what to do.

1752
01:42:37,837 --> 01:42:39,924
Hey, brother, what you doing, huh?
You stealing my art?

1753
01:42:39,925 --> 01:42:42,446
I want you to put it back right now.
Put it back, bro!

1754
01:42:42,447 --> 01:42:45,056
Listen, give me the picture.

1755
01:42:45,057 --> 01:42:47,448
Doo-doo paper.
You're throwing doo-doo paper?

1756
01:42:47,449 --> 01:42:50,101
Give me the picture.

1757
01:42:51,928 --> 01:42:55,275
Don't be stupid, brother.
Just give me the picture.

1758
01:42:55,276 --> 01:42:58,190
You can hit me as many times as you want.
I'm not giving you the photo back.

1759
01:42:58,191 --> 01:43:00,235
Oh, yeah.

1760
01:43:06,019 --> 01:43:10,542
No, no, no.
Peter, I told you I did not want to see you.

1761
01:43:28,939 --> 01:43:32,808

what there is to think about.

01:45:52,413 --> 01:45:53,673
Because, D, he...

She licked the tip. That doesn't count.

1786
01:45:56,284 --> 01:45:59,109
- Of course it counts. He...
- He what?

1787
01:45:59,110 --> 01:46:02,762
He refused a blowjob
from his ex-girlfriend mid-blowjob.

Do you know what that's like for a man?
It's called blue balls, Rachel.

This guy is like Gandhi, but better.

1790

He likes puppets.

1791

Peter, this is great.

1829

- It was really funny. Yeah.
- Thank you.

1830
01:49:02,813 --> 01:49:04,507
You know what?
I didn't realise that it was a comedy,

1831
01:49:04,508 --> 01:49:10,075
and then someone told me that, and
it just, like, opened the whole thing up.

1832
01:49:11,163 --> 01:49:14,598
- How long are you in town for?
- Open-ended.

- Bold.
- Yeah.

1834
01:49:15,773 --> 01:49:17,817
Yeah, you know, I'm kind of
checking out some schools.

- Congratulations.
- Yeah, maybe.

1836
01:49:25,645 --> 01:49:28,341
You never called.

1837
01:49:28,602 --> 01:49:32,908
You told me not to. And I listened.

1838
01:49:33,082 --> 01:49:35,343
- Right.
- Wasn't easy.

1839
01:49:35,344 --> 01:49:37,865
I might have called once and hung up.

1840
01:49:37,866 --> 01:49:41,213
- No. No.
- From a private number.

1841
01:49:41,214 --> 01:49:43,084
No.

1842
01:49:43,085 --> 01:49:44,214
Maybe.

1843
01:49:44,215 --> 01:49:46,606
Peter!
Nice job, Bretter.

1844
01:49:46,607 --> 01:49:47,868
Well, you should probably go back.

1845
01:49:47,869 --> 01:49:50,086
Would you like to hang out
while you're here?

1846
01:49:50,087 --> 01:49:52,564
- Maybe we could go to dinner or...
- Yeah.

1847
01:49:52,565 --> 01:49:54,956
- Still have my number?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you.

1848
01:49:54,957 --> 01:49:57,697
- Go.
- Yeah, I should do that.

1849
01:49:57,698 --> 01:50:00,567
Yeah, yeah. Go mingle.

1850
01:50:03,742 --> 01:50:04,959
Hey, Peter!
Hey, Bretter!

1851
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:06,742
Come over here and meet my mom!

1852
01:50:06,743 --> 01:50:09,439
- Go, go.
- Off I go.

1853
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:11,222
- Hey, Peter.
- Nice job, Bretter.

1854
01:50:11,223 --> 01:50:13,223
The play was sick, man. Good work.

1855
01:50:13,224 --> 01:50:15,527
- Nice job.
- Good job, man. That was awesome.

1856
01:50:15,528 --> 01:50:16,658
So cool!

1857
01:50:16,659 --> 01:50:18,746
Peter, congratulations.

1858
01:50:18,747 --> 01:50:22,268
I just wanted to say thank you.
I had such a great time tonight.

1859
01:50:22,269 --> 01:50:24,791
Oh, good. You know what?
I'm gonna change out of this unitard,

1860
01:50:24,792 --> 01:50:26,661
- 'cause I'm getting a chafe. Okay.
- Enough said.

1861
01:50:26,662 --> 01:50:29,750
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1862
01:50:54,714 --> 01:50:56,844
Hey, Peter?

1863
01:50:59,192 --> 01:51:03,628
I was just calling you.

1864
01:51:07,978 --> 01:51:10,977
- Wow.
- Oh, Peter.

1865
01:51:10,978 --> 01:51:14,892
- I'm sorry.
- Stop laughing.

1866
01:51:15,066 --> 01:51:18,240
Can you please stop laughing?

1867
01:51:19,416 --> 01:51:21,894
I missed you.

1868
01:51:21,938 --> 01:51:23,067
I just...

1869
01:51:23,068 --> 01:51:28,678
You know, I actually wanted to tell you
that I've been thinking so much about...

1870
01:52:18,257 --> 01:52:22,301

1876
01:52:42,003 --> 01:52:45,220
