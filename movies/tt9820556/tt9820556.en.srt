[baby crying]

I am Admiral Kiernan Adams.

61
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:44,101
Welcome to my home,
the <i>U.S.S. Hercules.</i>

62
00:04:44,235 --> 00:04:48,372
The <i>Herc</i> is the last
quant-engine-enabled ship

63
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:51,175
capable of making

As to the 41 other shuttles

that have gone ahead
to New Earth,

66
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,450
well, I hope it's the paradise
they said it would be.

67
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,118
For the next six months,

68

we will blaze
across space and time.

69
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:05,755
For most of us in Cryo,

70
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,958
this journey
will be but a dream.

71
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:12,730
For our children, it will be
the journey that gave them life.

- You okay? You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

79
00:05:31,148 --> 00:05:33,450
- We're fine. The baby's fine.
- Yeah.

Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
You gotta go.

One second.

85
00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:00,444
- Are you okay?
- [man] I got her onboard,

86
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:02,212
so where's that ship
you promised me?

87
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:04,214
You're lucky you're
standing on this one.

88
00:06:04,348 --> 00:06:06,417
- Hold on. You promised me...
- I expect you to fucking move.

89
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,252
Go on.

90
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:09,852

91
00:06:12,523 --> 00:06:13,590
You're late.

92
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:18,028
Hi, sir. I'm, uh, Noah.

93
00:06:18,162 --> 00:06:20,830
Let me guess.
You are the dead man walking

94
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,832
that knocked up
my unmarried daughter

95
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,301
and made her drop out
of West Point.

96
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:26,303
No, this is not.
This man helped us.

97
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:28,871
He helped us get on the ship,
saved my life,

98
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:30,907
saved our lives.

99
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:33,610
Is that right?

100
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:38,182
I guess I owe you.

101
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,849
No, sir.

102
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,420
Glad you're safe.

103
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:45,855

Your dad's
gonna find out eventually.

107
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:19,590
I know. I can't wait
for him to know you.

108
00:07:19,723 --> 00:07:22,025
[chuckles] I just want that
to be in an environment

109
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:23,761
where he can't
open a window and...

110
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:26,330

117

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,481
So like I said...

327
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:40,950
you see anyone acting strange...

328
00:21:41,952 --> 00:21:45,922
you'd tell me, right?

329
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:49,826
Yes, sir.

330
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,195
Good.

331
00:21:52,862 --> 00:21:54,198
Good.

- Nothing.

00:22:08,178 --> 00:22:09,380
If it's not coming off,

336
00:22:09,513 --> 00:22:10,847
you're not using
the strong stuff.

- [liquor flows]
- Like what?

338
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:15,619
Did you completely
dick off in training?

339
00:22:15,753 --> 00:22:20,591
Moxacell. You got to be careful,
or that shit'll melt your face.

All I'm saying is the
Fermi paradox makes sense.

342
00:22:27,631 --> 00:22:31,101
What if... What if they're
not hiding in space, huh?

343
00:22:31,235 --> 00:22:33,370
Could they be hiding
in another time,

344
00:22:33,504 --> 00:22:34,705
another dimension?

345
00:22:34,837 --> 00:22:38,008
Well, everyone on the ship
is now a lot dumber

346
00:22:38,142 --> 00:22:39,576
from listening
to that conversation.

347
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,546
Or could
another alien civilization

348
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,882
have been hit
with an extinction-level event?

Anyway, I'm so fucking high,

stealing jet fuel,
and he had Moxacell.

Did you bring it?

Do you want to start,
or should I?

does the commander know?

That you're
with the rebellion.

That you're trying
to blow up the ship,

trying to get revenge for all
those people you left behind.

He said all that, huh?

446
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:52,409
And if anything happens to me,

447
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:53,844
he's gonna go looking.

448

Moonshine.

Torpedo Clay's special recipe.

So now that we know
and we know that you know,

00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:55,206
we, uh, think it's best
that we keep this between us.

If Commander Stanley finds out,

we are all looking

all of us.

00:31:26,304 --> 00:31:27,504
All right!

Let's have some fun.

We can confiscate their booze.

487
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:02,974
So they paid an ad agency

488
00:32:03,107 --> 00:32:05,076
to come up with
the phrase "New Earth."

489
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:07,011
I mean, shit,
I could come up with that.

490
00:32:07,144 --> 00:32:09,446
New Earth.
We fucked up the old,

so here's a new one.

492
00:32:11,715 --> 00:32:13,383
My brother made it
on the first ship.

493
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:15,452
Who do you have
waiting for you?

494
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:17,587
Nobody.

495
00:32:17,721 --> 00:32:18,688
Just your family?

496
00:32:18,822 --> 00:32:20,091
I don't have a family.

497
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,492
I thought you told us
you had a family.

498
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:26,030
Um, back on Earth.

499
00:32:26,163 --> 00:32:28,798
Just my mom,
and she had to stay behind.

500
00:32:29,766 --> 00:32:31,601
So it's just me now.

501
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:37,008
There was a girl.

502
00:32:37,141 --> 00:32:38,942
Ah, here we go.

503
00:32:39,076 --> 00:32:40,744
Alex.

504
00:32:42,113 --> 00:32:43,413
A real lady.

505
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:45,149
[Ortega] Hmm.

506
00:32:45,283 --> 00:32:47,450
She married my brother.

Ain't that right?

512

12:30 a.m., May 4th.

656
00:43:29,326 --> 00:43:30,861
I am beginning the autopsy.

657
00:43:30,995 --> 00:43:35,566
I will start collecting samples
for DNA sequencing.

What happened?

663
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:27,718
Stanley just locked us in.

[beeping]

665
00:44:50,774 --> 00:44:54,778
More time is needed
to evaluate these results.

666
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:57,914
I will begin now
to make my first incision

667
00:44:58,049 --> 00:45:00,417
and visual assessment.

00:46:06,084 --> 00:46:08,318
I know you can hear me!

684
00:46:08,452 --> 00:46:10,253
How long
are we supposed to sit here?

685
00:46:10,387 --> 00:46:11,922
Hey, do you think
something happened?

686
00:46:12,056 --> 00:46:13,724
How the fuck would I know?

687
00:46:13,857 --> 00:46:15,093
[grunts]

688
00:46:15,225 --> 00:46:16,560
Chambers!

689
00:46:17,028 --> 00:46:19,163
Teek! Somebody!

690
00:46:19,296 --> 00:46:21,364
Open the goddamn door!

691
00:46:26,037 --> 00:46:27,437
Let's go.

692
00:46:30,807 --> 00:46:33,343
So you misplaced some organs?

693
00:46:33,477 --> 00:46:35,746
No. I was alone
with Blue all night.

694
00:46:35,879 --> 00:46:37,581
When I cut him open,
his spleen, his heart,

695
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:39,449
his nervous system, his blood

696
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:41,485
had basically
been eaten down to nothing.

697
00:46:41,618 --> 00:46:43,687
Eaten? Like "eaten"?

698
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,722
Wait. So if Blue didn't
have anything inside him...

699
00:46:45,856 --> 00:46:47,691
Then how could he still move?

700
00:46:47,824 --> 00:46:50,128
It's 'cause he was being
controlled from the inside.

701
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,262
Let me show you something.

702
00:46:56,433 --> 00:46:58,635
The strand on the left
belongs to Blue,

703
00:46:58,769 --> 00:47:01,371
just like yours and mine...
proteins, lipids,

704
00:47:01,505 --> 00:47:04,441
the building blocks
of all life in the universe.

705
00:47:04,574 --> 00:47:07,778
Strand on the right, also Blue,

706
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:10,214
except it's
not even carbon-based.

707
00:47:10,347 --> 00:47:11,915
It's not human.

708
00:47:14,185 --> 00:47:16,353
If I'm guessing...

709
00:47:16,486 --> 00:47:18,956
Blue picked up some sort
of virus or a parasite.

710
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:22,526
Invades the body of the host and
then wears it like a cheap suit.

711
00:47:22,659 --> 00:47:23,760
So how did it get onboard?

712
00:47:23,894 --> 00:47:25,395
I had the ship
do a head count

713
00:47:25,529 --> 00:47:26,797
after you found Ortega,
just to make sure

714
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:28,799
that nobody else
had gone missing,

715
00:47:28,932 --> 00:47:30,567
and I found this.

716
00:47:31,735 --> 00:47:33,670
[beeping]

717
00:47:33,804 --> 00:47:35,605
Noah's not in the system.

718
00:47:35,739 --> 00:47:38,909
He's using forged papers.

719
00:47:39,043 --> 00:47:40,510
Don't fucking move!

720
00:47:40,644 --> 00:47:41,845
Wait, wait, wait.
I can explain...

721
00:47:41,979 --> 00:47:43,513
- I can explain.
- Hey, hey! Oh, whoa, whoa.

722
00:47:43,647 --> 00:47:45,682
- What was the fucking plan?
- No! I don't know!

723
00:47:45,816 --> 00:47:47,884
Infect the crew?
Then eat our guts

724
00:47:48,019 --> 00:47:49,053
while you sink the ship?

725
00:47:49,187 --> 00:47:50,188
No! Fucking no!

726
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,255
He's not trying to kill us.

727
00:47:51,388 --> 00:47:52,489
He's just a scared kid

728
00:47:52,622 --> 00:47:54,424
trying to survive,
like the rest of us.

729
00:47:56,893 --> 00:47:58,328
Any more secrets?

730
00:48:01,698 --> 00:48:02,967

- [grunts]

731

[coughs]

732
00:48:06,736 --> 00:48:09,140
So if this asshole
didn't let it in,

733
00:48:09,273 --> 00:48:13,110
we need to find out who did
and what we're dealing with.

734
00:48:13,944 --> 00:48:15,512
Show them.

735
00:48:16,147 --> 00:48:17,881
They deserve to know.

736
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,362
Holy shit.

737
00:48:39,736 --> 00:48:41,705
[sighs] And look.

738
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:44,976
They're not alone.

739
00:48:46,077 --> 00:48:48,478
So when you said parasite,
you meant...

740
00:48:48,612 --> 00:48:51,048
Alien. And it might
still be out there.

741
00:48:51,948 --> 00:48:55,019
If it's out there,
we kill it.

742
00:48:55,152 --> 00:48:56,220
[Teek] What is it?

743
00:48:57,154 --> 00:48:59,123
- I don't know.
- Where did it come from?

744
00:48:59,257 --> 00:49:00,857
Again, I don't know.

745
00:49:00,992 --> 00:49:03,727
So how does a thing like that
sneak onboard without us knowing?

746
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:06,130
Because somebody
had to bring it onboard.

747
00:49:08,732 --> 00:49:10,834
Do we know who did it?

748
00:49:12,569 --> 00:49:14,205
What are you doing?

749
00:49:14,338 --> 00:49:16,573
We have to wake up
the admiral.

750
00:49:16,706 --> 00:49:18,608
- No, we don't.
- Something is on this ship

751
00:49:18,742 --> 00:49:21,778
killing his men.
This is his responsibility.

752
00:49:21,912 --> 00:49:23,580
Well, the paranoid bastard

753
00:49:23,713 --> 00:49:26,217
made sure we couldn't
break into his quarters,

754
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:28,052
let alone wake him from Cryo.

755
00:49:28,185 --> 00:49:29,486
And I don't trust
the stowaway,

756
00:49:29,619 --> 00:49:32,589
so he goes out the air lock.

757
00:49:33,357 --> 00:49:34,758
Stanley, let him go!

758
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,028

Someone's letting them out.

That's impossible.
Only Stanley can do that,

I already told you I don't know.

Blue, Ortega, and Xu
were all dead,

so how the fuck is it
still able to control them?

797

- I didn't bring it on the ship.
- Think! Try anything!

Look, I didn't
fight my way onto the ship

801
00:52:02,373 --> 00:52:04,275
so I could kill anyone.

I'm here so I could

- What, and send a message?

There's no signal

All right, Doc,
how do we kill it?

I don't know.
Bullets only slowed them down.

01:01:59,936 --> 01:02:01,505
I thought it would
kill us fast.

Teek...

987
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:04,608

01:02:04,741 --> 01:02:06,309
- Teek.
- [Clay] You're lying.

989
01:02:06,443 --> 01:02:08,512
- You didn't do it.
- It was me!

There should be a vent

Everything's not about "us."

1014
01:04:15,505 --> 01:04:18,341
There are 300,000 souls

Isn't that what you maniacs

What about them?

1019
01:04:25,415 --> 01:04:27,018
Maybe mankind
had its chance.

1020
01:04:27,151 --> 01:04:30,654
See, we can't keep destroying
everything that we touch.

1021
01:04:31,521 --> 01:04:33,356
There's a lot of us who get it.

1022
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:36,793
We see humanity
for the parasite that it is.

1023

Shame on you.

1024

What is it?

1026
01:04:43,533 --> 01:04:44,935
You brought it here.

01:04:45,069 --> 01:04:46,703
You don't know?

1028
01:04:47,704 --> 01:04:48,973
Where'd it come from?

Where is it from?

1031
01:04:56,047 --> 01:04:57,380
The experiments.

1032
01:04:57,514 --> 01:04:59,016
So they made it.

1033
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:01,319
No, we didn't make it.

1034
01:05:01,451 --> 01:05:02,485
We brought it back.

1035
01:05:02,619 --> 01:05:04,487
You brought it back
from where?

1036
01:05:04,621 --> 01:05:08,658
Another planet?
Another universe?

1037
01:05:09,793 --> 01:05:12,596
Maybe it was here
from before the universe.

1038
01:05:12,729 --> 01:05:15,432
And it's gonna kill us all,
even you,

No.

1041
01:05:19,303 --> 01:05:21,005
Because it wants to.

1042
01:05:21,938 --> 01:05:24,075

flush 'em out the air-vac.
How's that sound?

Works for me, sir.

Ah, look here.

Wake 'em up. Strap up. Move out.

1061

We, uh, graduated
from the same academy.

- Once upon a time...

he was a warrior.

1065
01:06:27,972 --> 01:06:31,175
He disobeyed orders
during the Eos uprising.

He refused to fire on
protestors during the riots.

He's an idiot,

1151
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:44,441
Something new.

1152
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:47,877
Moxacell.

1153
01:13:48,011 --> 01:13:49,213
Moxacell?

1154
01:13:49,346 --> 01:13:50,848
I used it on Blue,
and it worked.

1155
01:13:50,981 --> 01:13:52,483
And you're
just now telling us?

1156
01:13:52,616 --> 01:13:53,883
You sure he was dead?

1157
01:13:54,017 --> 01:13:55,252
This thing
has tricked us before.

1158
01:13:55,386 --> 01:13:57,154
I watched him
melt away to nothing.

01:14:02,259 --> 01:14:03,594
Clay, what about your stash?

1162
01:14:03,727 --> 01:14:05,295
Where's the moonshine?

1163
01:14:06,597 --> 01:14:08,265

- How did they even get inside?
- [Chambers] We let it.

1194
01:15:58,675 --> 01:16:00,210
It tried for the reactor
with Blue.

1195
01:16:00,344 --> 01:16:01,912
When that failed,
it went for the admiral,

1196
01:16:02,045 --> 01:16:03,680
the only person on this ship
with access to the reactor,

1197
01:16:03,814 --> 01:16:05,516
and when we stopped it,
it came for us,

1198
01:16:05,649 --> 01:16:08,352
because it knew we would find
some way to wake him up.

1199
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,088
It's been playing us all along.

01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:24,434
- What?
- No.

1205
01:16:24,568 --> 01:16:26,069
And there's no aliens
trying to eat us?

1206
01:16:26,203 --> 01:16:28,272
- They've left us alone?
- What the fuck?

1207
01:16:28,405 --> 01:16:30,207
So we're on a ship
headed to New Earth

1208
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:32,977
at the speed of light
with an unstable reactor

1209
01:16:33,143 --> 01:16:34,478
- and an alien?
- Yeah, we got it.

1210
01:16:34,611 --> 01:16:37,180
So why kill 300,000 when you
can kill an entire planet?

1211
01:16:37,314 --> 01:16:40,617
You're talking
about 50 million people.

1212
01:16:40,751 --> 01:16:42,686
The last 50 million.

[Chambers] No, this is
