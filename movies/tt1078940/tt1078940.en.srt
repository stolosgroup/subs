3
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,887
What was that?

4
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,888
Honey, are the kids
up? What are they doing?

5
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:44,395
I peed.

6
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,033
Kevin peed the bed.

7
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,467
Our bed? Uh-huh.

8
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,203
All 500 thread counts
of Egyptian cotton.

9
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,305
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

10
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,307
I don't want you to
worry about it, buddy.

11
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:58,308
It'll happen again your freshman
year of college, trust me.

12
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,813
No more sodas before bed!

13
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,548
Sit down here. But I like soda.

14
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,151
How you doing, big guy? Good morning.

15
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:06,252
Let's have a big morning!

16
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:09,253
Let's start off with a little
breakfast, get our Froot Loops.

17
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:11,824
Here's Daddy's coffee. And I need it.

18
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:14,326
Here's your bowl of
fruit, without the loops.

19
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,428
Why no loop?

20
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,495
Daddy doesn't need loops.

21
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:17,930
I gotta eat it. If I eat a big meal now,

22
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,198
then I can watch what I eat later.

23
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,833
Otherwise, I'll get starved
and raid the refrigerator.

24
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:21,934
Okay, honey. We've got to hurry up,

25
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,035
'cause we got to go to hockey.

26
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,103
I thought you could do that

27
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:26,238
because I might try to get a
little bit of work done today.

28
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,108
Honey, we have to go by the
showroom and pick out the tile.

29
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,444
I want you to see it. We
talked about this last week

30
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:34,013
and I told you how
important today was for me.

31
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:36,615
I'm Mega Man! May the best team win!

32
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:38,918
Okay, guys, let's keep it down.

33
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,686
Keep the eyes on the... On the screen.

34
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:41,921
You guys doing good?
- Yes.

35
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,022
Honey? Yeah.

36
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:45,291
What do you think? Nickel, brushed
nickel, chrome or brushed chrome?

37
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,459
I like the silver ones.

38
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,593
They're all silver.

39
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,795
Well, great. Pick out whichever
knob that you like, then.

40
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,630
No, I'm not gonna pick
whichever knob I like

41
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,432
because you know what's gonna happen?

42
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,201
Is that I'm gonna pick one
and then you're gonna complain

43
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:56,469
once they're in and
then it'll be too late.

44
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,039
Hello? Dave, where
the heck have you been?

45
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,742
I'm picking out pulls. Why have
you been calling me nonstop?

46
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,743
Well, you know how my credit's
all screwed up because of my wife?

47
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,047
But you're divorced.

48
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,815
I need you to cosign for my motorcycle.

49
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,751
What motorcycle? I'm
buying a motorcycle.

50
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,153
Shane, you have no money.

51
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:17,154
Why in the world would you be buying
a motorcycle that you can't afford?

52
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,459
Dave, you're white. You
can't understand this.

53
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,727
This is something different.

54
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,929
Don't play the race
card with me, Froot Loop.

55
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,664
I'll take him in. You
stay with Kevin, okay?

56
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,333
Okay. All right, go ahead.

57
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,101
Have fun, champ. Go get 'em, buddy.

58
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,102
You should see this thing. It's
awesome. Even Trudy loves it.

59
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,407
Who's Trudy?

60
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,842
That's my girlfriend.

61
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:37,977
Girl from the mall?

62
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,645
She's 20 years old, Dave.

63
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,514
Let's go. Let's move
it. I got bikes to move.

64
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,516
Listen, Shane. You are not buying

65
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:46,085
some 20-year-old
broad a motorcycle.

66
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:47,920
I'm not buying her
anything, it's for me!

67
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,921
Daddy, what's taking so long?

68
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:52,691
Hey, baby, I'm on the phone,

69
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,692
and I would prefer it if you
didn't call me that in public.

70
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,596
But I call all my boyfriends Daddy!

71
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,372
Dave, you gotta do this for me.

72
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:07,640
Why don't you just lease it?

73
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,874
No, she'll know.

74
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,843
Who will know? She's a kid.

75
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,211
Buy her a Hello Kitty book.

76
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,380
Get her an assignment notebook
and put rainbow stickers in it.

77
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,714
You don't have to buy her a motorcycle.

78
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,017
Did you or did you not say, "Move on"?

79
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,518
I told you to try to work it out.

80
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,720
Joey's the one who told you to move on.

81
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,222
Can you give me a minute?

82
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:26,223
Try to make it fast, Daddy.

83
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,697
Dave, I'm hurting. I would
love for my wife to come back.

84
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,670
But we know that's not gonna happen.

85
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,406
It's nice to feel appreciated.

86
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:43,407
I need this for me.

87
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,744
Fine. Just text me the address. Okay?

88
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,249
Pick out a helmet, baby!

89
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,585
Daddy!

90
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:53,752
So, honey, this is the tile.

91
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,088
It's all gonna happen at once
and I really need you to dial in.

92
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,256
Sweetheart, I'll help you.

93
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:58,557
I want a sugar cone.

94
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,392
I'm gonna hit you
after this, buddy. Okay.

95
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,594
Honey, you work from 8:00 to 8:00.

96
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:02,828
You're not gonna be helping anyone.

97
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,096
Hang on, honey, okay?

98
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,231
It's just really busy right now

99
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,732
because the video game ships this month.

100
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,434
Now that I have you, I
just want you to dial in

101
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:09,935
and tell me what you really think.

102
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,070
It's fine.

103
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,171
Do you love it?

104
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,039
As much as I can love
tile, I love this tile.

105
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,442
Okay, good, 'cause it's $1,000.

106
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:17,943
Really? Mmm-hmm.

107
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,111
Is that installed?

108
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,412
Nope, just the tile.

109
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,615
Well, what is it made
out of? Whale tusks?

110
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,116
No, it's not made out of whale tusks.

111
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,885
This is so boring.

112
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,286
Give me just one second.
Let me just grab this.

113
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:28,387
Honey? We have to do this today. Hello?

114
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,955
Hello, Dave. Joey?

115
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,223
Yeah, hey. Look... Just
one second, that's it.

116
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,424
...what are you doing
about the Jason thing?

117
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,193
If it's Joey, can you ask him
if he's coming to the party?

118
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,061
Are you... Are you coming
to the party on Sunday?

119
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,129
Yeah, yeah, I'll be there.

120
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,264
Yeah, he's coming, all right?

121
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,465
Give me one second. Stay with Mom.

122
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:40,599
One second.

123
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,401
Jason's gonna be calling you, all right?

124
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,304
He's got another one of
his PowerPoint deals that...

125
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,773
Hold on one second. Hello?

126
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,441
Hey, Dave, it's Jason.

127
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:52,442
Listen, I'd love to put something
on the books with you and Ronnie.

128
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,880
Are you gonna make it to
Kevin's birthday on Sunday?

129
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,483
Yes, I am. Now, listen,
I was hoping that

130
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,151
you guys would come
down here to the firm

131
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,553
because Cynthia and I have
a PowerPoint presentation

132
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,056
that would just play gangbusters
in the conference room.

133
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:07,057
Okay, okay, hold on one
second. It's ringing.

134
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,627
Hello? Why'd you hang up on me?

135
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,129
I didn't hang up on you. You're on hold.

136
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,398
He's trying to get me to see
another one of his PowerPoint things.

137
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,499
That stuff creeps me out.

138
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,600
It's just how he communicates.

139
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,968
He's... He's, you know...
He's overly efficient.

140
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,469
Well, I don't like
hearing about ball cancer,

141
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,071
let alone looking at diagrams.

142
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,172
Joey, he was scared.

143
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,307
Tell him I'm not going.

144
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,474
I ain't telling him you're not going.

145
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,509
You know, I got him on the other line.

146
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,643
You can tell him yourself. Hold on.

147
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,178
I don't want to... I don't...

148
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,313
Hello, Jason?

149
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,348
Yeah. I got Joey on the line.

150
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:31,350
Hey, Joey, I've left you

151
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,519
a bunch of voice mail messages
all morning. Where are you?

152
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,987
Listen, I can't make it.

153
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,022
Well, we haven't even
set a time yet, you know.

154
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,524
If you'd listened to the voice mail,

155
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,459
you'd know that this
is just a feeler call

156
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,694
to check your temperature on schedule.

157
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:44,695
I'm not sitting through another
slide show about ball cancer.

158
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:47,533
Listen, pal, I'm alive today because
of early detection, all right?

159
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:48,634
Is this about ball cancer?

160
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,969
"Cause I..
- I'm not into that, either.

161
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,203
I'm gonna wrap this up right now.

162
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,874
and if you two refuse to check
your scrotums for hardened nodules,

163
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,209
I certainly can't force you, can l?

164
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,712
Look, I gotta go, all right? Bye+

165
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,713
Dave, are you still there? Hello, Dave?

166
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,051
Kevin! Kevin, that's not a real toilet!

167
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,053
Sweetheart, he's pissing in
the middle of the whole thing!

168
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,188
Buddy, I gotta go.

169
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,857
But Cynthia and I are willing to
offer you a life-changing opportunity.

170
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,826
Jason, you don't understand.
My son is literally peeing

171
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,694
right in the middle of the
store. I gotta go. Go, go, go.

172
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,062
Okay, but that's not
a real toilet there.

173
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,964
It looks like a real toilet to me.

174
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,965
Yeah, it looks real. Okay.

175
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,502
That's a whole other conversation.

176
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,870
You feel better? Yep.

177
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,839
Okay, let's button those up.
You want me to get those for you?

178
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,840
Yep.

179
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,680
There's not a lot to
say. Sorry about that.

180
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,594
Mom, Dad's home.

181
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:49,728
Hi, hon.

182
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,097
Hey, how was your day?

183
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,932
Usual. Yours?

184
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,934
Good.

185
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,003
Okay, love you. Bye.

186
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,938
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait
a second, wait a second.

187
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,940
You're going out? Yeah, I'm going out.

188
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,776
What are... What are you wearing?

189
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:04,943
Shorts. Shorts?

190
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,745
That's... That's a Maxi Pad.

191
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,746
Dad, they're designer shorts.
They're French. Goodbye.

192
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,617
Could you just come over
here? Sit down for a second.

193
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,085
I don't have time for this.

194
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,953
Come here. Sit down. No, I'm...

195
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,121
I'm late and they're waiting for me.

196
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,222
I know,

197
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,059
but you still live in my house
for another few months, okay?

198
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,693
Yeah, I know. Now when
you dress like that,

199
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,529
you send signals.

200
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,797
You know what kind of
guy you attract like that?

201
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:25,964
You attract the guy with the...

202
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,566
With his pants around
his ass at the mall.

203
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,234
No, I don't! Yes, you do.

204
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,470
Sweetheart, he is right.

205
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,472
Lacey, I'm saying you're beautiful.

206
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,374
You're smart. You're a good person.

207
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,276
You just got accepted into Stanford.

208
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:38,444
We're so proud of you.

209
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,946
I'm just saying know your value, okay?

210
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,782
And if a guy doesn't see
that, he doesn't deserve you.

211
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,783
No, and you don't want to
be with those guys, honey.

212
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,589
Okay, then I'll go change.

213
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,590
Thank you.

214
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,962
And could you change the
pictures on your Facebook page?

215
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:57,996
Dad.

216
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,131
It's just 'cause we love you.

217
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,466
Love me less.

218
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:02,568
I don't want any bikini
pictures on the Internet!

219
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,736
When you're living in my
house, you're a Taliban!

220
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,271
Okay? You keep your body a secret.

221
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,272
Except you get to, you know,
go to school and read books.

222
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,280
Did you send the tuition check?

223
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,682
You said you were going to.

224
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,084
Please. Don't start this again.

225
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,086
Yeah, I didn't start with
it. You just brought it up.

226
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,454
You're supposed to send the check.

227
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,522
You said you were gonna do it.

228
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,357
You never do anything
you say you're gonna do.

229
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,358
Eighteen years. Just try to hold it
together for another couple months.

230
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,461
Trust me, I'm counting the days.

231
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:36,533
Do that hurt, Daddy,
or do that feel good?

232
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:40,337
It's both. It hurt and it feel good.

233
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,208
Bang, bang.

234
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,380
Did you put in the wide beauty shots?

235
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,515
Yeah.

236
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:50,616
Are you sure?

237
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:51,850
Why would you ask me that?

238
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,152
You know I triple-check everything.

239
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,153
Yeah, no, I know. It's just,
you know, super-important, okay?

240
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,823
We only get one shot at it.

241
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,726
It'd just be nice if you could
show me a little bit of trust.

242
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,727
I do. Come on, I do, I do. I just
want this to be perfect, that's all.

243
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,565
It's not about trust. Come on.

244
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:09,566
I want it to be perfect, too.

245
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:12,569
Good.

246
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:28,820
How old is she?

247
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,423
I think she's 20. He
met her at the mall.

248
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,559
She was working at Foot Locker.

249
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,561
He was so in love with Jennifer.

250
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,496
I am shocked he met someone so quickly.

251
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:40,497
I know. I was hoping they
were just taking a break.

252
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,402
I haven't even heard from
her since they split up.

253
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:46,403
I think he got us in the
divorce. You want more wine?

254
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,509
Cynthia, it's time. We're
all set up in the bedroom.

255
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,610
Great. Ladies?

256
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:52,878
You're kidding, right? No, it's easy.

257
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,746
We brought our own screen.

258
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:55,914
You can't do it right now.

259
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,616
We're in the middle of
my son's birthday party.

260
00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:00,617
It won't take long and I know
you"re gonna be really excited.

261
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,854
Bring your booze.

262
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,290
Okay, then.

263
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,392
We're taking the wine.

264
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,393
Watch this, guys. Watch.
This is a really spooky ball.

265
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,968
Just, could you please put
the ball cancer video on?

266
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,135
I'm trying, Joey.

267
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,471
Please. I don't want to
watch that ball cancer video.

268
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,539
Where's Trudy?

269
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,541
Oh, she's watching the magician.

270
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,309
Well, there it is. Okay.

271
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,310
This is not a video and it
is not about ball cancer.

272
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,147
Thank God. That,s a first.

273
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:32,148
Jason and I are seriously
considering getting a divorce.

274
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:40,557
Okay? So, it's no secret

275
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:44,096
that Cynthia and I have had our problems

276
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,798
trying to conceive
over the last 12 months.

277
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,166
That's no reason to get a divorce.

278
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,268
No.

279
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,669
We know. Of course not.

280
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,670
But suffice it to say, it's been
more than taxing on both of us,

281
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:59,843
and it's forced us to question
our entire relationship.

282
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,347
You two are perfect for each other.

283
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,316
We're just not so sure
about that anymore.

284
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,151
We're not in a good place.

285
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,152
Now, this is not a decision
that we're taking lightly.

286
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,325
Cynthia and I have been
together for eight long years.

287
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,593
And if it's not meant to be,

288
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:17,594
we just don't want to waste
any more of each other's time.

289
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:20,864
Yeah. Because, if we do get divorced,

290
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,368
it will take at least six months

291
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,271
to go through the five stages of grief.

292
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,372
For the sake of argument,

293
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:30,373
let's optimistically assume it takes
six months to find compatible mates.

294
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,012
Tack on another 12 months for courtship,

295
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,548
an additional six months
for attempting procreation...

296
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,283
You can see how this starts to stack up.

297
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:41,284
Sounds like you guys are really
working from the heart on this one.

298
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:42,487
Well, we're lost, Dave,

299
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,856
and so what we need to do is we
need to take the next two weeks

300
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,225
and we need to find out whether
we're gonna push forward,

301
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,860
or whether we're gonna fold up shop.

302
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,861
And that is why we are going to go here.

303
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,301
You're on, Cyn.

304
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:59,302
Welcome to Eden. Okay? The
ultimate playground for couples.

305
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,407
It's got fun, it's got sun.
It's Disneyland for adults.

306
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:08,013
Wow. That is amazing.

307
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,082
Yeah, you guys are gonna have a blast.

308
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,751
Actually, we have found
a great group rate.

309
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,686
Oh, there's the fine print.

310
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,755
No, now... Now, Joey, you know, just...

311
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,223
The embarrassing fact is that, you know,

312
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,224
Cynthia and I can't afford to
go to this place by ourselves,

313
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:24,828
but if all of us go
together, it's half-price.

314
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,999
It's called the Pelican Package.

315
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Okay? It's six nights, seven
days and it's all inclusive.

316
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:34,037
And there are quite a few
activities you can choose from.

317
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,441
Who here likes to eat?

318
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,943
I know you guys do. I sure do.

319
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:39,177
Right? Boom!

320
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:42,178
Why not do it at a
four-star restaurant?

321
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,716
You guys, it has a
state-of-the-art spa.

322
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,251
Ah. Mmm-hmm.

323
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:49,054
They've got your kayaking,
they've got your windsurfing,

324
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,122
they've got your canoeing,

325
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,890
they've got your jet skiing. Wow.

326
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,726
It's got Couples Skill
Building and snorkeling...

327
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,361
Who, whoa, whoa. Back up.

328
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,529
What was that last thing?

329
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,630
Snorkeling?

330
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,032
No, no. Before snorkeling
and after jet skiing,

331
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,635
you said, "Couples Skill Building."

332
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,237
That sounds like therapy to me.

333
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,471
See, that's gonna be a problem.

334
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,973
We don't believe in therapy. No.

335
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,608
Hell to the no.

336
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,143
Then you don't have to do it.

337
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,145
That's the great thing about
the Pelican Package, you guys.

338
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,080
It really includes everything.

339
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,082
Obviously, Jason and I want to partake

340
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,717
in the Couples Skill Building,

341
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,485
but you guys can just do the fun stuff.

342
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:21,987
So what are we asking?

343
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:24,289
We're asking for you
guys to fly to paradise

344
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,792
and have an awesome time, okay?

345
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,394
I mean, this... Come
on, it would be a blast.

346
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:30,829
Jason, I got a job,

347
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,830
and with everything that's going on with
the house and with the kids right now,

348
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,301
it would be impossible
for us to leave them.

349
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,402
Yeah, we can't.

350
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,403
When was the last time you
two took a vacation? Hmm?

351
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:45,811
I mean, don't you want to go
to this island and have fun,

352
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,846
together, as a couple?

353
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,614
What kind of question is that?

354
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,849
That's like asking Richard Simmons,

355
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,418
would he rather stuff his face
or skip around to the oldies.

356
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,187
Of course he'd rather stuff
his face, but he can't,

357
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,955
'cause he's... He's got
to stay thin so he can...

358
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,491
So he can get up and do his
thing and... And make videos.

359
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:02,027
Maybe he needs the money. Maybe
he's got a gambling problem!

360
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:03,762
I don't know what goes
on in that dude's head!

361
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,864
And I'd love to go to that
island, but I can't, either.

362
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:08,865
Not 'cause I got to make videos like
Rich, but I got other obligations.

363
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,368
Listen, I can really appreciate
the situation that you guys are in.

364
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:16,105
Right, well, we need
to know by midnight.

365
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:18,477
We've been on the wait list forever

366
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,712
and these slots just opened up.

367
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,214
We'd need to leave next week.

368
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,381
Next week?

369
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,549
That's right.

370
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,451
What happened to spontaneity?
What happened to fun?

371
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,553
I don't know. Why don't we
have a PowerPoint presentation

372
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,889
on spontaneity and fun
and figure that one out?

373
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,890
Look, Cynthia and I
need this trip, okay?

374
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,160
I mean, really. You
know, the problem is,

375
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,831
you know, we've stopped having fun

376
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,832
and we're not even sure we
know how to anymore, okay?

377
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:45,804
So, what we need to find out
is can we get back to the place

378
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,372
where we really enjoy
each other, you know?

379
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,373
Can we get back to the place
of, you know, being in love?

380
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,225
Cynthia's IM-ing me.

381
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,427
Jason was IM-ing me all night.

382
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,429
What'd you tell him?

383
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,430
I logged off.

384
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:17,667
The place did look beautiful.
You know what it made me think?

385
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,037
It'd kind of be like we got
to take our honeymoon, finally.

386
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,875
God, yeah.

387
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,876
That'd be great.

388
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,115
Really?

389
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,783
Yeah.

390
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,784
Don't you think? I mean, I don't
know, maybe it's a girl thing.

391
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,288
When you're a little girl,

392
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:39,289
you dream about your
wedding and your honeymoon...

393
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,194
You know.

394
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,230
I was pretty lucky to
get that job right away.

395
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,365
Yeah, of course.

396
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,601
I mean, I can't even imagine...

397
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:52,602
Living in your dad's
basement any longer? No.

398
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,976
It's funny how time goes so fast.

399
00:17:57,977 --> 00:17:59,811
That doesn't seem that long ago.

400
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,246
No.

401
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,582
Seems like we just had so much going on

402
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,583
and we have ever since,

403
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:10,121
but maybe the thing to do is just really

404
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,057
buckle down over these next six months

405
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:15,058
and then when we come up
for air, we'll go somewhere.

406
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,596
That sounds like a plan.

407
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,109
Dave? Did you hear that?

408
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,181
Go back to bed, honey.

409
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,652
What's going on?

410
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,253
I think there's someone outside.

411
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:46,756
Okay, I'll check it out.

412
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,669
Honey, be careful.

413
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,026
Freeze! Do not move!

414
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:24,027
Hey, don't... No, it's me, it's
me, it's me! It's me! It's Jason!

415
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:25,563
What's going on?

416
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,898
It's fine, honey, it's Jason.

417
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,033
Hello!

418
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,200
Why didn't you call?

419
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,302
Didn't want to wake you up.
Sorry, blew that. Back to bed.

420
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,371
Are you crazy? I could've
blown your head off!

421
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,907
What does that say about you, huh?

422
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,908
Rapists don't gently toss
pebbles at the window, Dave.

423
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,311
Wait, can you let me figure it out,
please? There's too much going on.

424
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:43,715
Turn it off!

425
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,917
It costs money every
time this thing goes off.

426
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,020
Hello? Yeah, everything's
fine. I'm sorry.

427
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,159
The password is
"ass-tastic." That's right.

428
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,160
"Ass-tastic." One word.
"Ass-tastic." "Ass-tastic." It's...

429
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,365
A-S-S-T-A-S-T-I-C.
Okay? Ass-tastic.

430
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,603
That's right, it's... Okay.
Yeah. No, thank you. We're fine.

431
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:12,108
l... Yes, thank you.

432
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:14,946
Didn't want to go with the pet's name?

433
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,114
What are you doing here, dude?

434
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:19,050
What do you think I'm doing here?

435
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,051
Jas, you're showing up to my
house in the middle of the night.

436
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:25,056
Dave. You're breaking and
entering. You're on tilt.

437
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,291
Yeah, I know, I'm losing my mind.

438
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:29,292
This... The whole fertility doctor
thing is just an absolute disaster.

439
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:33,698
We don't communicate anymore.
We're fighting all the time.

440
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,133
We... The only time we have sex is,

441
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,468
you know, when she's ovulating,

442
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:39,037
and even then, it's
cold. It's emotionless.

443
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,705
It's... I don't know.

444
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:41,806
Like an oil derrick.

445
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,808
We used to be very,
very spontaneous at that.

446
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,044
Now, it's... I don,t know.

447
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:48,613
Twice a week, tops.

448
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:49,948
That's a lot.

449
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:52,050
Is it? How often do you do it?

450
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,953
It's different now, 'cause
we got the kids, so...

451
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,154
So?

452
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:58,156
Well, my son falls
asleep in the bed with us.

453
00:20:58,157 --> 00:20:59,491
That shouldn't stop you.

454
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:00,825
That's disgusting.

455
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,427
I'm not saying he
should tickle your balls.

456
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,062
Just move him into his
room when he falls asleep.

457
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:06,664
Jason. I can really appreciate
what you're going through,

458
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,167
but, man, this couldn't
come at a worse time.

459
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:10,568
There's just no way
that we can pull away

460
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,936
from everything and go right now.

461
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,739
I'm sorry, but there's just
no way we can go on the trip.

462
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,740
I'm just scared, you know. Just scared.

463
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,912
You know, my whole life,
everything I've known about it

464
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:22,413
for the last eight years might be over,

465
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,582
and, you know, I'm
prepared to face that,

466
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,917
you know, if it,s for the best.

467
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:28,918
If, you know... If it's not
there anymore, then, you know,

468
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,189
I'll face it. I don't
want to do that alone.

469
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,190
And I know that Cynthia
doesn't want to do that alone.

470
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:37,362
You know, we'd just... We'd
love to have our friends there.

471
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:40,165
You know that if you go,
everyone else will go.

472
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,166
And I have never asked you for anything.

473
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:46,702
But I am asking you for this, Dave.

474
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,674
Daddy?

475
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,675
Hey, guys, the alarm
was just an accident.

476
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:55,380
You can go back to bed.
It's just Uncle Jason.

477
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:58,016
Okay, guys. It's fine. Let
me take you back to bed.

478
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:01,017
We want you to go on your trip.

479
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,221
We heard you talking at the party

480
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:05,890
and you said you
couldn't go because of us.

481
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,525
We don't want you guys to get a divorce.

482
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:08,726
What?

483
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,229
What are you talking about,
honey? We're not getting a divorce.

484
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,531
But we just want you to be happy.

485
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,300
Guys, we are happy.

486
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:17,569
We're very happy, honey.

487
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,570
Were you guys listening to
Uncle Jason's slide show?

488
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,409
Thank you, buddy. That's great.

489
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,011
That was adult time.

490
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,247
And why do you think they
were listening, Jason?

491
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,015
I'm sorry about that.

492
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,016
We want you to go, so we called
Grandpa to come take care of us.

493
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,021
You called Grandpa?

494
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,924
You called him tonight?
It's a three-hour drive.

495
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,026
Grandpa's coming to babysit us.

496
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,395
Is Grandpa driving down here now?

497
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,198
Yay! Grandpa Jim Jim's here!

498
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:51,603
You know, this has
gotten way out of hand.

499
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:54,239
I'm sorry. I just... I wanted five
minutes of your time. I'm so sorry.

500
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,573
You got... You got kids, you got guns,

501
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:56,841
you got grandpas that, you know...

502
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,842
You got to explain infertility
and divorce and all that,

503
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:01,679
and so you got a lot of
parenting to do tonight.

504
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,015
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna
let myself out right here.

505
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:05,450
I will, however, take the fact that

506
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:08,451
Grandpa Jim Jim's at the front
door as a firm, tentative yes.

507
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,457
Pack lots of shorts.
It's really hot there.

508
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:15,458
You're gonna sweat your
bag off. Night-night, kids!

509
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:49,494
Hi. Welcome.

510
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,329
Thank you.

511
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,330
This place is beautiful.

512
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,833
Look. Hi, hello.

513
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,670
Holy shit, this looks like
a screen saver! Thanks.

514
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:01,139
Seems like he might be kind
of the guy. Come on, gang.

515
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,841
Hi, we are the Smith
party. Party of eight.

516
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:04,976
Eight for Smith.

517
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:06,077
Jason Smith?

518
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:07,178
That's me.

519
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,781
Welcome to Eden.

520
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,782
My name is Sctanley. Spelled with a "C".

521
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:16,485
I will be escorting you
to the Eden West resort.

522
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,190
Please, step aboard our shuttle.

523
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:22,191
No need to take your bags. They will
be waiting for you in your villas.

524
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:40,009
Excuse me. Sorry. Is this the
shuttle for the Eden resort?

525
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,014
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's the shuttle.

526
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:45,383
Raq, she's still a little
buzzed from the flight.

527
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:48,052
Man, totally. Me, too. I
don't even know what I'm doing.

528
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,722
Excuse me. What name are your
reservations booked under?

529
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:52,523
The San Diego Dance Academy.

530
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:53,658
Wow.

531
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,293
Ah. You ladies are actually travelling

532
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:57,628
on this shuttle, to Eden East.

533
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:00,331
Bummer. Bye.

534
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,300
See you. Bye.

535
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:05,301
Bye.

536
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,138
Would you care to join your wife?

537
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:08,406
Let's do it. Shall we?

538
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:09,741
Are they going some place else?

539
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:12,742
Eden East. It is an
entirely different resort.

540
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,430
It's beautiful.

541
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:33,698
And the luggage is
already in there, huh?

542
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,099
Yeah. This is yours.

543
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,267
Unbelievable.

544
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,535
The 101.
- Wow.

545
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,370
And we can jump right
out into this here?

546
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,105
You can do whatever you like.

547
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,240
Wow.

548
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:45,043
Look at the water.

549
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,277
Please. Thank you.

550
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:49,614
Wow. Wow.

551
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:51,682
I'm gonna check the bedroom. Okay, baby.

552
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,684
Look at this, baby.

553
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,019
Oh, my God. Look at this.

554
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,354
Welcome to your villa.

555
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:57,622
It keeps getting better, huh?

556
00:25:57,623 --> 00:26:00,191
It's like a little love hut.

557
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:01,292
Wow.

558
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:04,293
This is insane!

559
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:07,296
Honey, they got fish that you
can see here through the floor!

560
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:10,201
Baby, they got a hole
where you can see the fish!

561
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:13,202
Yeah, they got fish in here, too, baby!

562
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:15,640
Jason, this is dreamy.

563
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:17,975
Baby, you can jump right
in the ocean on this thing,

564
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,444
and they got a hot tub on the deck!

565
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:21,946
They got the ocean and
they got the hot tub!

566
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,815
You can dive in the ocean
and you got a hot tub!

567
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:26,651
Yeah, they got a hot tub in here, too!

568
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,888
Oh, my God. Yo, I gotta
take a picture of this.

569
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:32,924
Did I tell you? Did
I deliver? Oh, my God.

570
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,892
She ain't never seen nothing like this.

571
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,094
I roll like this! Shit, yeah!

572
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,595
I'm glad you like, sir.

573
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,331
I be rolling like this.

574
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,633
So what goes on over
there? I hear there's music.

575
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,902
Is a party for single
woman and men, sir.

576
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,671
Yes. How do l get over there?

577
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:48,573
No, you cannot. You can
take the boat if you want,

578
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:50,508
but not for you. Okay,
when's the boat? Not for me.

579
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:52,243
No, because you got married here,

580
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:55,079
the west coast to Eden Resort
so that's why you must keep here.

581
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,148
I don't understand what you're
saying. You sound like Chewbacca.

582
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:58,683
Well, my instinct is
to stay married to her,

583
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:00,151
but what do you think I should do?

584
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:02,787
I mean, do you get a good vibe
from us or not-so-good vibe?

585
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:03,855
I don't know, sir.

586
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,523
What about this room, in particular?

587
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:07,091
You've checked a lot
of people into this room

588
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,593
and checked a lot of people out.

589
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:11,594
Do they usually leave
happier or less happy?

590
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:13,097
I really don't know, sir.

591
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,665
How do I get over to the party?

592
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:15,700
By boat or by taxi boat.

593
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:17,201
Okay. I'd like to arrange
a boat or a taxi boat.

594
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,436
No, it's not possible for you.

595
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:19,770
Must to stay here with your wife.

596
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:20,972
Okay, so how do I...

597
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,540
Fish!

598
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:23,875
Hello.

599
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:25,877
Where's the television? The main house.

600
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:27,879
There's no TV in the
room? No, not possible.

601
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,313
But it's the playoffs.

602
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,515
As an alternative to television,

603
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:33,451
might I recommend a stroll
to the hidden waterfall?

604
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:35,219
Might you recommend
putting honey in my ears

605
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,654
and having me fall asleep on an anthill?

606
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,489
It's the playoffs.

607
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,490
Honey, the waterfall sounds
amazing. A little romance.

608
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:44,527
You'll find that the Eden program
creates a palace of solitude,

609
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:47,398
if you just give yourself over to it.

610
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,733
How's the cell service here?

611
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:51,734
Monsieur Marcel believes that
technology is a distraction.

612
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:54,172
Well, how about tipping,
would that be a distraction?

613
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,506
I'm kidding you.

614
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,075
Tipping is not permitted,
nor is money of any kind.

615
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:00,411
Everything here in Eden is free.

616
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:01,546
Really?

617
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:04,547
We do, however, accept smiles.

618
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,592
Did you guys hear what
they have in the spa?

619
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:15,726
With the snow?

620
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:18,727
Did you know that they have a
steam, a rain, and a snow room here?

621
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,598
It's a new European spa.

622
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,999
What's a wahoo?

623
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,569
It's a fish.

624
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,237
I don't eat fish.

625
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:28,039
It's out of this world.
They catch it right here.

626
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,840
I used to work at Red Lobster,

627
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,841
so I know what they do with
them fish in the kitchen.

628
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,780
But, baby, this is not like the Red
Lobster. It's a four-star restaurant.

629
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:38,216
I don't give a shit! It's
still Mexicans cooking that shit

630
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,451
and I know what they do to it!

631
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,452
I'm one-twelfth Latina, and
even if I wasn't, I'm 100% human,

632
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,457
so I don't appreciate
comments like that.

633
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,960
I don't make fun of tu
la raza, so porfavor,

634
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:51,462
please, don't make fun of mi la raza-

635
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,463
Oh, I'm sorry, boo. I
didn't mean no disrespect.

636
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:57,866
Yo, I was with mad Mexicans
before Shane, anyway.

637
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,139
Good evening. I trust
you're all settled in.

638
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:05,910
Hey, my main man!

639
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,411
Are you in the mood
to accept some smiles?

640
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,713
"Cause this spread is phenomenal.

641
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:10,715
Why don't you join us for a
drink? You want to pull up a chair?

642
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:11,816
We'll order some shots.

643
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:13,985
You might want to go easy on
those. You have an early morning.

644
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,152
Quite the contrary.

645
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:16,454
I don't have an early morning,

646
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:18,823
'cause I tell you what's
gonna go down tonight.

647
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:21,792
I am going to get just
a little bit tipsy.

648
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,793
And then I'm gonna go ahead and
stuff my face on the Seafood Tower,

649
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,065
and I plan on shutting
it down in a big way.

650
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,902
l, if everything goes
well, will be in my room,

651
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:34,639
passed out on my face, come lunch-ski.

652
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,108
Well, I'm afraid that
isn't going to be possible.

653
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,577
I'm here to present
you with your itinerary.

654
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:41,646
Fantastic. You guys hear that?

655
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:43,681
This is a hard copy thing, too.

656
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:45,016
This is not like... This isn't like

657
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:46,350
a piece of paper with an itinerary.

658
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:47,818
No. This is like a book.

659
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:50,819
Thanks. And the journey begins.

660
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,795
Couples Skill Building at 6:00 a.m.?

661
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:02,867
Yeah, see, I was
planning on sleeping in,

662
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:04,969
and then maybe hitting the jet skis.

663
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,872
That is not part of your immediate
program here at Eden West.

664
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:09,874
But it was in the slide show. Uh-huh.

665
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:12,677
That would be more
appropriate at the Eden East.

666
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:13,711
What's Eden East?

667
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,012
The singles' resort.

668
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:16,714
Singles" resort?

669
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:19,483
Here at the Eden West, our
focus is on renewing bonds

670
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,053
and nurturing neglected partnerships.

671
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:23,888
And what's your focus over there?

672
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:26,889
Sex, mostly.

673
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,492
Freeing inhibitions.

674
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,627
I'm sure if we play our cards right'

675
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:30,995
we'll be having plenty
of sex here on our side.

676
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,864
Am I wrong, gang?

677
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,865
I spent three years of
therapy with Jennifer,

678
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,804
talking about our
feelings and our problems,

679
00:30:39,805 --> 00:30:41,505
trying to hold onto our marriage.

680
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,741
The last thing I want to do is talk.

681
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:45,810
Look, I think there's been
a misunderstanding here.

682
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:47,912
See, we signed up for the fun stuff,

683
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:50,014
with the touchy-feely
shit being optional.

684
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,148
Thank you.

685
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,416
I think it's called the Pelican Package.

686
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,085
Yes, the Pelican Package,

687
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:57,021
which is monsieur
Marcel's signature course.

688
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,155
Great.

689
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:01,156
A healthy combination of
couple-friendly activities,

690
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,827
ample down time... That's the one.

691
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:05,563
...sprinkled in with some
Couples Skill Building courses,

692
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,832
designed to reignite the dimming flames

693
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:10,768
of even the most
mismanaged relationships.

694
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:13,769
Okay, see, these relationships
are not mismanaged.

695
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,406
Well, thank you, Dave. Yes.

696
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:17,775
Yeah. I'm just saying
we're here to have some fun,

697
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:19,844
so we are excited about
the couples' activities,

698
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:21,078
as well as some down time.

699
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:24,079
It's the flame-lighting thing
that does not have us inspired.

700
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,851
That's more suited for
this particular couple here.

701
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:29,286
I don't think you're
quite understanding me.

702
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,756
Monsieur Marcel's Pelican Package

703
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:34,757
is not a fast-food restaurant wherein

704
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,895
you pick what you want from a menu.

705
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,398
Monsieur Marcel is the
single most-recognized

706
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,399
couples whisperer in the entire world.

707
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:44,735
Couple whisperer?

708
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,638
He has studied
psychology, yoga, tai chi,

709
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:50,639
The Art of War, and combined
them to form this place, Eden.

710
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:54,912
The Mecca for couples. Mmm.

711
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,882
He has designed a program
specifically for you.

712
00:31:57,883 --> 00:32:00,883
You either partake of the
entire meal or have none of it.

713
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:05,554
I think you're being a little
extreme here, Mr. Belvedere.

714
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,828
We have a very long waiting list.

715
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:12,563
If there's been some
kind of misunderstanding,

716
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:15,564
I'd be happy to refund your
money, and you can go on your way.

717
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:19,334
We will, however, not be
able to refund your airfare.

718
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:21,338
No, it's just that we were excited

719
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,407
about the sightseeing and the hiking

720
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,443
and the jet skiing and
the snorkeling. It's...

721
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:26,777
Well, there are plenty of places

722
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,013
that provide those activities.

723
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:31,415
Perhaps this troupe
might be more comfortable

724
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:34,416
at a Sandals or a Club Med.

725
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,786
This here is monsieur Marcel's Eden.

726
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,292
Now, if you're not at Couples
Skill Building by 6:00 a.m.,

727
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,863
I'll take that as you want your refund

728
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:48,864
and will not be completing the program.

729
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:55,671
Screw him! Where does he get
the ass to run down Sandals?

730
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:57,007
Sandals rocks.

731
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,476
It's just one little
thing we have to do.

732
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:01,477
It'll be over in a few hours and
then we have fun the rest of the day.

733
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,881
You know, let's just
not forget why we came.

734
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:05,149
This is not what we signed up for!

735
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,350
This is not what we signed up for.

736
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:07,685
I don't remember ever
seeing 'mandatory,"

737
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:08,953
but, listen, we just go with it.

738
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:11,954
Now we're on Han's Island about
to do the thing with Bruce Lee.

739
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,658
Guys, guys, I don't think
there's any reason to overreact

740
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,726
right off the bat, okay?

741
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:16,961
Obviously, the meal is included,

742
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:18,696
from what he said, so
let's just sit here,

743
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:21,697
we'll weigh the pros and cons from
a calm place, we'll make a decision.

744
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,902
That was amazing.

745
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:27,903
Oh, might have been the
best meal I've ever had.

746
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:30,808
Well, could be a full week of those.

747
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:32,710
What are you doing? Your last course.

748
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,411
Dessert.

749
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,718
It is so beautiful here. I can't
wait to go see that waterfall.

750
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:43,719
The weather is perfect, we got huts
on the water, and now I am eating art.

751
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,391
So we give up a little bit of
our day to talk about feelings.

752
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,392
How bad can it really be, right?

753
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:07,843
Welcome to Eden Resort.

754
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:10,447
I am Marcel.

755
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,283
Hi. Morning.

756
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:15,284
I know why you are all here.

757
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:19,023
You are here to seek the answer

758
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:22,024
to the most commonly
asked question by all,

759
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,563
how do we make it work?

760
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,734
How?

761
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:37,306
I have laid out a personalized program

762
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:42,477
designed to challenge you all,

763
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:46,114
both as couples and as individuals.

764
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:52,621
If you follow diligently my program,

765
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:56,491
the answer to this question
will be revealed to you,

766
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:59,494
as well as your inner animal spirit.

767
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:03,999
This I promise.

768
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:12,174
I do not, however, promise
that you and your chosen partner

769
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,778
will have what it takes to sustain it.

770
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:25,087
Please, line up on the beach.

771
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:26,991
Take your places.

772
00:35:26,992 --> 00:35:28,025
Out here?

773
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:31,026
This way. Men on one
line, facing the ocean.

774
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,796
Women, back to the water.

775
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:41,036
Now remove your mask.

776
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:47,811
Undress!

777
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,847
Oh. All right.

778
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:51,382
It's a freeing exercise.

779
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:52,683
This is starting to
get a little creepy now.

780
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:55,219
It'd mean a lot to me if you"d just
take your pants off, all right, Dave?

781
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,320
Is that why you brought me here?

782
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:59,321
This is... What is this?

783
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,567
You must undress, my friend.

784
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,703
I'm afraid that's not a option
for me today, you know, man.

785
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,805
It's the program.

786
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:17,074
Right. I don't have any drawers, though.

787
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:19,410
Well, Sctanley said he had this
conversation with you last night.

788
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:22,411
Now, if you've chosen to stay,
you've chosen to participate.

789
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,081
Now, if you're not wearing any drawers,

790
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:27,082
then, hey, that was meant to be.

791
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:30,419
Let it all hang out.

792
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:36,091
Explore. Explore with your eyes.

793
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:40,062
Explore your mate.

794
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,100
We are all made in God's image.

795
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:45,436
That means we are all perfect.

796
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:48,437
Stand with pride. Look
closer. Own your bodies.

797
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:54,776
And now, tell your partner
a truth. A beautiful truth.

798
00:36:58,183 --> 00:36:59,383
You look like the earth.

799
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,418
What?

800
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,519
Why are you listening
to what I'm saying?

801
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,620
Why don't you have
your own conversation?

802
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,889
It's hard to have my own conversation
when you're telling Cynthia

803
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,957
that she looks like the earth.

804
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,125
Did you hear what I said?

805
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:09,626
Yeah. I'm not really
sure I like that one.

806
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:11,962
Well, I just mean that, you
know, you look bountiful. Okay?

807
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,797
Fruitful. Fertile.

808
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:16,100
Okay. Now this is getting uncomfortable.

809
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:19,101
Please, make a palace of solitude
between you and your partner.

810
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:25,642
Why are you wearing trousers?

811
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:29,246
I explained to the guy in the dress

812
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,148
that I didn't have any drawers on.

813
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:34,149
Yes, but this exercise
is about owning your body.

814
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,386
Mmm.

815
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,455
What is your name, dear?

816
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:39,723
Trudy.

817
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,724
Trudy. What a beautiful name.

818
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,927
Please, tell him that you love his body.

819
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,000
For real? Yes.

820
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,268
I love your body.

821
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,503
Really?

822
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:54,938
Of course! So powerful, so strong.

823
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,939
Powerful frame with layer upon
layer of dormant, relaxed muscle,

824
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,410
waiting, like a panther, to
pounce on its quivering prey.

825
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:08,350
Please, take off his pants. Yes.

826
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,657
I'm not ready to pounce today.

827
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:14,758
Yes.

828
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,627
I don't have any drawers.
No. No. Right here, baby.

829
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,128
It's okay. It's okay. Hair!

830
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,631
Sorry, I'm sorry. Careful.

831
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,600
Here it comes. Here it comes.

832
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:28,770
Wonderful! Stare at
it! Stare at all of it.

833
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,340
Is his junk out?

834
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:31,508
Yep.

835
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:32,943
Is his junk literally out of his pants?

836
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:34,111
Yep.

837
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:37,112
Now it's a party.

838
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:48,123
How would you describe
your relationship?

839
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:49,393
Average. Great, yeah.

840
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:51,161
Great. Average. I mean, yeah.

841
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,162
And, to clarify, what is an
"average, great" relationship?

842
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,332
Well, we... We make it through
things pretty good together.

843
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,136
You know, we have two great kids.

844
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:01,238
No one's called 911 in
the middle of the night.

845
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,176
Like there's not domestic
violence in the... The... Yeah.

846
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:12,249
Ronnie, when you say you 'make
it through things together,"

847
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,650
what do you mean?

848
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:16,651
Well, you know, the
usual stuff. Work, kids.

849
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,356
I'm much less interested
in "the usual stuff"

850
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,525
and much more interested
in your particular stuff.

851
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:24,526
So, what do you make it
through together, specifically?

852
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,364
Well, right now, specifically,

853
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,571
Dave is dealing with his new launch

854
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:37,572
of his video game, Guitar Hero.

855
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,376
He sells Guitar Hero.

856
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,377
And I am dealing with the renovations.

857
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:43,747
That's interesting.

858
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:44,948
What's interesting?

859
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:47,718
Why do you keep writing stuff
down on your little pad there?

860
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,719
Oh, I'm taking notes.

861
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,458
Would it make you more
comfortable if I didn't take notes?

862
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:56,460
Yeah, actually, it would
make me more comfortable.

863
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:57,561
Thank you.

864
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:00,562
That's interesting.

865
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,800
So we want to make the most
of our time here on the island,

866
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:06,270
so what we did was we put together
a little informational packet

867
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:08,572
to bring you up to speed
on our relationship.

868
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:09,907
Go ahead. That's for you.

869
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,808
It just contains pertinent medical data,

870
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,710
family histories, you
know, stuff like that.

871
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:16,711
Everything but a mix tape.

872
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,981
How would you
characterize your marriage?

873
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,985
Perfect.

874
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,888
Fantastic.

875
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:27,889
Well, let's start with
something easy, then.

876
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,827
What's your favorite
thing about your partner?

877
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:32,629
Uh...

878
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,097
She's a good mom.

879
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,266
He really is a great dad.

880
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,734
And where did you meet?

881
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:40,735
School. High school. High school. Yeah.

882
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:44,306
She was a cheerleader
- I was on the football team. Fullback.

883
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,743
I coach now, but I used to play.

884
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,744
And we had... We actually
had our daughter... We...

885
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:54,683
On prom night, we conceived Lacey

886
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,587
and it was a little confusing at
the time, but it's been a blessing.

887
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,022
It's been the best thing
that's ever happened to us.

888
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:00,424
It's been the best thing
that ever happened to us.

889
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:01,792
We did the right thing.

890
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:04,793
How often do you have sex?

891
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:08,596
She wants me to be
tougher, screw harder.

892
00:41:10,368 --> 00:41:12,536
Work less, but bring home more.

893
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:14,705
I can't keep this shit straight.

894
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:17,706
All I know is, whatever I
do, it's not good enough. Mmm.

895
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,678
It's over.

896
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,647
Then why are you here?

897
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,516
This is not my wife. This is
Trudy. I met her a couple weeks ago.

898
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:29,517
Can we go boogie boarding now?

899
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,855
And once people knew what
we were going through,

900
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,856
I think my cortisol levels
just shot up through the roof.

901
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:39,029
Because it's difficult to go through

902
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:42,030
a very private struggle publicly.

903
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,069
I heard what you think,

904
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,738
but you know what I'm
really interested in

905
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:50,739
is hearing about how you feel.

906
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:53,410
Just tell her how you feel.

907
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:54,911
Well, I think if you
looked at everything that...

908
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,912
No, no, no, no. Just... Don't
explain intellectually how you feel.

909
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,349
You know, just tell her
how you feel. In one word.

910
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,220
Sure.

911
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,258
Angry.

912
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:11,259
Cynthia?

913
00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:13,530
Judged.

914
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,898
Very good.

915
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,267
Yes? Progress.

916
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:18,368
Excited.

917
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,270
Relieved.

918
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,505
That is it. Yeah.

919
00:42:21,506 --> 00:42:22,606
We're awesome at feelings!

920
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:25,008
Okay. Nice job today, guys.

921
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:26,610
That's all for today? Great
job. That's all for today.

922
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:27,744
All right, well, great. Yeah.

923
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,446
How did we do? Did we do good?

924
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:30,781
I mean, are we gonna make it?

925
00:42:30,782 --> 00:42:33,250
Well, you know, it's just
our first session, you know.

926
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:35,919
We're not looking for an end
result here. It's not a competition.

927
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,789
I get all that, but have you seen
couples that are worse off than us?

928
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,624
Yeah. Or are we that far gone?

929
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:42,626
We're... Are you gonna put a...
Like a numerical value on it?

930
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:44,127
You know, Doc? Like a one to 10?

931
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:45,629
One being worst, 10 being best?

932
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,631
No, hang on one second.
Where would you put us?

933
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:49,599
Right where you are, sir.

934
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,401
What if someone put a gun to
your head right now and said,

935
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,370
"You have to answer this
second or I'll shoot.

936
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:55,205
"Are they gonna make
it?" What do you say?

937
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:56,273
What would you say?

938
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:59,274
Whoa! Okay, no one has a
gun to my head, Mr. Smith.

939
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:00,644
It's hypothetical.

940
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:02,546
It's not a place for
inappropriate behavior.

941
00:43:02,547 --> 00:43:05,449
And you definitely don't pull a
hypothetical gun on your therapist.

942
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:06,583
Sorry.

943
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,717
It's okay.

944
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:09,286
Let's clear the karma. Okay?

945
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:11,154
I'll holster this.

946
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:12,756
See, you know, I work 10 hours a day,

947
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:14,257
so by the time I come
home, I'm exhausted.

948
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,893
It's not that I don't want to answer
questions about the house renovation.

949
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:19,396
I really just don't want to
answer questions about anything.

950
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:22,232
But, you know, you may just
be shutting your mind off,

951
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:25,233
but it can feel like you're
shutting your partner off as well.

952
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,504
Again, that's a caution area.

953
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:29,106
And just as a point of interest,

954
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,674
when you speak that way, David,

955
00:43:30,675 --> 00:43:33,675
you're really
de-prioritizing your teammate.

956
00:43:33,678 --> 00:43:34,811
Excuse me?

957
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:37,314
It's called "crossing
emotional boundaries."

958
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:40,315
Or, more commonly,
"bulldozing." And it's ugly.

959
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:44,855
Ronnie, when you spoke earlier of...

960
00:43:44,856 --> 00:43:47,856
Let me just find it in my notes here.

961
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:57,198
There it is+ You said, "We make
it through things well together."

962
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,203
That doesn't sound very fun.

963
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:03,204
You don't want to look back and
say, "I made it through my life."

964
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:06,875
We want to enjoy our
projects, enjoy our work week.

965
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:10,378
We want to enjoy our
lives, celebrate our lives.

966
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:12,182
And all this talk about my project

967
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:14,718
and his work, and my this and his that,

968
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,487
and mine and his, and
mine and... It,s...

969
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,890
Where's us in all that?

970
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:22,891
Where is our journey? I don't hear it.

971
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:25,562
And it's because it's not there.

972
00:44:25,563 --> 00:44:27,564
Listen. I'm not saying that there's not

973
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:29,466
some really stressful times sometimes,

974
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:31,501
because there is, but it works for us.

975
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,337
Does it?

976
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:37,338
I don't know.

977
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:40,408
Oh, gosh, I don't know, you guys.

978
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,913
There's no "us." There's no "we."

979
00:44:42,914 --> 00:44:45,914
You two could be perfect strangers.

980
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,250
I think the one thing that
we can agree on, today,

981
00:44:50,922 --> 00:44:53,922
is that you guys should be doing
a lot better than just "works."

982
00:44:57,161 --> 00:45:00,161
Pretty sure that's why you're here.

983
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:03,264
Oh. That's it. Great. Great
job, everybody. Thank you.

984
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,489
Lucy?

985
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,462
Good day, sir. I got room
service for you. I'm very sorry.

986
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:45,368
I didn't order that.

987
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:48,369
I think your wife,
she called me for you.

988
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:51,274
I'm...

989
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:53,043
This is just... Because I got a sunburn,

990
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:54,377
'cause it was... The sun
was very strong today.

991
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:56,112
Yeah. I know. This is
good for sunburns, right?

992
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:57,213
No. Okay.

993
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:58,381
It's good, yeah?

994
00:46:58,382 --> 00:46:59,849
It's good for sunburn?

995
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,217
Okay, so I don't see anything.

996
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:02,519
See what? There's nothing to see.

997
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,720
Yeah, yeah, no, no, no. It works great.

998
00:47:03,721 --> 00:47:05,121
Okay, I move now. No. That was.
- That was...

999
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:08,122
There's nothing to move.
I... I was... I had a sunburn.

1000
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:13,161
Good night, sir.

1001
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:43,725
Now we will enjoy looking at the fish!

1002
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:46,262
See and take in with your eyes

1003
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:49,263
all the beauty the ocean has to offer!

1004
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:52,736
As these new things come at you,

1005
00:47:52,737 --> 00:47:55,071
you may not have seen them before,

1006
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:58,072
but be open to them and
find the beauty within.

1007
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:00,577
Hey, buddy. Yep.

1008
00:48:00,578 --> 00:48:02,746
Thanks a lot for bringing
me to Problem Island.

1009
00:48:02,747 --> 00:48:04,013
What are we gonna do for an encore?

1010
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,282
Talk about all the people that we
slept with before we were married

1011
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:07,517
and really stir shit up?

1012
00:48:07,518 --> 00:48:08,718
What the hell are you talking about?

1013
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,620
The therapist is trying
to create a problem

1014
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:12,288
in my marriage that doesn't exist!

1015
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,124
Maybe he's not creating them,
maybe he's just noticing them.

1016
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:15,291
Okay, you know what?
Don't start with me.

1017
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:17,293
I'm serious. I don't need it.
These are the best in the world

1018
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:18,795
at what they do, all right?

1019
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:20,430
If Jeff Gordon told you
that your oil was low,

1020
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:22,132
you might want to
think about changing it.

1021
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:24,134
From the bucket, feed them!

1022
00:48:24,135 --> 00:48:25,935
My therapist is kind of pushy.

1023
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:27,036
Really? Yeah.

1024
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:28,471
God, I like ours.

1025
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:31,472
Yeah, he said that Dave and
I take each other for granted.

1026
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:34,809
That, you know, our relationship
has become more like a job.

1027
00:48:35,813 --> 00:48:37,046
How do you mean?

1028
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:40,047
For example, he says that
Dave is de-prioritizing me,

1029
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:43,084
that he doesn't pay attention
to what I actually want.

1030
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,489
Yeah, but, honey, that's just
Dave being Dave, you know?

1031
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:49,490
Yeah.

1032
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,560
But so then, what if Dave
being Dave is sort of like

1033
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:55,832
Dave bulldozing me?

1034
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:58,435
Please continue to look at the fish!

1035
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:01,104
Enjoy them as they come at you!

1036
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:03,440
I get it, dude, it's
advanced snorkeling.

1037
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:06,441
Dave... Hey, I'm trying
to do this exercise!

1038
00:49:07,011 --> 00:49:09,646
Why don't we talk about
this during down time, okay?

1039
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:11,848
This might be what the
therapist is referring to.

1040
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:13,283
You're missing out on life.

1041
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:16,186
It's happening right now, out
here, all around us, all right?

1042
00:49:16,187 --> 00:49:18,354
And you're too busy
complaining about your problems

1043
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:21,355
to enjoy all these beautiful
little fish that are...

1044
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,363
Marcel!

1045
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:28,498
Yes?

1046
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:30,533
Marcel, we have a real problem here!

1047
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:33,534
It is not a problem!
It is a circle of life!

1048
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,804
The circle of life is
circling our lives right now!

1049
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:40,107
Do not move, do not panic.

1050
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:42,345
Shark! What?

1051
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:43,513
Shark! Jason!

1052
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:45,381
Okay, it's all happening, Marcel!

1053
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:46,716
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1054
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:47,951
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God...

1055
00:49:47,952 --> 00:49:49,319
Don't worry! Wait!

1056
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,221
These are only lemon sharks!

1057
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:53,523
This is all part of the course.

1058
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:56,524
It is like life. Like in relationships.

1059
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,560
They will not attack
unless they feel attacked!

1060
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:02,730
Marcel, I need you to take
the French out of your mouth

1061
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,468
and tell me what to do!

1062
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,804
Don't let them see your fear.

1063
00:50:07,805 --> 00:50:10,507
Okay, I think we just hold
tight, we play it cool,

1064
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:13,309
we don't make a move.

1065
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:14,410
What was that? What?

1066
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:17,411
What was that? Jason, stop...

1067
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:20,581
He said not to panic!
He said not to panic!

1068
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:23,486
I'm sitting in blood!
I'm sitting in blood!

1069
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:25,722
Marcel, this isn't a drill, buddy!

1070
00:50:25,723 --> 00:50:28,723
You got real sharks here!
It's time to get the guns'

1071
00:50:28,826 --> 00:50:30,760
and it's time to shoot some fish!

1072
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,695
Here on Eden, there are no guns!

1073
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,764
You got an American life at stake.

1074
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:37,765
One life is not more
important than another.

1075
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,269
What do I do?

1076
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,538
My friends and my wife left me to die.

1077
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:44,539
You must get out of
the chum, but slowly.

1078
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:46,209
Okay.

1079
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,677
Swim slowly out of the chum!

1080
00:50:47,678 --> 00:50:49,245
Slowly. Slowly. Yes, yes.

1081
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:51,381
Slowly, baby! Stop!

1082
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,049
I don't know what to do.

1083
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,118
I don't know if I'm standing
still or I'm swimming.

1084
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,119
Swim now! Stop!

1085
00:50:59,123 --> 00:51:00,790
They're torturing me!
They're playing with me!

1086
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:03,693
They're slow-playing me! Shoot them!

1087
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:06,694
Swim slowly.

1088
00:51:08,966 --> 00:51:11,966
Swim, swim, swim.

1089
00:51:16,874 --> 00:51:19,874
Save yourselves! Go to
shore! It's too late!

1090
00:51:22,146 --> 00:51:25,146
They've got me! It's
only a matter of time!

1091
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:28,382
There's no sharks around you,
honey. You're safe now, baby.

1092
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:31,552
I don't know what's going through
my mind! I'd love some ice cream.

1093
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:33,156
What? I'd love some ice cream,

1094
00:51:33,157 --> 00:51:36,157
with maybe some pecans in it!

1095
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:40,227
Couples' massage is part of
your program and so important.

1096
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:43,598
It gives you the chance
to bond, relax, reconnect.

1097
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:46,834
We prefer to bond on our own.

1098
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:50,338
Okay, would you prefer
male or female therapists?

1099
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:54,675
What would you recommend more for like
a nurturing, pampering, motherly energy?

1100
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:57,347
Would that be a man or
a woman, do you think?

1101
00:51:57,348 --> 00:51:58,481
A woman.

1102
00:51:58,482 --> 00:52:01,482
Well, I'm just so tight in my
shoulders. Do you have any...

1103
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:04,520
Let me see.

1104
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:07,521
We do have a male
masseur available, madam.

1105
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,360
Daddy, I can't wait to
get my drink on tonight!

1106
00:52:13,998 --> 00:52:16,998
Damn! Is this whole thing
uphill? Where's the downhill part?

1107
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:21,137
We gonna get our groove
on tonight. Right, Daddy?

1108
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:24,138
Of course, baby. You know how we do it.

1109
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:26,376
Well, hello.

1110
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:29,377
Hi.

1111
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,280
Lucy.

1112
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:32,382
Yes.

1113
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,483
Excellent.

1114
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:34,951
Who are you?

1115
00:52:34,952 --> 00:52:37,854
I am Xavier and I will be
your man-seur for today.

1116
00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:38,888
Xavier?

1117
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,056
Yes.

1118
00:52:40,057 --> 00:52:43,026
Mmm.

1119
00:52:43,027 --> 00:52:45,962
Twenty, 30, 40, 50...

1120
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:49,732
Hi.

1121
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:50,800
Joey.

1122
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:52,568
Yes.

1123
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:53,836
What's your name?

1124
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:54,971
Gert.

1125
00:52:54,972 --> 00:52:56,305
What a beautiful name.

1126
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,641
Well, thank you.

1127
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:00,677
Do you mind if I heat up the lotion?

1128
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,879
No. Heat that lotion up.

1129
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,880
The hotter the better.

1130
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:21,898
What kind of massage do
you want? You left it blank.

1131
00:53:21,899 --> 00:53:23,199
Korean?

1132
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,200
Korean? I am not familiar with Korean.

1133
00:53:26,737 --> 00:53:29,737
Dealer's choice. Whatever
releases the most tension.

1134
00:53:33,077 --> 00:53:36,077
Mmm.

1135
00:53:36,113 --> 00:53:39,113
Oh, that feels so good.

1136
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,550
Thank you.

1137
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:43,551
I can't tell you how much I need
this. It has been a long time.

1138
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:48,057
Oh, I love pleasuring people.

1139
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,225
So do l.

1140
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:52,226
I mean, it's not my job,

1141
00:53:53,197 --> 00:53:56,197
but it is a job that I love
doing, if you know what I mean.

1142
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:02,271
I know exactly what you mean.

1143
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:05,141
So, Joey, do you have any problem areas?

1144
00:54:05,142 --> 00:54:07,810
I hold a lot of tension
in my upper thighs.

1145
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:09,779
We'll get to your upper thighs.

1146
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,647
It's just the top of my quads.

1147
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:12,982
As a matter of fact,
if you want to do, like,

1148
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:15,318
the full 80 minutes on
the thighs, I'm good.

1149
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:16,586
Whatever you want.

1150
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:19,587
Oh, I need this. You have no idea.

1151
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:23,292
Oh, you got great hands.

1152
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:26,293
Okay, Joey, what I want you to
do for me is just close your eyes.

1153
00:54:28,065 --> 00:54:30,066
Quiet that mind, okay?

1154
00:54:30,067 --> 00:54:31,768
Just listen to my voice.

1155
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:34,769
Feel the sound slide down my throat

1156
00:54:37,174 --> 00:54:40,174
and come out through my mouth.

1157
00:54:40,344 --> 00:54:43,344
Down my throat, come
out through my mouth.

1158
00:54:47,351 --> 00:54:50,351
Down my throat...

1159
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,125
Keep... Keep going, keep going.

1160
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,693
Sir, I'm so sorry.

1161
00:54:57,694 --> 00:55:00,694
No, no, no. Don't be sorry.
You shouldn't be sorry.

1162
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,865
No, I aroused you.

1163
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:04,534
You should be proud.

1164
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:07,136
This hasn't happened
to me in a long time.

1165
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:10,137
Are you attempting to have a
manual stimulation from me, sir?

1166
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,142
Am I...

1167
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:16,143
I am here on a couples retreat
with my wife in the other room.

1168
00:55:18,115 --> 00:55:20,149
My husband Scott is just like a cat.

1169
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,450
Scott?

1170
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:24,187
My husband.

1171
00:55:24,188 --> 00:55:27,188
I'm trying to save my marriage
here. Look what you did to me.

1172
00:55:28,225 --> 00:55:29,892
Well, that wasn't my intention, sir.

1173
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:31,828
It wasn't mine, either,
and now I'm humiliated.

1174
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:32,962
Well, I'm sorry.

1175
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:34,897
You told me not to think.

1176
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:36,699
Well, when I don't think,
this is what happens.

1177
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,634
You can't leave me all
backed up like this.

1178
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:40,203
What do you want me to do, sir?

1179
00:55:40,204 --> 00:55:42,338
I don't know. We got to
figure out a solution.

1180
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,140
You know, let's not take
anything off the table.

1181
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:47,141
Let's start brainstorming. We"re
both in a maze together, okay?

1182
00:55:48,412 --> 00:55:50,813
How do we get the cheese?

1183
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:53,814
I'm sorry, sir, but that is
not gonna have a happy ending.

1184
00:55:58,422 --> 00:56:01,422
Give me the oil.

1185
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:05,926
Go grab a smoke.

1186
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,732
Daddy, this is awesome!

1187
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:12,733
Yo, they should put me up
in a video on this bitch!

1188
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:16,170
Don't go chasing waterfalls

1189
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,440
Stick me in the ocean I'm
gonna make it look real good

1190
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:24,280
You go, girl.

1191
00:56:28,285 --> 00:56:30,453
Daddy's got to ice his knee, baby, okay?

1192
00:56:30,454 --> 00:56:32,755
If you just let me recharge my battery,

1193
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:35,591
I promise, this'll be
more for you later, okay?

1194
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:38,592
Technically, I was bit by a shark.

1195
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,930
Were you bit or were you nipped?

1196
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:42,131
I mean, if you had been bit,

1197
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:43,799
you probably would have lost
a great deal of blood and...

1198
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,968
What difference does it
make to you two, anyway,

1199
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:47,136
what you would call it?

1200
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:50,137
It hurt. And I had shark
teeth penetrate my skin.

1201
00:56:50,307 --> 00:56:52,475
And besides, Jason, it's
your fault that it happened.

1202
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:54,076
The only reason I got
bit in the first place

1203
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,611
is because you did the worst thing

1204
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:57,780
you could possibly do in that situation.

1205
00:56:57,781 --> 00:56:59,949
You panicked and you threw
a bucket of chum in my face.

1206
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,817
I did the prudent thing and I
got the hell out of the water.

1207
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:04,787
There were sharks in there,
David. What was I supposed to do?

1208
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:06,289
You know what? Remember
it however you want to

1209
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:08,090
and I'll remember it
how it actually happened.

1210
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,091
Dave. I mean, really, did
they penetrate your skin?

1211
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:12,561
Do you really need that bandage?

1212
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:15,264
Lucy, I don't know
what to tell you, okay?

1213
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:18,067
You tell me if I need the bandage.

1214
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:19,902
It looks like you scraped
yourself on the ladder,

1215
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:21,070
maybe, on the way out.

1216
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:22,171
I'm sorry?

1217
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:23,506
Did you get out of the water abruptly?

1218
00:57:23,507 --> 00:57:26,507
Hey, I don't know how to explain
it to you. Maybe I have tough skin.

1219
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:28,945
Perhaps lemon sharks don't
leave that bad of a mark.

1220
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:30,012
Maybe they're pack animals

1221
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:31,781
and they're marking me
for later. I don't know.

1222
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:33,849
Dave, I was in a car
accident once, okay?

1223
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,518
And it was really scary, I
had nightmares. But when...

1224
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:36,819
I've been in a car accident, too.

1225
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,020
Have you ever been bit by a shark?

1226
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:40,256
I was never bit by a shark. I'm
just saying that I understand. My...

1227
00:57:40,257 --> 00:57:42,325
Say it again. I was in a car accident.

1228
00:57:42,326 --> 00:57:43,492
No, say the last part.

1229
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:44,593
I was never bit by a shark.

1230
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:47,594
That's it! Then you
shouldn't talk about it.

1231
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:51,500
And I'm not gonna sit here
and try to explain myself

1232
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:54,003
to a bunch of black
and white suburban trash

1233
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:56,172
who don't know a damn
thing about the ocean.

1234
00:57:56,173 --> 00:57:57,807
And you understand the ocean, honey?

1235
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:59,442
I have some real field
experience, honey, yeah.

1236
00:57:59,443 --> 00:58:00,543
I had a shark attack.

1237
00:58:00,544 --> 00:58:02,511
I'm part of a very elite group.

1238
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:03,713
Like people who have
been struck by lightning.

1239
00:58:03,714 --> 00:58:04,981
Not everyone can say
that they've had that

1240
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:07,650
and maybe that's what's
going on here today.

1241
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:09,385
You know what? I don't want
to get in an argument with it.

1242
00:58:09,386 --> 00:58:11,220
I really don't. You know what?

1243
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:13,122
I'm really exhausted.
It's been a long day.

1244
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:16,123
I'm gonna go back to the
room. You want to come with me?

1245
00:58:17,361 --> 00:58:19,462
Baby, I thought we were gonna
go to the waterfall tonight

1246
00:58:19,463 --> 00:58:21,397
and have a little alone time.

1247
00:58:21,398 --> 00:58:23,833
Sweetheart, I'm a shark attack survivor.

1248
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,369
I'm fried.

1249
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:29,370
Honey, I think the fear was a
lot worse than the actual attack,

1250
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:31,874
which I can totally appreciate,

1251
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:33,809
but the good news is you weren't hurt,

1252
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:36,078
so let's not ruin the evening over it.

1253
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,713
I'm sorry?

1254
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:39,582
Honey, you weren't hurt.

1255
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,851
Good night.

1256
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:43,252
Dave! Where you going?

1257
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:44,720
Dave. Come on, okay,
you got bit by the shark.

1258
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:46,322
You got bit, I believe you!

1259
00:58:46,323 --> 00:58:49,323
We're here all the time, so let's
take that opportunity to go to bed.

1260
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:53,262
Honey, we'll go to
the waterfall with you.

1261
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:54,597
We'll grab our drinks and go.

1262
00:58:54,598 --> 00:58:57,433
Yeah. We could all go
together. It'll be beautiful.

1263
00:58:57,434 --> 00:59:00,369
Hon? I was thinking that maybe

1264
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,605
we might go back to the room, huh?

1265
00:59:02,606 --> 00:59:05,374
Bolt the door, draw the shades, huh?

1266
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,510
Just shut the whole world out

1267
00:59:07,511 --> 00:59:10,511
and sit Indian-style and
really explore our feelings.

1268
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:15,351
Daddy! Wake up!

1269
00:59:15,352 --> 00:59:17,286
It's too deep!

1270
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:20,287
Yo, you having a nightmare. You ain't
even in the water. It's night time.

1271
00:59:20,457 --> 00:59:23,457
Look, you said we was gonna have
fun, so let's get up, let's dance,

1272
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:27,296
let's do a shot, let's
do something. Anything.

1273
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:29,432
Baby, let's just go back
to the room, all right?

1274
00:59:29,433 --> 00:59:32,433
I don't want to go back to the
room. I don't want to go to sleep.

1275
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:34,470
We're not going to sleep.

1276
00:59:34,471 --> 00:59:35,638
We're not?

1277
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:37,206
Mmm-mmm.

1278
00:59:37,207 --> 00:59:39,075
What we gonna do in there?

1279
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,577
For real?

1280
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:01,865
So how was your night?

1281
01:00:01,866 --> 01:00:04,866
My husband found himself in a
very traumatic shark situation.

1282
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:06,603
Here we go.

1283
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:09,604
As we were planning to go to the
waterfall and have a romantic evening,

1284
01:00:10,141 --> 01:00:11,875
because, as you know, we
don't do that very often

1285
01:00:11,876 --> 01:00:13,544
because of the kids and work...

1286
01:00:13,545 --> 01:00:16,546
But somehow, this crazy,
traumatic shark experience

1287
01:00:16,682 --> 01:00:19,682
was enough to make him neglect his wife.

1288
01:00:21,187 --> 01:00:24,187
Ronnie, nice to meet you. Well said.

1289
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:26,792
David, how did that make you feel?

1290
01:00:26,793 --> 01:00:28,227
I know my truth.

1291
01:00:28,228 --> 01:00:30,029
Excuse me? I know my truth.

1292
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:32,965
Did you say, "l know my truth',?

1293
01:00:32,966 --> 01:00:34,867
Oh, boy.

1294
01:00:34,868 --> 01:00:37,869
Listen, I'm telling you,
you getting on my last nerve!

1295
01:00:38,172 --> 01:00:39,906
Yo, I didn't sign up for this!

1296
01:00:39,907 --> 01:00:41,675
Yo, you said we was gonna be dancing.

1297
01:00:41,676 --> 01:00:43,076
You said we was gonna be partying.

1298
01:00:43,077 --> 01:00:45,178
You said we was gonna
be doing what we do.

1299
01:00:45,179 --> 01:00:47,247
You made promises, Daddy.

1300
01:00:47,248 --> 01:00:50,184
Boo-Boo, look, they got me
doing a lot of activities.

1301
01:00:50,185 --> 01:00:51,386
What do you expect from me?

1302
01:00:51,387 --> 01:00:52,587
I'm tired.

1303
01:00:52,588 --> 01:00:54,922
You tired? Yo, I'm tired.

1304
01:00:54,923 --> 01:00:57,392
Plain and simple, I ain't having it.

1305
01:00:57,393 --> 01:01:00,393
Sometimes we forget how to do
the easiest thing in the world,

1306
01:01:02,365 --> 01:01:05,365
which is just to talk to each other.

1307
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:09,505
Okay, let's start here.
Lucy, you go first.

1308
01:01:09,506 --> 01:01:12,506
I want you to look at Joey and say hi.

1309
01:01:13,277 --> 01:01:14,544
And Joey, after you've heard that,

1310
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:17,545
I want you to look back at
Lucy and say hello in return.

1311
01:01:19,116 --> 01:01:22,116
And then we'll just see where
it goes from there, okay?

1312
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:32,394
Hi.

1313
01:01:32,431 --> 01:01:34,131
Hello.

1314
01:01:34,132 --> 01:01:37,133
You kept saying "open" and
"fruitful" and other weird stuff.

1315
01:01:38,404 --> 01:01:41,404
That's not feeling, it's just more
talking in short half-sentences,

1316
01:01:42,108 --> 01:01:45,108
and you managed to turn feeling
into a job or an activity,

1317
01:01:45,878 --> 01:01:47,612
and it was exhausting.

1318
01:01:47,613 --> 01:01:49,148
So now it's my fault that
you don't feel satisfied!

1319
01:01:49,149 --> 01:01:51,150
Everything is my fault?
Is that what you're saying?

1320
01:01:51,151 --> 01:01:53,119
I'm not saying that! I'm
crazy? You don't look at me!

1321
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,054
You don't ever ask me how I am! I work!

1322
01:01:55,055 --> 01:01:56,722
You haven't looked at me in 10 years!

1323
01:01:56,723 --> 01:01:58,658
I'm crazy and everything is my fault,

1324
01:01:58,659 --> 01:02:01,660
and my family is awful, and
nothing at all is your fault!

1325
01:02:02,897 --> 01:02:04,064
'Cause you rock, Joey!

1326
01:02:04,065 --> 01:02:06,166
If a guy talked to me like
that, I'd punch him in the face.

1327
01:02:06,167 --> 01:02:08,435
You're such an asshole!

1328
01:02:08,436 --> 01:02:09,970
You're an asshole!

1329
01:02:09,971 --> 01:02:12,339
It's like a little kid who
gets a puppy for the first time,

1330
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:15,341
just hugs it so much, snaps its neck.

1331
01:02:15,411 --> 01:02:16,511
Cynthia's your puppy.

1332
01:02:16,512 --> 01:02:17,979
It's puppy-cradle death syndrome.

1333
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:20,448
All that love is gonna snap that puppy.

1334
01:02:20,449 --> 01:02:21,516
Yeah, but... You don't want that!

1335
01:02:25,856 --> 01:02:28,856
The dawning of a new day.

1336
01:02:29,126 --> 01:02:32,126
A marriage is not a timeless agreement.

1337
01:02:32,462 --> 01:02:35,462
It is one day. And each
day, it begins anew.

1338
01:02:38,536 --> 01:02:41,536
Moments. Life is made of them,

1339
01:02:41,706 --> 01:02:44,706
much the same as a great mosaic.

1340
01:02:44,709 --> 01:02:47,709
A thousand little pieces
that make one great image.

1341
01:02:51,383 --> 01:02:54,383
But the most important
thing in life is...

1342
01:02:59,024 --> 01:03:02,025
And today, we open the door to breath

1343
01:03:02,462 --> 01:03:05,462
with a shared yoga group experience.

1344
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:08,532
Our instructor,
Salvadore, is running late.

1345
01:03:09,903 --> 01:03:12,739
So I will touch on tomorrow.

1346
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:15,740
It is very important that
you are here before sunrise,

1347
01:03:16,544 --> 01:03:19,544
as well as not eat or drink
anything too late tonight.

1348
01:03:21,382 --> 01:03:22,849
As you pursue knowledge,

1349
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:25,851
as well as your own
individual animal spirits,

1350
01:03:26,354 --> 01:03:29,354
it is very important that you
strictly follow your programs.

1351
01:03:30,725 --> 01:03:33,725
Failure to do so will
definitely take you off your path

1352
01:03:35,598 --> 01:03:38,598
and lead you away from
the answers you seek.

1353
01:03:38,734 --> 01:03:40,235
I'm sorry, monsieur Marcel.

1354
01:03:40,236 --> 01:03:42,437
Why is it so important for
us to be on time tomorrow

1355
01:03:42,438 --> 01:03:44,439
when Pablo, the yoga guy,
is running late today?

1356
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,107
Quiet, please.

1357
01:03:46,108 --> 01:03:49,109
The yoga teacher's punctuality
is not your concern.

1358
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:53,280
You are to be here before sunrise.

1359
01:03:58,121 --> 01:04:01,024
Why is it so important for us to be here
on time tomorrow? I'm not understanding.

1360
01:04:01,025 --> 01:04:02,426
Why can't we eat or drink tomorrow?

1361
01:04:02,427 --> 01:04:05,427
What, is he gonna probe us?

1362
01:04:13,872 --> 01:04:16,872
Who is that?

1363
01:04:19,044 --> 01:04:22,044
Oh, my.

1364
01:04:22,915 --> 01:04:25,916
Damn!

1365
01:04:25,986 --> 01:04:27,653
I guess that's the yoga guy.

1366
01:04:27,654 --> 01:04:29,922
This just gets better and better.

1367
01:04:29,923 --> 01:04:32,923
Well, hello. I am so sorry I'm late.

1368
01:04:32,993 --> 01:04:35,994
I just swam from the
other side of the island.

1369
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:39,163
Please, allow me to put on something
more proper before we can begin.

1370
01:04:39,934 --> 01:04:41,901
Thank God.

1371
01:04:41,902 --> 01:04:44,404
There we go. Much better.

1372
01:04:44,405 --> 01:04:46,339
Now, who is ready for their yoga?

1373
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,075
My name's Jason. Jason.

1374
01:04:48,076 --> 01:04:49,343
Pleasure, hi. Nice.

1375
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:50,411
Cynthia. Hi. Can't wait.

1376
01:04:50,412 --> 01:04:53,412
Hello, Cynthia.

1377
01:04:53,482 --> 01:04:56,482
Yes, we have a brave
peacock. Use that. Yes.

1378
01:04:57,252 --> 01:04:59,588
Yes. Hi, you must be Veronica. Hi.

1379
01:04:59,589 --> 01:05:00,989
Yeah, how did you know?

1380
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:03,990
Why, I have read that you have
studied the yoga for five years.

1381
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:07,460
Oh, well, I mean, just off and
on, you know, before the kids came.

1382
01:05:08,698 --> 01:05:11,699
Nonsense. You know, there is such
thing called the muscle memory?

1383
01:05:12,269 --> 01:05:15,269
And I could tell by looking at
your gait, your muscles remember.

1384
01:05:16,507 --> 01:05:17,974
Thank you. Yes.

1385
01:05:17,975 --> 01:05:20,975
Okay, we are going to do
the children's position.

1386
01:05:22,179 --> 01:05:23,280
What's that?

1387
01:05:23,281 --> 01:05:25,049
Head down, buttocks up.

1388
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:27,117
Everybody on your mats.

1389
01:05:27,118 --> 01:05:30,118
Yeah, that's good. That's
good. Very nice posture. Yes.

1390
01:05:32,657 --> 01:05:34,626
Encouragement.

1391
01:05:34,627 --> 01:05:37,627
So I will transfer you my
energy. I will transfer my karma.

1392
01:05:38,664 --> 01:05:40,565
Here is my karma on you.

1393
01:05:40,566 --> 01:05:41,866
Jason!

1394
01:05:41,867 --> 01:05:43,702
You have a great aura. Yes.

1395
01:05:43,703 --> 01:05:45,470
Jason! Encouragement!

1396
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:48,472
Yes! This is a great way to stretch.

1397
01:05:48,642 --> 01:05:50,142
Yep. You see?

1398
01:05:50,143 --> 01:05:51,711
You could do this with
your partner at home.

1399
01:05:51,712 --> 01:05:53,346
Sure. Let's ride this energy out!

1400
01:05:53,347 --> 01:05:54,914
Keep your chin up. Yep.

1401
01:05:54,915 --> 01:05:57,916
Yes, this fire has just started.
And we will not put it out.

1402
01:05:58,886 --> 01:06:00,087
What is he doing?

1403
01:06:00,088 --> 01:06:02,389
I don't really know that pose.

1404
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:04,925
Okay, now we go into
the happy baby pose.

1405
01:06:04,926 --> 01:06:07,194
No, no, no, no, no,
no. Please regard me.

1406
01:06:07,195 --> 01:06:08,929
I'm sorry? Please, allow me.

1407
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:10,164
To do what? Regard me.

1408
01:06:10,165 --> 01:06:11,933
Okay. Yes.

1409
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:13,067
Okay.

1410
01:06:13,068 --> 01:06:15,069
You are doing fantastic, my dear.

1411
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:16,671
Thank you. Okay.

1412
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:18,439
See as I gently pulsate.

1413
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,607
Okay...

1414
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:21,576
Trying to go deeper and deeper,

1415
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:24,578
and bring her deeper and
deeper into a stretch, yes?

1416
01:06:24,781 --> 01:06:26,949
Okay, Fabio, that's enough
of the pulsating. Please.

1417
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:29,950
Then do it! Yes!
Encouragement, my friend.

1418
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:35,022
Yes, fantastic progress.
Yes, put your shoulders back.

1419
01:06:37,628 --> 01:06:40,628
Yes. Now feel the energy.
Feel that energy. Yes.

1420
01:06:43,467 --> 01:06:46,468
Through your chest.
Your peacock chest. Yes.

1421
01:06:47,973 --> 01:06:50,973
Good! You like that? Yes. Good job.

1422
01:06:52,711 --> 01:06:55,711
Encouragement. Yes. Great job.

1423
01:06:57,215 --> 01:06:59,718
There, you need to find
your mental equilibrity.

1424
01:06:59,719 --> 01:07:00,986
Not on my knees, man, that hurts.

1425
01:07:00,987 --> 01:07:02,320
It's okay, it's okay.

1426
01:07:02,321 --> 01:07:03,989
Know your limits, yes?

1427
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:06,990
There is no giving up in yoga,
you know? Encouragement, yes!

1428
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:10,129
Encouragement my ass,
Daddy! You ain't even trying!

1429
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:12,265
Look, yoga's not my strong suit.

1430
01:07:12,266 --> 01:07:14,667
Yoga's not your strong suit?

1431
01:07:14,668 --> 01:07:16,836
Oh, look at this one. This
little one is flexible.

1432
01:07:16,837 --> 01:07:18,171
She's good. She's really good.

1433
01:07:18,172 --> 01:07:20,006
Ooh, fantastic.

1434
01:07:20,007 --> 01:07:21,175
So you do like the lizard.

1435
01:07:21,176 --> 01:07:23,911
Now is when we transfer
the energy, you see?

1436
01:07:23,912 --> 01:07:25,913
Yep. And you just lay
everything on top of her?

1437
01:07:25,914 --> 01:07:28,914
Yes. Lay it on. Stretch.

1438
01:07:28,917 --> 01:07:31,917
That feels pretty good, hon?

1439
01:07:33,255 --> 01:07:34,355
What?

1440
01:07:35,491 --> 01:07:38,491
Am I straight enough here, do you
think? Or am I curving a little?

1441
01:07:38,794 --> 01:07:40,161
Let me show you.

1442
01:07:40,162 --> 01:07:41,696
You feel the transfer of the energy.

1443
01:07:41,697 --> 01:07:42,797
Well, it feels solid.

1444
01:07:42,798 --> 01:07:44,599
It is tantric energy. Yeah.

1445
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,601
It is karma. Yes.

1446
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:50,938
Okay, now I want all my girls
in a downward dog position.

1447
01:07:51,541 --> 01:07:54,541
Yes, this pose contains
a tantric hip thrust.

1448
01:07:55,212 --> 01:07:56,378
Now you and I will try this.

1449
01:07:56,379 --> 01:07:58,815
You got a pose called "Yoga
Guy Gets His Ass Kicked',?

1450
01:07:58,816 --> 01:08:00,050
"Cause that's my favorite one.

1451
01:08:01,152 --> 01:08:03,220
I feel your anger, yes!

1452
01:08:03,221 --> 01:08:06,221
Yes, I got your blood pumping,
yes? No? Now use it! Harness it!

1453
01:08:08,794 --> 01:08:10,061
Hmm. Boom!

1454
01:08:10,062 --> 01:08:13,062
Everybody into the children's pose!

1455
01:08:13,065 --> 01:08:14,332
Heads down. Okay.

1456
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:16,567
Close your eyes. Yes?

1457
01:08:16,568 --> 01:08:18,970
Yes, good. Let's breathe.

1458
01:08:18,971 --> 01:08:21,972
Excuse me, Salvadore? I feel
like my sacrum is really tight.

1459
01:08:23,042 --> 01:08:24,743
Could you just help me
stretch it out a little?

1460
01:08:24,744 --> 01:08:27,412
Yes, of course, I will play
the role of your husband.

1461
01:08:27,413 --> 01:08:28,580
Great.

1462
01:08:28,581 --> 01:08:31,581
Boom, boom.

1463
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:36,320
Boom.

1464
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:41,158
The rain room has fire.
I did not see that coming.

1465
01:08:41,595 --> 01:08:44,498
I was getting centered.
I was enjoying the island.

1466
01:08:44,499 --> 01:08:46,200
What if Joey had seen?

1467
01:08:46,201 --> 01:08:47,835
Lucy, it was really inappropriate.

1468
01:08:47,836 --> 01:08:50,836
Well, I didn't know that you were
so concerned about how Joey felt.

1469
01:08:51,239 --> 01:08:52,740
What's that supposed to mean?

1470
01:08:52,741 --> 01:08:55,676
Let's drop it.

1471
01:08:55,677 --> 01:08:58,678
All I'm saying is that it
was pretty uncomfortable.

1472
01:08:59,715 --> 01:09:01,116
Well, then why were you staring?

1473
01:09:01,117 --> 01:09:03,018
It was hard to miss.

1474
01:09:03,019 --> 01:09:06,019
Trust me, Salvadore is
the least of our problems.

1475
01:09:08,458 --> 01:09:10,893
It's freezing in here. Why
would they make a room like this?

1476
01:09:10,894 --> 01:09:13,696
You should have seen my
masseuse. She was so hot.

1477
01:09:13,697 --> 01:09:15,298
You're supposed to be relaxing out here.

1478
01:09:15,299 --> 01:09:18,067
Why do you think I wanted
to get a full release?

1479
01:09:18,068 --> 01:09:19,937
You know what? I don't even
want to get into this with you.

1480
01:09:19,938 --> 01:09:21,038
Into what?

1481
01:09:21,039 --> 01:09:22,973
I don't want to get into
this conversation with you.

1482
01:09:22,974 --> 01:09:24,241
Why is that?

1483
01:09:24,242 --> 01:09:26,577
Because I don't want to be put in
a position where l,d have to lie.

1484
01:09:26,578 --> 01:09:28,045
Why are you getting all
high and mighty on me?

1485
01:09:28,046 --> 01:09:30,547
No, I'm not so high and mighty.
Joey, I'm not judging you,

1486
01:09:30,548 --> 01:09:31,983
I'm just not asking anything because

1487
01:09:31,984 --> 01:09:33,785
I don't want... I don't want to know.

1488
01:09:33,786 --> 01:09:35,320
Because that way, if someone asks me...

1489
01:09:35,321 --> 01:09:36,821
You won't have to rat me out.

1490
01:09:36,822 --> 01:09:38,957
I would never rat you out. Of
course I wouldn't't rat you out.

1491
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:40,158
Right, right. But this
way, I don't have to

1492
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:41,659
make that decision because
I really don't know.

1493
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:43,328
All right, let me ask
you something, then.

1494
01:09:43,329 --> 01:09:46,231
Could you honestly say that
after seven years together,

1495
01:09:46,232 --> 01:09:48,100
that you get turned
on by the same woman?

1496
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:49,234
I do.

1497
01:09:49,235 --> 01:09:50,769
Without going to the highlight reel.

1498
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:52,171
You're playing a verbal shell game.

1499
01:09:52,172 --> 01:09:53,505
l... You have to make
your own decisions.

1500
01:09:53,506 --> 01:09:54,640
I'm just saying I don't want to know.

1501
01:09:54,641 --> 01:09:56,242
I'm saying, if you're...
When you're sleeping with her,

1502
01:09:56,243 --> 01:09:57,744
if you're hitting up some fan favorites,

1503
01:09:57,745 --> 01:09:59,179
I think you're cheating on some level.

1504
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:00,847
You might not be acting on
it, but you're fantasizing.

1505
01:10:00,848 --> 01:10:02,415
You know what? I don't
know what journey you're on,

1506
01:10:02,416 --> 01:10:04,618
but l... I can't take
this trip with you.

1507
01:10:04,619 --> 01:10:06,286
But if I told you, as a friend...

1508
01:10:06,287 --> 01:10:09,288
I came up to you, I said, "Hey,
Dave, I'm attracted to men."

1509
01:10:10,692 --> 01:10:13,194
I was thinking about their bodies
and things, but I didn't act on it

1510
01:10:13,195 --> 01:10:16,195
because I'm straight and
I was being very strong,

1511
01:10:16,298 --> 01:10:18,432
would you consider me straight or gay?

1512
01:10:18,433 --> 01:10:20,836
If I desired a man.

1513
01:10:20,837 --> 01:10:22,871
If I was thinking about a man's body,

1514
01:10:22,872 --> 01:10:25,872
like how the light reflects
off of his sweaty back...

1515
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:29,511
Am I interrupting something? No.

1516
01:10:29,512 --> 01:10:30,980
We're great. Have a
seat. Want to sit down?

1517
01:10:30,981 --> 01:10:32,148
Enjoy this. Enjoy it.

1518
01:10:32,149 --> 01:10:33,383
No, I'm good here. Thank you.

1519
01:10:33,384 --> 01:10:35,718
If I was sleeping with my wife

1520
01:10:35,719 --> 01:10:37,720
and thinking about, like,
a dude's wet mouth...

1521
01:10:37,721 --> 01:10:40,721
Snow and steam, huh? Is
this place outstanding?

1522
01:10:41,392 --> 01:10:42,893
Okay, Jason, let me
ask you a question here.

1523
01:10:42,894 --> 01:10:44,561
Is the highlight reel
considered cheating?

1524
01:10:44,562 --> 01:10:46,163
The highlight reel? No.

1525
01:10:46,164 --> 01:10:48,032
I'm just saying everybody
cheats and everybody lies,

1526
01:10:48,033 --> 01:10:51,033
and whether they act upon it or
not is a secondary conversation.

1527
01:10:51,736 --> 01:10:52,903
So you're saying that you can't tell

1528
01:10:52,904 --> 01:10:54,806
the difference between
the highlight reel...

1529
01:10:54,807 --> 01:10:56,141
I can tell the difference.

1530
01:10:56,142 --> 01:10:57,375
...and physically, really
cheating on somebody?

1531
01:10:57,376 --> 01:10:58,743
Don't say it to me like I
can't tell the difference.

1532
01:10:58,744 --> 01:10:59,844
Well, that's what you're saying!

1533
01:10:59,845 --> 01:11:01,012
You're saying that they,re related,

1534
01:11:01,013 --> 01:11:02,180
then they're somehow in the same family.

1535
01:11:02,181 --> 01:11:04,215
No, no. I'm saying you own a Jack
Russell, I own a Bull Terrier.

1536
01:11:04,216 --> 01:11:05,984
They're both dogs.
They're both terriers.

1537
01:11:05,985 --> 01:11:07,386
Mine's just a little more
aggressive than yours.

1538
01:11:07,387 --> 01:11:08,587
I own a zebra, you own a goat.

1539
01:11:08,588 --> 01:11:10,356
What the hell's that have to
do with cheating on your wife?

1540
01:11:10,357 --> 01:11:11,891
Right, they're both animals.

1541
01:11:11,892 --> 01:11:14,892
Are you out of your mind? How
would you feel if your wife cheated?

1542
01:11:31,113 --> 01:11:34,113
Guys? Listen to me. Trudy's gone.

1543
01:11:35,584 --> 01:11:36,784
What? What do you mean?

1544
01:11:36,785 --> 01:11:37,952
What? I went to the room

1545
01:11:37,953 --> 01:11:39,287
and all her stuff was gone.

1546
01:11:39,288 --> 01:11:41,355
Where do... Where do you
think she went? Like she...

1547
01:11:41,356 --> 01:11:43,025
I don't know. We had
a argument at therapy.

1548
01:11:43,026 --> 01:11:45,928
She said she was sick of
my senior citizen bullshit.

1549
01:11:45,929 --> 01:11:48,297
I've been trying to keep up
with her, but I'm a old ass!

1550
01:11:48,298 --> 01:11:50,532
Shane, honey, it's not your fault.

1551
01:11:50,533 --> 01:11:53,469
No, it's bullshit. It is my
fault. I should have worked harder.

1552
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:54,637
Now she's gone!

1553
01:11:54,638 --> 01:11:57,638
She's not gone. I know where she is.

1554
01:11:59,643 --> 01:12:02,643
Sit down.

1555
01:12:02,913 --> 01:12:04,581
How do you know where she is?

1556
01:12:04,582 --> 01:12:06,450
Now use your head.

1557
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:09,451
She's a young girl. She wants
to party. She wants to get wild.

1558
01:12:10,622 --> 01:12:12,890
Too late to leave the
island. Where is she?

1559
01:12:12,891 --> 01:12:15,493
Where's the only place she could go?

1560
01:12:15,494 --> 01:12:18,495
Eden East, the singles' side.

1561
01:12:19,165 --> 01:12:20,298
We gotta go get her.

1562
01:12:20,299 --> 01:12:21,967
You're damn right we do!
And I'm going with you!

1563
01:12:21,968 --> 01:12:23,435
I am not letting you go alone!

1564
01:12:23,436 --> 01:12:26,436
I don't care if I have
to go there all night!

1565
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:30,341
To find Trudy. We're gonna
go find Trudy for him!

1566
01:12:31,445 --> 01:12:33,846
We can't even go to
that side, all right?

1567
01:12:33,847 --> 01:12:36,847
And it's gonna get very dark, very
soon. Plus we have to be in bed...

1568
01:12:37,351 --> 01:12:38,785
What are you talking about?

1569
01:12:38,786 --> 01:12:40,186
Listen to me.

1570
01:12:40,187 --> 01:12:42,356
We have to be to bed at a
very reasonable hour tonight

1571
01:12:42,357 --> 01:12:44,358
because we cannot miss
the sunrise in the morning.

1572
01:12:44,359 --> 01:12:46,693
Now, Marcel said if
we miss that sunrise,

1573
01:12:46,694 --> 01:12:48,595
we will not be completing our course.

1574
01:12:48,596 --> 01:12:50,798
We are here for the course, all right?
- Yes.

1575
01:12:50,799 --> 01:12:52,533
And stop eating and drinking, as well.

1576
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:55,535
Honey, our friend is
asking for our help.

1577
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:57,872
She's 20 years old, for God's sake.

1578
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:59,874
She's probably with a bunch
of dudes, like, sweating,

1579
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:02,875
drinking and dancing it out of
her system. What's the problem?

1580
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:05,214
Let her spend the night on Hump Island!

1581
01:13:05,215 --> 01:13:08,215
I promise, she's gonna come back
here first thing in the morning!

1582
01:13:08,318 --> 01:13:09,518
Dave, firstly...

1583
01:13:09,519 --> 01:13:12,519
I don't want her to spend
a night on Hump Island.

1584
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:14,190
No, I... I'm just trying to say

1585
01:13:14,191 --> 01:13:16,058
it's not like she's
kidnapped or something.

1586
01:13:16,059 --> 01:13:18,862
Now she's dead, Dave? Huh?

1587
01:13:18,863 --> 01:13:20,664
Now she's dead? She's
dead, now? She's not dead.

1588
01:13:20,665 --> 01:13:22,732
She's dead on Hump Island!

1589
01:13:22,733 --> 01:13:24,401
I'm just trying to put
it in perspective for you!

1590
01:13:24,402 --> 01:13:26,570
You know what? I don't even
know why I'm blowing up at you,

1591
01:13:26,571 --> 01:13:28,805
because it... It's...
Once again, it's my fault.

1592
01:13:28,806 --> 01:13:31,576
This is a Shane thing. I've been
dealing with this all my life.

1593
01:13:31,577 --> 01:13:34,577
First Jennifer, and now Trudy.

1594
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:37,715
We're gonna find her,
okay? I got a plan.

1595
01:13:37,716 --> 01:13:38,916
I know how to get there.

1596
01:13:38,917 --> 01:13:40,084
You do?

1597
01:13:40,085 --> 01:13:42,087
Yeah, I do.

1598
01:13:42,088 --> 01:13:45,088
I just can't tell you now "cause
we got Mr. Belvedere clocking us.

1599
01:13:46,993 --> 01:13:49,595
Now everybody take it real casual.

1600
01:13:49,596 --> 01:13:52,264
Just drink your drinks and smile.

1601
01:13:52,265 --> 01:13:53,933
So we just make it all nice.

1602
01:13:53,934 --> 01:13:56,502
Everything's easy, fun,
we're drinking, we're smiling.

1603
01:13:56,503 --> 01:13:58,104
Okay? We can't leave till sundown.

1604
01:13:58,105 --> 01:14:01,105
Guys, we all need to be together
first thing in the morning, okay?

1605
01:14:01,609 --> 01:14:03,743
Which is exactly why
we have to find Trudy.

1606
01:14:03,744 --> 01:14:06,745
Otherwise, we won't all be there.

1607
01:14:06,748 --> 01:14:09,748
Let's get out of here now. Reconvene
later at the beach, at 1900 hours.

1608
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:13,719
You with me?

1609
01:14:15,123 --> 01:14:18,124
Joey, we are not gonna be able to
finish the program if we get caught!

1610
01:14:18,928 --> 01:14:21,928
All right, bring it in.

1611
01:14:22,431 --> 01:14:25,431
Hey, come on, Shane!

1612
01:14:25,635 --> 01:14:28,103
We walk to the other
side, we get caught.

1613
01:14:28,104 --> 01:14:30,106
This way, we canoe out nice and easy,

1614
01:14:30,107 --> 01:14:32,041
we find ourselves a nice, quiet beach.

1615
01:14:32,042 --> 01:14:33,976
We pull up. We find the singles' side,

1616
01:14:33,977 --> 01:14:36,145
we find a dance floor,
we find some cocktails.

1617
01:14:36,146 --> 01:14:37,980
And we find Trudy and
we bring her back...

1618
01:14:37,981 --> 01:14:40,384
Yeah, we find Trudy and we
bring her right back here.

1619
01:14:40,385 --> 01:14:41,818
This is crazy.

1620
01:14:41,819 --> 01:14:44,154
Trust me. I was an Eagle Scout.

1621
01:14:44,155 --> 01:14:46,990
My mind is a compass. I
can handle these situations.

1622
01:14:46,991 --> 01:14:49,393
I've been trained to do so.

1623
01:14:49,394 --> 01:14:51,161
Now follow me and I'm
gonna get you there,

1624
01:14:51,162 --> 01:14:53,498
but we gotta do it quick
and we gotta do it quiet.

1625
01:14:53,499 --> 01:14:55,633
Come on.

1626
01:14:55,634 --> 01:14:57,602
These are not the best laid plans, okay?

1627
01:14:57,603 --> 01:14:59,637
I'm just gonna go on
record right now, okay?

1628
01:14:59,638 --> 01:15:02,638
I do not think this has a high chance...

1629
01:15:08,181 --> 01:15:11,181
If we keep up this pace,
we'll be there in 20 minutes!

1630
01:15:11,418 --> 01:15:14,418
I hope so!

1631
01:15:17,291 --> 01:15:20,291
What was that?

1632
01:15:20,628 --> 01:15:22,028
Great! Awesome!

1633
01:15:22,029 --> 01:15:23,363
What do we do?

1634
01:15:23,364 --> 01:15:25,098
No!

1635
01:15:25,099 --> 01:15:28,100
Jason! Cynthia!

1636
01:15:28,937 --> 01:15:30,204
Cynthia!

1637
01:15:30,205 --> 01:15:33,205
Grab the oar!

1638
01:15:36,144 --> 01:15:38,512
Are you okay?

1639
01:15:38,513 --> 01:15:39,948
You all right?

1640
01:15:39,949 --> 01:15:41,049
Yeah.

1641
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:44,050
We gotta go to shore!

1642
01:15:48,324 --> 01:15:50,058
Cynthia, we're out of synch again.

1643
01:15:50,059 --> 01:15:52,562
You know, you gotta paddle on
the opposite side of the boat!

1644
01:15:52,563 --> 01:15:55,298
Well, Jason, I can't see
which side you're paddling on!

1645
01:15:55,299 --> 01:15:56,966
Well, turn around and take
a look every once in a while.

1646
01:15:56,967 --> 01:15:59,736
Otherwise, we are gonna capsize
again. You get that, right?

1647
01:15:59,737 --> 01:16:01,137
It was an accident.

1648
01:16:01,138 --> 01:16:03,206
I'll bet it could have been avoided.

1649
01:16:03,207 --> 01:16:06,208
Right? Am I right? Baby'
I need you to paddle.

1650
01:16:06,644 --> 01:16:08,212
Cynthia, paddle the boat, please!

1651
01:16:08,213 --> 01:16:09,313
You know what?

1652
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:11,382
Sit down. You've got
to sit down in the boat!

1653
01:16:11,383 --> 01:16:14,383
Cynthia! Cynthia!

1654
01:16:14,886 --> 01:16:15,987
Cynthia!

1655
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:17,255
What are you doing?

1656
01:16:17,256 --> 01:16:20,256
Cynthia! Cynthia! Hey! Cynthia!

1657
01:16:26,699 --> 01:16:28,934
Thank God. Thank God that is over!

1658
01:16:28,935 --> 01:16:30,736
I mean, who jumps out of the canoe?

1659
01:16:30,737 --> 01:16:32,271
You could have really
hurt yourself out there!

1660
01:16:32,272 --> 01:16:34,440
Put these on. Cynthia?
Jason, I have had it!

1661
01:16:34,441 --> 01:16:36,709
I can't do everything
exactly the way you want!

1662
01:16:36,710 --> 01:16:39,711
I can't control the ocean and
row the boat and stop the waves!

1663
01:16:40,014 --> 01:16:41,114
Calm down!

1664
01:16:41,115 --> 01:16:44,115
And I can't do anything about the
fact that I can't get pregnant!

1665
01:16:49,957 --> 01:16:52,427
This is nuts.

1666
01:16:52,428 --> 01:16:55,428
No, it's me.

1667
01:16:56,698 --> 01:16:59,467
And I just really need
some time right now.

1668
01:16:59,468 --> 01:17:02,468
Please stop following me, 'cause
I need to be away from you.

1669
01:17:02,739 --> 01:17:05,739
Come on. What are you doing? Hey,
hey, where you going? That's a jungle!

1670
01:17:07,777 --> 01:17:09,812
You know what? I'm gonna
go check on her, okay?

1671
01:17:09,813 --> 01:17:11,313
Great, thank you.

1672
01:17:11,314 --> 01:17:12,781
Yeah, you guys go ahead.

1673
01:17:12,782 --> 01:17:14,283
I'm gonna make sure she's okay.

1674
01:17:14,284 --> 01:17:15,652
Honey, I don't think it's a good idea

1675
01:17:15,653 --> 01:17:16,953
that everyone separates right now.

1676
01:17:16,954 --> 01:17:18,088
I really don't think we have a choice.

1677
01:17:18,089 --> 01:17:19,155
Let me just go talk to her.

1678
01:17:19,156 --> 01:17:21,391
No, Jason, she really
needs a minute, okay?

1679
01:17:21,392 --> 01:17:22,926
All right, go ahead. I gotta go.

1680
01:17:22,927 --> 01:17:24,894
Baby! You guys go ahead!

1681
01:17:24,895 --> 01:17:27,896
We'll meet you guys there!

1682
01:17:30,735 --> 01:17:33,237
So, what are we gonna do about Trudy?

1683
01:17:33,238 --> 01:17:34,572
What are we gonna do about Cynthia,

1684
01:17:34,573 --> 01:17:36,407
who just disappeared into the jungle?

1685
01:17:36,408 --> 01:17:39,409
Jason, she's upset. Let her cool
down. You'll talk to her later.

1686
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:43,515
We still gotta get Trudy to do all
the Marcel stuff, anyway, all right?

1687
01:17:43,516 --> 01:17:46,516
So let's just get her ass
and let's get back home.

1688
01:17:47,019 --> 01:17:50,019
Cyn, please, slow down, honey.
I think we're almost there.

1689
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:53,958
I think we might have
taken a wrong turn.

1690
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:57,294
Really? Yeah.

1691
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:01,799
Wow.

1692
01:18:08,343 --> 01:18:11,343
Finally made it to the waterfall.

1693
01:18:15,217 --> 01:18:17,785
I think my marriage is over.

1694
01:18:17,786 --> 01:18:18,887
What?

1695
01:18:18,888 --> 01:18:21,222
Honey, don't say that.
You're just exhausted.

1696
01:18:21,223 --> 01:18:24,223
I am. I'm so tired of him trying
to steer everything in the direction

1697
01:18:27,063 --> 01:18:29,498
that he thinks is right all the time.

1698
01:18:29,499 --> 01:18:32,499
Listen. Don't make any
decisions right now.

1699
01:18:32,736 --> 01:18:34,236
You guys just need to take a breather.

1700
01:18:34,237 --> 01:18:36,138
Get a little bit of space, you know?

1701
01:18:36,139 --> 01:18:37,574
You'll be okay. You know?

1702
01:18:37,575 --> 01:18:40,310
You guys have been on top of
each other ever since we got here.

1703
01:18:40,311 --> 01:18:43,311
No, that's the... Actually, the
one thing that we haven't done.

1704
01:18:45,716 --> 01:18:48,716
We haven't had sex
since we've been here.

1705
01:18:50,088 --> 01:18:53,088
We've barely even touched each other.

1706
01:18:54,092 --> 01:18:55,993
Now, Cynthia and I
are in a terrible spot.

1707
01:18:55,994 --> 01:18:58,162
I come to this island, I come to
the program to get some answers,

1708
01:18:58,163 --> 01:18:59,397
find out my animal spirit... Yeah.

1709
01:18:59,398 --> 01:19:00,932
Let me help you out on the
whole animal spirit thing.

1710
01:19:00,933 --> 01:19:03,268
It's gonna be awesome! It always is.

1711
01:19:03,269 --> 01:19:05,771
It's like if you go to a tarot
card reader for past lives,

1712
01:19:05,772 --> 01:19:06,939
you're always something cool... Dave...

1713
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:08,440
...like a king or a gunfighter.

1714
01:19:08,441 --> 01:19:09,675
No one ever finds out that they were,

1715
01:19:09,676 --> 01:19:11,109
like, a shopkeeper or an asshole.

1716
01:19:11,110 --> 01:19:12,945
Is this hilarious to you?
'Cause it's not to me.

1717
01:19:12,946 --> 01:19:15,715
Tell you what+ If I get kicked off
this island, I'm gonna blame all of you.

1718
01:19:15,716 --> 01:19:18,084
And I can't believe I let
the two of you derail me!

1719
01:19:18,085 --> 01:19:19,619
We derailed you? That's correct.

1720
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:20,753
If you kept a closer eye on Trudy,

1721
01:19:20,754 --> 01:19:23,623
she wouldn't have strayed so
far from the pack, all right?

1722
01:19:23,624 --> 01:19:25,459
She's not a dog, Jason.
Yeah? Well, listen,

1723
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:27,461
she's been very selfish, hasn't
been a very good teammate.

1724
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:28,596
I can tell you that. No, no, no, no, no.

1725
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,431
Look, I made promises, I let her down.

1726
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:33,033
You don't know the ins and
outs of our relationship.

1727
01:19:33,034 --> 01:19:35,569
Is that what it is? It's a
relationship? It's been two weeks, okay?

1728
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:37,038
All right? That's not a relationship.

1729
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:38,740
It's more like an
antibiotic cycle, all right?

1730
01:19:38,741 --> 01:19:40,475
She should be very happy
that she's even here.

1731
01:19:40,476 --> 01:19:41,910
You're a good guy. You
brought her to this island.

1732
01:19:41,911 --> 01:19:42,978
She shouldn't be running off.

1733
01:19:42,979 --> 01:19:44,045
She should be doing
everything that she can,

1734
01:19:44,046 --> 01:19:45,647
bending over backwards
to make you happy.

1735
01:19:45,648 --> 01:19:47,983
Don't blame this on Shane.
You brought this on yourself.

1736
01:19:47,984 --> 01:19:49,318
I don't need to hear it from you, okay?

1737
01:19:49,319 --> 01:19:50,653
It's half your fault. Half his fault,

1738
01:19:50,654 --> 01:19:52,154
half Trudy's fault, half your fault.

1739
01:19:52,155 --> 01:19:54,156
Me? Yeah, with the whole canoe scheme?

1740
01:19:54,157 --> 01:19:57,157
All right? You put me and my
wife in a very extreme situation,

1741
01:19:57,294 --> 01:19:58,661
put tension on the relationship.

1742
01:19:58,662 --> 01:20:00,831
Your wife left you because
you were suffocating her.

1743
01:20:00,832 --> 01:20:02,299
And now you're suffocating me!

1744
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:03,900
And you're suffocating Shane, too!

1745
01:20:03,901 --> 01:20:06,901
Yeah, don't suffocate me, man.

1746
01:20:07,138 --> 01:20:10,138
A grown woman literally jumped
into shark-infested waters

1747
01:20:10,475 --> 01:20:12,977
and did a distance swim that
she had no way to train for

1748
01:20:12,978 --> 01:20:15,947
instead of staying in
a dry canoe with you.

1749
01:20:15,948 --> 01:20:17,515
Look in the mirror.

1750
01:20:17,516 --> 01:20:20,018
Okay, Joseph Cecil Tanzini,

1751
01:20:20,019 --> 01:20:23,019
with a monsoon of respect, I
don't think you're in a position

1752
01:20:23,022 --> 01:20:24,590
to be telling anyone
to look in the mirror

1753
01:20:24,591 --> 01:20:26,091
when it comes to relationships.

1754
01:20:26,092 --> 01:20:28,661
You're not Mr. "'I Try So
Hard At My Relationship," okay?

1755
01:20:28,662 --> 01:20:30,362
So let's go, glass house.

1756
01:20:30,363 --> 01:20:32,031
Me, glass house?

1757
01:20:32,032 --> 01:20:34,700
You, glass house!
You're the glass house!

1758
01:20:34,701 --> 01:20:36,303
Talk to me about relationships.

1759
01:20:36,304 --> 01:20:37,837
You got a woman who adores you.

1760
01:20:37,838 --> 01:20:39,172
She'd do anything for you.

1761
01:20:39,173 --> 01:20:40,807
You have a real partner in life,

1762
01:20:40,808 --> 01:20:42,375
and what does she want from you?

1763
01:20:42,376 --> 01:20:45,376
"Take me to the waterfall."
But, no, you can't take her

1764
01:20:45,813 --> 01:20:48,814
because you had some over-stimulated
snorkeling experience.

1765
01:20:49,017 --> 01:20:50,451
Do you think when your marriage is over

1766
01:20:50,452 --> 01:20:51,886
that you're gonna find somebody

1767
01:20:51,887 --> 01:20:53,287
that just caters to you, no matter what?

1768
01:20:53,288 --> 01:20:54,555
That you're not gonna
have to work at it?

1769
01:20:54,556 --> 01:20:57,325
That's gonna be, like, psyched to go to
Applebee's with you every Friday night

1770
01:20:57,326 --> 01:20:58,559
and hear the same football stories

1771
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,062
about how you rocked in high school?

1772
01:21:00,063 --> 01:21:02,964
I did rock in high school
football. You want to check tape?

1773
01:21:02,965 --> 01:21:05,233
But whoever that person is, you
have to listen to their stories, too,

1774
01:21:05,234 --> 01:21:07,302
or they're not gonna go
to Applebee's with you.

1775
01:21:07,303 --> 01:21:09,504
You're not gonna have someone
to go to Applebee's with.

1776
01:21:09,505 --> 01:21:12,506
You'll be sitting by yourself,
eventually, at Applebee's, all alone.

1777
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:16,510
And who wants to go to
Applebee's by themselves?

1778
01:21:17,214 --> 01:21:18,715
You know what? If anyone
should be mad here, guys,

1779
01:21:18,716 --> 01:21:19,982
it should be me.

1780
01:21:19,983 --> 01:21:22,983
I am having a real fight with my
wife, okay? And it's not a fun feeling.

1781
01:21:24,222 --> 01:21:26,423
Look it. I'm talking in
circles. I'm on an island.

1782
01:21:26,424 --> 01:21:28,325
I'm getting island fever now.
I'm starting to lose my mind.

1783
01:21:28,326 --> 01:21:30,361
This is an early sign of things to come.

1784
01:21:30,362 --> 01:21:33,362
And what we need to do now is get
focused and stop pointing fingers.

1785
01:21:33,431 --> 01:21:36,432
You're a problem. You're
a real, real problem.

1786
01:21:41,207 --> 01:21:43,742
Is that Salvadore?

1787
01:21:43,743 --> 01:21:46,743
Does this guy think he's a
mermaid? What is his deal?

1788
01:21:48,949 --> 01:21:51,917
Oh. Please, excuse my nudity.

1789
01:21:51,918 --> 01:21:54,918
I was expecting no company.

1790
01:21:54,955 --> 01:21:57,955
Allow me to put something on.

1791
01:21:58,925 --> 01:22:00,193
I would have asked you to join me,

1792
01:22:00,194 --> 01:22:03,194
but the water is a little chilly.

1793
01:22:04,599 --> 01:22:07,567
But perhaps this will
warm up the evening.

1794
01:22:07,568 --> 01:22:09,136
And what is that?

1795
01:22:09,137 --> 01:22:12,138
It's an island rum, infused with
the essence of the coconut fruit.

1796
01:22:13,776 --> 01:22:15,309
Delicious.

1797
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:17,478
Yes? You like? Very much.

1798
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:18,946
Yes.

1799
01:22:18,947 --> 01:22:20,381
That's yummy.

1800
01:22:20,382 --> 01:22:21,582
It is yummy.

1801
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:22,950
It's yummy, yummy, yummy, isn't it?

1802
01:22:22,951 --> 01:22:24,453
Mmm. Yes.

1803
01:22:24,454 --> 01:22:25,554
Oh, oh...

1804
01:22:25,555 --> 01:22:27,756
Slow down there, killer.

1805
01:22:27,757 --> 01:22:30,757
You see, this island has
so many healing curiosities.

1806
01:22:31,494 --> 01:22:34,494
You know, it is good to have
a drink and have a good time.

1807
01:22:36,233 --> 01:22:39,233
Then do it!

1808
01:22:43,641 --> 01:22:45,241
Well, I guess we just go around, huh?

1809
01:22:45,242 --> 01:22:47,011
No, we gotta go through. The path ends.

1810
01:22:47,012 --> 01:22:48,779
We go off the path,
we get lost+ Come on.

1811
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:50,147
No, hey, we'll make a new path.

1812
01:22:50,148 --> 01:22:52,817
What if there's people in there? Joey!

1813
01:22:54,753 --> 01:22:56,253
Be careful, sweetie.

1814
01:22:56,254 --> 01:22:59,255
Ronnie, I'm Cynthia. I'm always careful!

1815
01:23:00,026 --> 01:23:01,326
Yes!

1816
01:23:01,327 --> 01:23:04,327
Okay.

1817
01:23:05,198 --> 01:23:06,331
Okay.

1818
01:23:06,332 --> 01:23:09,332
Get in there. You,re
leaving fingerprints!

1819
01:23:09,669 --> 01:23:12,171
I don't know what you're doing...

1820
01:23:12,172 --> 01:23:14,640
Get away from the door.

1821
01:23:14,641 --> 01:23:17,276
Jessie is a friend

1822
01:23:17,277 --> 01:23:20,277
Yeah, I know he's been
A good friend of mine

1823
01:23:20,881 --> 01:23:23,882
But lately something's changed
That ain't hard to define

1824
01:23:24,552 --> 01:23:27,552
Jessie's got himself a girl
And I want to make her mine

1825
01:23:28,389 --> 01:23:31,389
And she's watching him with those eyes

1826
01:23:31,726 --> 01:23:34,727
And she's loving him with
that body I just know it

1827
01:23:35,464 --> 01:23:38,464
And he's holding her in
his arms late Late at night

1828
01:23:40,002 --> 01:23:41,903
You know,..

1829
01:23:41,904 --> 01:23:44,739
Hey! What are you doing here?

1830
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:47,741
Private staff quarters are
strictly off limits to hotel guests!

1831
01:23:48,245 --> 01:23:51,245
I'm so sorry that we are disturbing
your fortress of solitude here.

1832
01:23:53,083 --> 01:23:56,083
I'm going to have to ask you to
leave The Ponderosa immediately.

1833
01:23:56,386 --> 01:23:58,989
Well, that's a shame, because
the place is so inviting.

1834
01:23:58,990 --> 01:24:00,991
When does Hoss and Little Joe show up?

1835
01:24:00,992 --> 01:24:02,325
Dave.

1836
01:24:02,326 --> 01:24:05,326
You gentlemen have
broken into The Ponderosa

1837
01:24:05,596 --> 01:24:08,098
and have broken the
rules of this island.

1838
01:24:08,099 --> 01:24:11,100
And, unfortunately, I don't think
you're gonna like the consequences.

1839
01:24:13,772 --> 01:24:15,606
I'm gonna call monsieur Marcel.

1840
01:24:15,607 --> 01:24:17,008
No, no, no, no, no, no. Sctanley,

1841
01:24:17,009 --> 01:24:18,342
there's been a big misunderstanding.

1842
01:24:18,343 --> 01:24:20,244
Some of us don't
necessarily want to be here.

1843
01:24:20,245 --> 01:24:22,948
I'm sorry, Mr. Smith, but
you've broken the rules

1844
01:24:22,949 --> 01:24:24,716
and there are consequences.

1845
01:24:24,717 --> 01:24:27,717
Yes, could you get
Marcel for me, please?

1846
01:24:27,854 --> 01:24:30,854
Yes, I know he's asleep, but wake
him. This is important. I'll hold.

1847
01:24:32,191 --> 01:24:33,860
What a shocker that
this went bad. Thank you.

1848
01:24:33,861 --> 01:24:35,962
Came here for answers and
now I'm not gonna get them!

1849
01:24:35,963 --> 01:24:37,263
Great.

1850
01:24:37,264 --> 01:24:39,198
Great leading, Joey. Me?

1851
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,400
Yeah, you.

1852
01:24:40,401 --> 01:24:43,401
I thought monsieur Marcel felt
that technology was a distraction.

1853
01:24:44,305 --> 01:24:45,806
For the guests, yeah.

1854
01:24:45,807 --> 01:24:47,207
You seem pretty good at that game.

1855
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:49,243
He's the best on the whole island.

1856
01:24:49,244 --> 01:24:51,946
It's a pretty small island.

1857
01:24:51,947 --> 01:24:54,947
Doesn't look like it's all that hard.

1858
01:24:57,753 --> 01:25:00,155
Looks like all you gotta
do is push these big buttons

1859
01:25:00,156 --> 01:25:03,156
and play along with the
song here. Am I right?

1860
01:25:03,659 --> 01:25:06,659
Something like that.

1861
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:12,800
You know what'd be a gas,
Sctanley? For me and you to play.

1862
01:25:13,303 --> 01:25:14,804
And when I win,

1863
01:25:14,805 --> 01:25:17,805
you could point me towards the singles'
side and forget you ever saw us.

1864
01:25:19,476 --> 01:25:22,477
When you beat me?

1865
01:25:31,689 --> 01:25:34,690
When I win, what will you give me?

1866
01:25:35,594 --> 01:25:38,594
Maybe just this.

1867
01:25:39,331 --> 01:25:42,331
$1,000
- A cool G, as we call it back home.

1868
01:25:42,601 --> 01:25:44,669
Are you at liberty to
play for that, Sctanley?

1869
01:25:44,670 --> 01:25:47,671
Or would you prefer to play for smiles?

1870
01:25:49,509 --> 01:25:52,509
Monsieur Marcel, I'm
sorry to have woken you.

1871
01:25:52,712 --> 01:25:55,447
I thought there was an
emergency, but I was mistaken.

1872
01:25:55,448 --> 01:25:57,717
I do apologize.

1873
01:26:03,457 --> 01:26:06,457
I play at expert level.

1874
01:26:10,632 --> 01:26:13,632
You take this kind of serious.

1875
01:26:16,071 --> 01:26:19,071
That's a big screen.

1876
01:26:30,253 --> 01:26:31,753
You've played this before.

1877
01:26:31,754 --> 01:26:34,755
Maybe just a couple times, Sctanley.

1878
01:26:35,392 --> 01:26:38,392
All right, Sctanley,
let's have some fun.

1879
01:26:48,273 --> 01:26:49,907
Come on, Sctanley, get him!

1880
01:26:49,908 --> 01:26:51,108
Don't let him get in your head.

1881
01:26:51,109 --> 01:26:54,109
Don't let him get in your head, Dave.

1882
01:27:05,424 --> 01:27:07,258
I know a place you will like.

1883
01:27:07,259 --> 01:27:10,129
Really? Yes. You will love it.

1884
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:13,032
What kind of place?

1885
01:27:13,033 --> 01:27:14,633
Like a place that has dancing?

1886
01:27:14,634 --> 01:27:16,435
There is everything. Everything?

1887
01:27:16,436 --> 01:27:18,137
Oh, my God, you guys,
I want to go dancing!

1888
01:27:18,138 --> 01:27:20,140
You want to go? Yes, please, regard me.

1889
01:27:20,141 --> 01:27:22,075
Follow me. Oh, my God,
yeah, I want to go!

1890
01:27:22,076 --> 01:27:23,477
It'll be a girls' night!

1891
01:27:23,478 --> 01:27:24,611
Okay, but, honey, honey,
honey... Oh, my God.

1892
01:27:24,612 --> 01:27:26,246
You should just slow down
here for a second maybe?

1893
01:27:26,247 --> 01:27:29,247
That's exactly what I need!

1894
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:59,280
It's the second guitar solo
that sorts the men from the boys.

1895
01:28:00,151 --> 01:28:02,519
I was kind of counting
on that, Sctan. Joey?

1896
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:03,653
Yeah?

1897
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:06,654
I think it's time to
show the donkey the snake.

1898
01:28:08,026 --> 01:28:10,294
Cut his head, cut his
head, cut his head!

1899
01:28:10,295 --> 01:28:11,929
Go, go, go!

1900
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:14,930
Dave! Dave! Cut his head!

1901
01:28:15,367 --> 01:28:18,367
Big finish.

1902
01:28:21,274 --> 01:28:24,274
Star power! Star power! Yes!

1903
01:28:25,111 --> 01:28:28,111
Sctanley, no!

1904
01:28:35,455 --> 01:28:38,455
Yeah!

1905
01:28:39,393 --> 01:28:40,560
You hustled me.

1906
01:28:40,561 --> 01:28:43,562
Yes, I did.

1907
01:28:43,965 --> 01:28:46,965
For that, I'm sorry. You see,
I sell video games, Sctanley.

1908
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:51,738
And this one here, in
particular, in fact.

1909
01:28:51,739 --> 01:28:54,141
And I'm proud to stand here before you

1910
01:28:54,142 --> 01:28:56,878
and tell you it brings
me as much happiness

1911
01:28:56,879 --> 01:28:59,547
as it does for the
people I provide them to.

1912
01:28:59,548 --> 01:29:02,548
And we had a bet, and I know
that you're a man of your word.

1913
01:29:06,088 --> 01:29:07,823
Forget that you saw me and my friends

1914
01:29:07,824 --> 01:29:10,824
and point me in the
direction that I seek.

1915
01:29:12,596 --> 01:29:15,596
I cannot confirm or deny that the one
that you seek is on the singles' side.

1916
01:29:18,068 --> 01:29:21,069
But a bet is a bet. And I
will tell you how to get there.

1917
01:29:23,407 --> 01:29:26,407
The beach is blocked by rocks.
It's completely impassable.

1918
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:29,611
No more boats for me and
my friends. I go by foot.

1919
01:29:30,114 --> 01:29:33,017
I would be remiss if I did not
advise you to wait until daylight.

1920
01:29:33,018 --> 01:29:34,585
Do not take this journey lightly.

1921
01:29:34,586 --> 01:29:35,920
Hmm.

1922
01:29:35,921 --> 01:29:37,889
There is an old game
path through the forest,

1923
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:40,124
just beyond the abandoned Starbucks.

1924
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:43,126
Take it to where it forks. Jog to
the right. Do not go to the left.

1925
01:29:46,132 --> 01:29:49,132
You will see lights. You
don't want to go there.

1926
01:29:52,705 --> 01:29:53,972
Keep walking.

1927
01:29:53,973 --> 01:29:56,974
Look up and locate the
belt of Orion the Hunter.

1928
01:29:57,578 --> 01:29:59,078
I think we should be writing this down.

1929
01:29:59,079 --> 01:30:00,480
I think Dave's got it.

1930
01:30:00,481 --> 01:30:02,582
The stars shall be your guide.

1931
01:30:02,583 --> 01:30:05,418
As long as we're headed east, that's
the direction we're supposed to be going.

1932
01:30:05,419 --> 01:30:06,654
I'm looking for the Little Dipper.

1933
01:30:06,655 --> 01:30:08,656
If I could find the Little Dipper,
I could find the North Star.

1934
01:30:08,657 --> 01:30:09,990
Shane, help me find the Little Dipper.

1935
01:30:09,991 --> 01:30:11,458
What do I look like, Harriet Tubman?

1936
01:30:11,459 --> 01:30:13,060
Fine! I'll do it by myself, okay?

1937
01:30:13,061 --> 01:30:15,429
You guys are no help! Just... Just...

1938
01:30:18,834 --> 01:30:20,001
Welcome to Hump Island!

1939
01:30:20,002 --> 01:30:23,002
It's time to feast here in the
belly of the beast here at Eden East!

1940
01:30:24,507 --> 01:30:26,942
Now can you feel it? Come on!

1941
01:30:26,943 --> 01:30:29,344
Man, we are about to get
this party started right!

1942
01:30:29,345 --> 01:30:31,080
You guys ready?

1943
01:30:34,017 --> 01:30:35,351
Bingo!

1944
01:30:35,352 --> 01:30:36,852
Hey, yo, check it out, y'all!

1945
01:30:36,853 --> 01:30:39,422
A luau fire and drum show
is coming up real soon!

1946
01:30:39,423 --> 01:30:41,157
Some of the best drummers
in the whole world.

1947
01:30:41,158 --> 01:30:42,526
Don't forget to check it out!

1948
01:30:42,527 --> 01:30:44,127
This place is out of control.

1949
01:30:44,128 --> 01:30:46,096
What could she be possibly
getting into over here, man?

1950
01:30:46,097 --> 01:30:47,698
Come on, let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

1951
01:30:47,699 --> 01:30:48,865
For all we know, she could be sitting

1952
01:30:48,866 --> 01:30:50,300
in a corner sulking somewhere.

1953
01:30:50,301 --> 01:30:53,301
Hey, we can do this. We get in, we
get out, we're back before sunrise.

1954
01:30:53,539 --> 01:30:56,539
I know... I know that girl. San Diego!

1955
01:30:57,710 --> 01:30:59,377
I know that girl. I'm gonna go see

1956
01:30:59,378 --> 01:31:00,678
if I can get some answers out of her.

1957
01:31:00,679 --> 01:31:02,547
What are you talking about?
I'm trying to find Trudy!

1958
01:31:02,548 --> 01:31:04,515
Talking to locals is the
best way to get information!

1959
01:31:04,516 --> 01:31:05,718
You guys should be doing it, too.

1960
01:31:05,719 --> 01:31:06,852
That's a great idea. We split up.

1961
01:31:06,853 --> 01:31:08,354
That way, we find her twice
as fast. Shane, with me.

1962
01:31:08,355 --> 01:31:09,822
We shouldn't split up,
we should stay together.

1963
01:31:09,823 --> 01:31:11,390
Listen, Dave, time is
of the essence, okay,

1964
01:31:11,391 --> 01:31:13,158
and if we don't find
her, here's what else.

1965
01:31:13,159 --> 01:31:15,527
We meet back at the exit in,
like, an hour, okay? Come on.

1966
01:31:15,528 --> 01:31:16,895
Let's go. Jason, there's
a ton of people here.

1967
01:31:16,896 --> 01:31:18,732
If we split up, we're
gonna... Stay with Joey.

1968
01:31:18,733 --> 01:31:19,899
This place rocks.

1969
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:21,001
What are you doing?

1970
01:31:21,002 --> 01:31:22,402
What am I doing? I'm
trying to have a good time.

1971
01:31:22,403 --> 01:31:24,871
I'm trying to have a party going on. Hi.

1972
01:31:24,872 --> 01:31:26,473
Hi. Hi.

1973
01:31:26,474 --> 01:31:27,640
Hi.

1974
01:31:27,641 --> 01:31:29,176
We gotta find Trudy. I
don't want to get into this.

1975
01:31:29,177 --> 01:31:31,245
Come on, buddy.

1976
01:31:31,246 --> 01:31:33,247
What, are you dying to be
part of the new singles scene?

1977
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:35,149
Look at all these people.
They're running around, they're...

1978
01:31:35,150 --> 01:31:38,052
They're sexting, they're krumping,
they're twatting each other

1979
01:31:38,053 --> 01:31:40,321
'cause their day's so special they
have to share it with the world.

1980
01:31:40,322 --> 01:31:42,190
It's called tweeting.
I call it twatting!

1981
01:31:42,191 --> 01:31:43,925
Look, Joey, we were
single. We had our fun.

1982
01:31:43,926 --> 01:31:45,160
We're not missing out on anything.

1983
01:31:45,161 --> 01:31:46,762
No, you were single, you had fun.

1984
01:31:46,763 --> 01:31:49,097
I got married early, so I
never got to experience this.

1985
01:31:49,098 --> 01:31:51,867
I have a feeling you had a chance
to experience lots of things.

1986
01:31:51,868 --> 01:31:54,370
But, look, if you want to
go play "Guess Your Disease"

1987
01:31:54,371 --> 01:31:56,873
or "Let Me Translate Your Tribal
Tattoo," knock yourself out.

1988
01:31:56,874 --> 01:31:59,108
You don't get it. I'm here
trapped on an island with a woman

1989
01:31:59,109 --> 01:32:00,343
who can't even stand the sight of me.

1990
01:32:00,344 --> 01:32:02,111
And whose fault is
that? It's not my fault!

1991
01:32:02,112 --> 01:32:03,846
Dude, relationships
are a two-way street,

1992
01:32:03,847 --> 01:32:05,416
not a highway and a bike path.

1993
01:32:05,417 --> 01:32:07,017
If it matters to you, work at it.

1994
01:32:07,018 --> 01:32:08,585
And if it doesn't, then don't!

1995
01:32:08,586 --> 01:32:10,187
But make a decision.

1996
01:32:10,188 --> 01:32:11,622
I want to be married

1997
01:32:11,623 --> 01:32:14,623
'cause I want to have people
I can share my life with.

1998
01:32:16,394 --> 01:32:19,395
I don't wanna be doing
this. I know what I want.

1999
01:32:21,967 --> 01:32:24,967
I want it... Look. Hey, Dave, it's
not 'cause I don't want it, okay?

2000
01:32:26,138 --> 01:32:29,139
You make the best of your
situation! My situation's to party!

2001
01:32:31,111 --> 01:32:33,412
Yeah!

2002
01:32:33,413 --> 01:32:34,480
Yeah, definitely.

2003
01:32:34,481 --> 01:32:37,481
San Diego!

2004
01:32:37,584 --> 01:32:39,318
Remember me? Where have you been?

2005
01:32:39,319 --> 01:32:41,388
Where have I been? I've
been trying to get here!

2006
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:42,656
Look, we'll never be able to find her.

2007
01:32:42,657 --> 01:32:45,292
If... If I walk over there,
she's gonna walk over here.

2008
01:32:45,293 --> 01:32:47,094
If I'm on this side, she's
probably gonna be on that side!

2009
01:32:47,095 --> 01:32:49,796
All right, panicking's
not gonna help, Shane.

2010
01:32:49,797 --> 01:32:51,932
Hey, want to dance, tough guy?

2011
01:32:51,933 --> 01:32:54,635
No, I'd step on your feet, I'd
hurt you. Thank you, though.

2012
01:32:54,636 --> 01:32:57,636
All right, now, everybody up,
everybody up! This is Eden East!

2013
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:01,440
This place is amazing! I can't
believe they kept this from us!

2014
01:33:02,244 --> 01:33:03,344
I knew you would love it.

2015
01:33:03,345 --> 01:33:05,614
This is why I brought
you here. Vitality!

2016
01:33:05,615 --> 01:33:08,350
Oh, it is so nice to be
out with lots of people!

2017
01:33:08,351 --> 01:33:11,186
Everyone's smiling and laughing.
Don't you guys love this?

2018
01:33:11,187 --> 01:33:14,187
It's great. In a couple more
minutes, I'll just roofie myself.

2019
01:33:14,324 --> 01:33:17,026
I will go get my special
Salvadore drink, yes?

2020
01:33:17,027 --> 01:33:18,328
Oh, yes.

2021
01:33:18,329 --> 01:33:19,929
"Guess I am on my way."

2022
01:33:19,930 --> 01:33:21,498
"Mighty glad you stayed!"

2023
01:33:21,499 --> 01:33:24,499
Yes! Yes!

2024
01:33:25,436 --> 01:33:27,036
He is so much fun!

2025
01:33:27,037 --> 01:33:28,639
Oh, God, don't even start.

2026
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:30,207
I'm just having fun.

2027
01:33:30,208 --> 01:33:32,309
No, it's just... Guys, this is too much.

2028
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:33,944
What's too much? Let's
just get it together

2029
01:33:33,945 --> 01:33:36,945
and chill out a little.

2030
01:33:41,954 --> 01:33:44,954
Excuse me, I don't mean to
disturb you. My name's Dave.

2031
01:33:45,458 --> 01:33:46,725
Hi. Ronnie.

2032
01:33:46,726 --> 01:33:48,560
Ronnie. That's a great name.

2033
01:33:48,561 --> 01:33:49,961
Thank you. Yeah.

2034
01:33:49,962 --> 01:33:51,731
Do you have a cell phone I could use?

2035
01:33:51,732 --> 01:33:53,032
Why?

2036
01:33:53,033 --> 01:33:56,033
Someone's got to call God and let
him know one of his angels is missing.

2037
01:33:56,637 --> 01:33:59,539
Wow, that is the worst
line I've ever heard.

2038
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:00,673
Well, what do you want from me?

2039
01:34:00,674 --> 01:34:02,074
I've been out of the game for a while.

2040
01:34:02,075 --> 01:34:05,076
I've been slumming it
with a really hot redhead.

2041
01:34:05,346 --> 01:34:06,747
Now you're getting closer.

2042
01:34:06,748 --> 01:34:08,982
Dave, if you're here to be
an olive branch for Jason,

2043
01:34:08,983 --> 01:34:11,585
I am not gonna talk about it tonight.

2044
01:34:11,586 --> 01:34:12,920
I'm not here to talk about anything,

2045
01:34:12,921 --> 01:34:15,922
I just want to see my wife. Let's go.

2046
01:34:17,927 --> 01:34:19,994
I can't just leave these two.

2047
01:34:19,995 --> 01:34:22,995
I think they'll survive.

2048
01:34:24,833 --> 01:34:27,834
We sure will.

2049
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:32,675
They are so lucky.

2050
01:34:34,177 --> 01:34:37,177
Now this next jam goes out to
all you party people in the house!

2051
01:34:38,682 --> 01:34:41,683
Everybody, up! Let's keep
this party going, y'all!

2052
01:34:41,786 --> 01:34:43,186
Maybe we ought to wait by the exit,

2053
01:34:43,187 --> 01:34:44,788
so when people come out, you know...

2054
01:34:44,789 --> 01:34:45,922
Whatever we do, we gotta do it fast.

2055
01:34:45,923 --> 01:34:48,923
I gotta get back, gotta
find my wife, you know?

2056
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:52,061
What do you got? You see her?

2057
01:34:53,565 --> 01:34:56,565
That's my wife.

2058
01:34:56,635 --> 01:34:58,970
Jennifer?

2059
01:34:58,971 --> 01:35:01,971
Shane?

2060
01:35:03,042 --> 01:35:06,042
God, Shane, there you are! I've
been looking all over for you.

2061
01:35:07,447 --> 01:35:08,947
Jennifer, what are you doing here?

2062
01:35:08,948 --> 01:35:11,948
Look, I heard at the salon that you were
coming to this crazy singles' island,

2063
01:35:13,219 --> 01:35:16,220
so I just felt a strong sense of urgency

2064
01:35:16,590 --> 01:35:19,158
that you and l needed to
talk before it was too late.

2065
01:35:19,159 --> 01:35:20,893
Jennifer, you left me, remember?

2066
01:35:20,894 --> 01:35:23,329
I know, I know.

2067
01:35:23,330 --> 01:35:26,232
But then I was hoping that
you would come after me.

2068
01:35:26,233 --> 01:35:29,234
It wasn't like you walked out
of a bar! It was a divorce.

2069
01:35:29,471 --> 01:35:30,904
And why are you even at this place?

2070
01:35:30,905 --> 01:35:33,007
Do you know this place is insane?

2071
01:35:33,008 --> 01:35:34,575
I'm getting called names.

2072
01:35:34,576 --> 01:35:37,576
I've been called a cougar,
a black panther, a puma!

2073
01:35:38,013 --> 01:35:40,081
I had to smack this one kid.

2074
01:35:40,082 --> 01:35:43,082
That's the last time he'll walk
up to a woman talking about cougar!

2075
01:35:43,653 --> 01:35:44,753
Yeah.

2076
01:35:44,754 --> 01:35:46,454
I've been looking all
over the place for you.

2077
01:35:46,455 --> 01:35:47,689
And where have you been?

2078
01:35:47,690 --> 01:35:50,459
Well, actually, I'm
staying on the other side,

2079
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:53,162
the couples' side, with my girlfriend.

2080
01:35:53,163 --> 01:35:56,163
What? Who?

2081
01:35:56,433 --> 01:35:59,433
Her name is Trudy and she's
aspiring to be a manager.

2082
01:36:01,338 --> 01:36:03,807
Put it in my mouth!

2083
01:36:03,808 --> 01:36:06,209
Go, go, go!

2084
01:36:06,210 --> 01:36:07,511
Trudy?

2085
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:10,180
All right, y'all, it's
almost time for the mele,

2086
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:13,181
the Kanikapila luau drum show!

2087
01:36:13,718 --> 01:36:15,787
The special blend.

2088
01:36:15,788 --> 01:36:17,455
Yes, this is a magical drink.

2089
01:36:17,456 --> 01:36:18,556
You know what?

2090
01:36:18,557 --> 01:36:21,326
I'm gonna go get a good spot for
the show. Do you guys wanna come?

2091
01:36:21,327 --> 01:36:22,727
No, no, we're good here.

2092
01:36:22,728 --> 01:36:25,063
Okay. You're fine? Okay.

2093
01:36:25,064 --> 01:36:27,399
And then there was two.

2094
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:29,568
Listen, I want you to come back with me.

2095
01:36:29,569 --> 01:36:31,804
I'm not going back to
the other side with you.

2096
01:36:31,805 --> 01:36:34,406
I'm gonna stay right
here, get my celebration on

2097
01:36:34,407 --> 01:36:36,709
and get another margarita
made up in my face.

2098
01:36:36,710 --> 01:36:38,845
I came a long way to find you.

2099
01:36:38,846 --> 01:36:40,547
Well, I know you ain't
come to get a drink.

2100
01:36:40,548 --> 01:36:42,182
You damn sure ain't come to dance.

2101
01:36:42,183 --> 01:36:43,316
So what'd you follow me here for?

2102
01:36:43,317 --> 01:36:44,384
No. I did.

2103
01:36:44,385 --> 01:36:47,385
I came here to drink, party,
scratch records, do it all!

2104
01:36:47,521 --> 01:36:50,522
Do it... It's just...
Just... Just... You know?

2105
01:36:53,161 --> 01:36:56,161
What am I saying?

2106
01:36:56,431 --> 01:36:59,333
I don't want to do any of those things.

2107
01:37:00,869 --> 01:37:03,870
Truth is that I'm
exhausted just saying them.

2108
01:37:04,907 --> 01:37:07,907
All right, y'all, it's time for
the Kanikapila luau drum show!

2109
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:13,282
Cynthia, hi. Excuse me. Hi.

2110
01:37:13,283 --> 01:37:14,684
Hi. Hey, what are you doing here?

2111
01:37:14,685 --> 01:37:15,785
You all right?

2112
01:37:15,786 --> 01:37:17,687
I'm fine, Jason. I'm watching the show.

2113
01:37:17,688 --> 01:37:20,223
We do have to get back before
sunrise, though. Let's get a move on.

2114
01:37:20,224 --> 01:37:21,357
I don't think that's a good idea, Jason.

2115
01:37:21,358 --> 01:37:22,425
Come on, hon. Let's go.

2116
01:37:22,426 --> 01:37:23,559
We're very close.

2117
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:26,561
Jason, I'm not going anywhere.

2118
01:37:26,965 --> 01:37:29,965
It pains me to say this,
but I gotta let you go.

2119
01:37:32,771 --> 01:37:34,138
I love you.

2120
01:37:34,139 --> 01:37:37,140
But we cannot do this to
each other anymore. It's over.

2121
01:37:39,311 --> 01:37:41,913
It's over.

2122
01:37:41,914 --> 01:37:44,482
Daddy, wait. I was wrong.
I don't want to lose you.

2123
01:37:44,483 --> 01:37:46,151
I'll go back to the other side.

2124
01:37:46,152 --> 01:37:48,820
No. Then you... You,d
be doing what I did.

2125
01:37:48,821 --> 01:37:51,822
Trying to be something that you're not.

2126
01:37:51,958 --> 01:37:54,958
You're 20. Go be 20.

2127
01:37:58,665 --> 01:38:01,067
All right?

2128
01:38:05,773 --> 01:38:08,773
I will not lose you. All
right? I cannot lose you.

2129
01:38:10,077 --> 01:38:11,778
You're the whole reason that I'm here.

2130
01:38:11,779 --> 01:38:13,581
You're the whole reason
that I've done all of this.

2131
01:38:13,582 --> 01:38:16,582
You're the whole reason that I've
made a complete ass out of myself.

2132
01:38:19,154 --> 01:38:22,154
I have failed here miserably.
And that does not bother me.

2133
01:38:25,028 --> 01:38:26,962
What bothers me is
that I have failed you

2134
01:38:26,963 --> 01:38:29,765
and I am not gonna do that ever again.

2135
01:38:29,766 --> 01:38:32,766
All right? I love you a lot.

2136
01:38:39,477 --> 01:38:42,477
Let's go get a drink.

2137
01:38:46,383 --> 01:38:48,686
Oh.

2138
01:38:48,687 --> 01:38:51,687
Honey, it has been forever
since we did something like this.

2139
01:38:53,225 --> 01:38:55,693
Yeah.

2140
01:38:55,694 --> 01:38:58,694
You know, baby, it's funny. Since
we've been here, it's like the therapist

2141
01:38:58,997 --> 01:39:01,566
and the place has made
it like we got a problem.

2142
01:39:01,567 --> 01:39:04,567
But you know what? I think
we don't have a problem.

2143
01:39:05,671 --> 01:39:06,738
No.

2144
01:39:06,739 --> 01:39:09,574
We got a million problems.

2145
01:39:09,575 --> 01:39:11,076
Really? Yeah.

2146
01:39:11,077 --> 01:39:14,078
But, honey, I think everybody
has a million problems.

2147
01:39:14,248 --> 01:39:16,415
I don't know that, like, you,re
supposed to solve them all,

2148
01:39:16,416 --> 01:39:19,416
because the simple truth of it,
sweetheart, is we're married.

2149
01:39:20,153 --> 01:39:23,153
We made a commitment to each
other and to our families.

2150
01:39:23,925 --> 01:39:26,925
And to myself. And I meant it.

2151
01:39:27,529 --> 01:39:28,929
Shane, honey, wait.

2152
01:39:28,930 --> 01:39:30,864
Jennifer, I don't need this.

2153
01:39:30,865 --> 01:39:32,566
I'm done with trying
to make you like me.

2154
01:39:32,567 --> 01:39:34,701
I'm not gonna be the
man you want me to be.

2155
01:39:34,702 --> 01:39:37,205
I'm not gonna do things the
way you want me to do things.

2156
01:39:37,206 --> 01:39:40,206
I'm always gonna wear my heart on
my sleeve because that's who I am.

2157
01:39:40,376 --> 01:39:42,210
And I got a lot of friends that like me

2158
01:39:42,211 --> 01:39:44,846
just because I'm the way I am.

2159
01:39:44,847 --> 01:39:47,848
But it really doesn't
matter because I like me.

2160
01:39:50,954 --> 01:39:52,721
Well, I don't like you.

2161
01:39:52,722 --> 01:39:55,722
Whatever. I love you.

2162
01:39:56,860 --> 01:39:59,529
I can't stand picking out tiles.

2163
01:39:59,530 --> 01:40:02,299
It drives me nuts to try
to redo the fricking house.

2164
01:40:02,300 --> 01:40:03,967
I know it does.

2165
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:06,436
But, you know, the one thing
that we can and should always do

2166
01:40:06,437 --> 01:40:09,437
is just kind of have
fun with each other.

2167
01:40:09,907 --> 01:40:12,643
And truthfully, sweetheart, that
should be the easiest thing to do

2168
01:40:12,644 --> 01:40:14,278
because before there was the kids

2169
01:40:14,279 --> 01:40:17,279
or the house or the job or any of it,

2170
01:40:17,816 --> 01:40:19,116
there was just you.

2171
01:40:19,117 --> 01:40:20,818
And I love you, Ronnie.

2172
01:40:20,819 --> 01:40:23,820
I love you, too, Dave.

2173
01:40:31,965 --> 01:40:34,965
Hey, now, all you naughty boys and
girls, gather 'round, gather 'round.

2174
01:40:37,271 --> 01:40:39,439
The hell's she doing here?

2175
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:40,506
Who?

2176
01:40:40,507 --> 01:40:43,507
That's my wife. She
must be looking for me.

2177
01:40:43,777 --> 01:40:46,346
I don't think so. She looks fine.

2178
01:40:46,347 --> 01:40:49,348
You should just relax.

2179
01:40:50,485 --> 01:40:53,485
Son of a...

2180
01:40:56,191 --> 01:40:59,192
Excuse me!

2181
01:40:59,362 --> 01:41:00,695
Hey!

2182
01:41:00,696 --> 01:41:03,098
Peacock!

2183
01:41:03,099 --> 01:41:06,099
Please, I don't want to hurt you.

2184
01:41:08,804 --> 01:41:11,273
"Encouragement!" Joey!

2185
01:41:11,274 --> 01:41:12,708
Baby, remember when we first met

2186
01:41:12,709 --> 01:41:15,709
and I told you that you were
the only man I'd ever been with?

2187
01:41:15,979 --> 01:41:17,480
You lied? No, no, no, no, no.

2188
01:41:17,481 --> 01:41:20,481
I was... I was completely inexperienced,

2189
01:41:20,951 --> 01:41:23,553
and, honey, I didn't
know what I had in you.

2190
01:41:23,554 --> 01:41:24,821
I've been cheating on you!

2191
01:41:24,822 --> 01:41:26,890
I've been cheating on
you every chance I got!

2192
01:41:26,891 --> 01:41:28,225
Yeah? For years, I've
been cheating on you.

2193
01:41:28,226 --> 01:41:30,727
Well, I cheated on you
with more than one guy!

2194
01:41:30,728 --> 01:41:32,996
With two... You had a
three-way with two dudes?

2195
01:41:32,997 --> 01:41:34,465
No, no! But I would have!

2196
01:41:34,466 --> 01:41:37,068
I totally would have!
Well, I would've, too!

2197
01:41:37,069 --> 01:41:39,070
Not with two dudes! You
know what I'm talking about!

2198
01:41:39,071 --> 01:41:42,071
I thought I needed to know what it
was like out there, in a real way,

2199
01:41:42,408 --> 01:41:45,408
not like I read it in Cosmo. So
I went out there and I lived it.

2200
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,180
I've had one-night stands!

2201
01:41:48,181 --> 01:41:49,248
Okay.

2202
01:41:49,249 --> 01:41:51,250
I've woken up in beds with men

2203
01:41:51,251 --> 01:41:53,252
whose names I didn't even remember!

2204
01:41:53,253 --> 01:41:54,920
I was like, "'How did
l get this T-shirt on?,'

2205
01:41:54,921 --> 01:41:56,722
Jennifer, I get it. Land your plane.

2206
01:41:56,723 --> 01:41:58,090
Just deal with it! You deal with it.

2207
01:41:58,091 --> 01:42:00,393
You deal... You deal with
going to Applebee's alone.

2208
01:42:00,394 --> 01:42:02,162
What? If you don't put in effort,

2209
01:42:02,163 --> 01:42:04,764
you're gonna be the one who
ends up at Applebee's alone.

2210
01:42:04,765 --> 01:42:06,833
Are you asking me to go
to Applebee's with you?

2211
01:42:06,834 --> 01:42:08,935
The bottom line is that none of them

2212
01:42:08,936 --> 01:42:11,872
made me feel the love that you did.

2213
01:42:11,873 --> 01:42:14,709
And I had to go out into the world

2214
01:42:14,710 --> 01:42:17,710
in order for me to come back
and say that I belong home.

2215
01:42:17,779 --> 01:42:20,181
Now I'm gonna keep on
spinning these fly tunes

2216
01:42:20,182 --> 01:42:22,551
until somebody gets something going on!

2217
01:42:22,552 --> 01:42:24,286
I'm not saying I wouldn't
go to Applebee's with you!

2218
01:42:24,287 --> 01:42:26,088
Well, I'm not saying I wouldn't
go to Applebee's with you!

2219
01:42:26,089 --> 01:42:27,789
All right, well, I would try
to go to Applebee's with you.

2220
01:42:27,790 --> 01:42:29,024
Well, I would try to go
to Applebee's with you!

2221
01:42:29,025 --> 01:42:32,025
So let's try. I want
to try! Well, let's try!

2222
01:42:33,964 --> 01:42:36,964
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

2223
01:42:38,936 --> 01:42:41,936
I am so sorry that it took all of that.

2224
01:42:44,308 --> 01:42:47,309
But you know what? Now I can
honestly say, with love in my heart'

2225
01:42:48,446 --> 01:42:51,446
that you are my man.

2226
01:42:53,051 --> 01:42:55,385
Could you ever love me again?

2227
01:42:55,386 --> 01:42:58,387
Well, you're my wife.

2228
01:42:58,491 --> 01:43:01,491
And I never stopped loving you.

2229
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:04,560
Now come here and give me a kiss.

2230
01:43:07,399 --> 01:43:10,400
This next jam goes out to all
you party people in the house!

2231
01:43:10,971 --> 01:43:12,104
And that time that you got sick,

2232
01:43:12,105 --> 01:43:13,172
you didn't want me to see you,

2233
01:43:13,173 --> 01:43:14,340
so you locked me out of the bathroom?

2234
01:43:14,341 --> 01:43:16,142
No! Then I passed out!

2235
01:43:16,143 --> 01:43:17,243
Yeah.

2236
01:43:17,244 --> 01:43:18,310
And you called the ambulance.

2237
01:43:18,311 --> 01:43:19,745
Well, because, before you passed out,

2238
01:43:19,746 --> 01:43:21,113
it sounded like you were dying in there.

2239
01:43:21,114 --> 01:43:22,282
You know? I thought I was dying. I did.

2240
01:43:22,283 --> 01:43:23,450
Yeah, well, what was I supposed to do?

2241
01:43:23,451 --> 01:43:25,418
I should have broken down the door.

2242
01:43:25,419 --> 01:43:27,420
You've been a really good friend.

2243
01:43:27,421 --> 01:43:30,421
You have been the best
friend in the world to me.

2244
01:43:31,759 --> 01:43:33,327
Now don't stop dancing, y'all!

2245
01:43:33,328 --> 01:43:36,328
Party ain't over! It's far from over!

2246
01:44:05,329 --> 01:44:08,329
Silence, please! Silence!

2247
01:44:09,835 --> 01:44:12,835
I made a program for you and
you decided not to follow it.

2248
01:44:14,005 --> 01:44:17,005
You defied my instructions
and you went off course.

2249
01:44:17,709 --> 01:44:19,977
Why are we being held to a
different standard, Marcel?

2250
01:44:19,978 --> 01:44:21,246
You weren't here on time this morning.

2251
01:44:21,247 --> 01:44:24,247
I was here before
sunrise, sadly, by myself.

2252
01:44:24,417 --> 01:44:27,352
Therefore, I chose not to wait.

2253
01:44:27,353 --> 01:44:28,753
Marcel, I've got to be honest with you.

2254
01:44:28,754 --> 01:44:29,855
You know... Silence!

2255
01:44:29,856 --> 01:44:32,157
No, you silence! Please, just...

2256
01:44:32,158 --> 01:44:35,159
I don't need some speech
about moments, okay?

2257
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:37,263
No more, okay?

2258
01:44:37,264 --> 01:44:39,098
I'm sorry that we kept
you waiting this morning

2259
01:44:39,099 --> 01:44:40,700
and that we didn't respect your program,

2260
01:44:40,701 --> 01:44:43,102
but last night my wife and l,

2261
01:44:43,103 --> 01:44:45,939
we spent some real time together,

2262
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:47,574
and for the first time in a long time,

2263
01:44:47,575 --> 01:44:50,043
we woke up actually very, very happy.

2264
01:44:50,044 --> 01:44:52,112
So, with all due respect, sir,

2265
01:44:52,113 --> 01:44:54,414
I don't need you, or
anyone else for that matter,

2266
01:44:54,415 --> 01:44:57,416
to, you know, say anything, really.

2267
01:44:57,953 --> 01:44:59,220
I know.

2268
01:44:59,221 --> 01:45:00,288
Sorry?

2269
01:45:00,289 --> 01:45:01,456
You do?

2270
01:45:01,457 --> 01:45:04,457
Yes.

2271
01:45:05,227 --> 01:45:08,228
That is why I am giving you this.

2272
01:45:08,265 --> 01:45:10,199
I don't understand.

2273
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:13,200
I could never reveal your
true inner animal spirit.

2274
01:45:14,537 --> 01:45:17,373
It was always up to you.

2275
01:45:17,374 --> 01:45:20,375
Cynthia, Jason, your
spirit is the rabbit.

2276
01:45:22,713 --> 01:45:25,713
No matter what obstacles
are put in front of him,

2277
01:45:25,783 --> 01:45:28,485
the rabbit will scrape and burrow

2278
01:45:28,486 --> 01:45:31,486
and find a way to create his home.

2279
01:45:33,825 --> 01:45:35,826
Thank you. Thank you.

2280
01:45:35,827 --> 01:45:38,827
Lucy, Joseph.

2281
01:45:39,164 --> 01:45:42,164
For you,

2282
01:45:43,268 --> 01:45:44,970
the wolf.

2283
01:45:44,971 --> 01:45:47,971
The wolf is by nature a pack animal

2284
01:45:48,341 --> 01:45:50,442
and one of the few proud members

2285
01:45:50,443 --> 01:45:53,443
of the animal kingdom
that mates for life.

2286
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:54,813
Congratulations.

2287
01:45:54,814 --> 01:45:56,449
Thank you.

2288
01:45:56,450 --> 01:45:59,352
Hello, Jen. Welcome, Jennifer.

2289
01:45:59,353 --> 01:46:01,354
Thank you.

2290
01:46:01,355 --> 01:46:04,355
For you,

2291
01:46:04,625 --> 01:46:06,859
the noble honeybee.

2292
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:08,862
The honeybee is committed.

2293
01:46:08,863 --> 01:46:11,863
And though it may fly
from flower to flower,

2294
01:46:12,367 --> 01:46:15,336
collecting the sweet, sticky nectar'

2295
01:46:15,337 --> 01:46:18,337
it has no choice but
to return to the hive.

2296
01:46:19,508 --> 01:46:20,875
Congratulations.

2297
01:46:20,876 --> 01:46:23,712
Thank you. That's a big-ass bee.

2298
01:46:23,713 --> 01:46:25,947
Finally, Ronnie and David.

2299
01:46:25,948 --> 01:46:28,883
I have thought long and hard about this.

2300
01:46:28,884 --> 01:46:31,554
I could not decide with my mind.

2301
01:46:31,555 --> 01:46:34,555
I had to open my soul
to the animal spirits.

2302
01:46:35,325 --> 01:46:36,892
And, finally...

2303
01:46:36,893 --> 01:46:38,661
Okay, the build-up's killing me.

2304
01:46:38,662 --> 01:46:40,730
What do we got here? Two cheetahs?

2305
01:46:40,731 --> 01:46:43,200
Couple of eagles? You got two lions?

2306
01:46:43,201 --> 01:46:46,201
The ass.

2307
01:46:46,404 --> 01:46:49,404
You are the ass.

2308
01:46:50,308 --> 01:46:52,676
Stubborn and immovable.

2309
01:46:52,677 --> 01:46:55,678
The mighty ass tirelessly bears
the heavy burden of others.

2310
01:46:58,250 --> 01:47:01,250
But when the ass is on the
move, nothing can stop the ass.

2311
01:47:04,189 --> 01:47:07,190
Be an ass for your marriage.
Be an ass for your children.

2312
01:47:08,661 --> 01:47:11,397
Be an ass for love.

2313
01:47:11,398 --> 01:47:14,398
Thank you, Marcel.

2314
01:47:15,268 --> 01:47:18,268
I'm gonna be the biggest
ass you've ever seen.

2315
01:47:21,776 --> 01:47:24,776
And now, you may spend the rest
of your trip enjoying the island.

2316
01:47:26,347 --> 01:47:29,347
Please feel free to make Eden
into your own, personal Sandals.

2317
01:47:31,186 --> 01:47:33,020
Yes.

2318
01:47:33,021 --> 01:47:35,189
And now, jet skis!

2319
01:47:35,190 --> 01:47:38,190
Yes, yes! Yes!

2320
01:47:41,630 --> 01:47:43,198
Hey, hey, what's happening?

2321
01:47:43,199 --> 01:47:44,966
I sure miss you guys.

2322
01:47:44,967 --> 01:47:46,301
I miss you so much.

2323
01:47:46,302 --> 01:47:49,302
And Grandpa Jim Jim let us watch Jaws!

2324
01:47:49,906 --> 01:47:52,240
We get to eat all the candy we want!

2325
01:47:52,241 --> 01:47:53,642
Hey, guys, the jet skis are ready!

2326
01:47:53,643 --> 01:47:54,777
Come on! We're waiting on you!

2327
01:47:54,778 --> 01:47:56,646
Give us one second with the
kids. We'll be there in a minute.

2328
01:47:56,647 --> 01:47:57,814
Go ahead and start. Well, listen,

2329
01:47:57,815 --> 01:48:00,049
when we get back next weekend,
we'll go to Medieval Times

2330
01:48:00,050 --> 01:48:01,484
and we'll get some big drumsticks

2331
01:48:01,485 --> 01:48:03,319
and lots of meat.
- Yes!

2332
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:05,321
And we're gonna be doing a lot
more of that fun stuff, guys,

2333
01:48:05,322 --> 01:48:07,091
so get ready, okay? I'm gonna take you

2334
01:48:07,092 --> 01:48:08,492
to the school parking
lot, we'll do some donuts.

2335
01:48:08,493 --> 01:48:09,726
Yeah! Donuts!

2336
01:48:09,727 --> 01:48:10,828
All right, I love you.

2337
01:48:10,829 --> 01:48:13,330
Love you, too. Here's Grandpa Jim Jim.

2338
01:48:13,331 --> 01:48:15,666
All right. Enjoy your last few days.

2339
01:48:15,667 --> 01:48:17,734
Hey, Dad, could you do me a favor

2340
01:48:17,735 --> 01:48:19,971
and not give them candy
every time they ask?

2341
01:48:19,972 --> 01:48:22,774
You ought to be thanking me.
I'm here at this home store

2342
01:48:22,775 --> 01:48:25,775
returning some of the stuff
that you had on that house list.

2343
01:48:25,845 --> 01:48:27,912
Okay, thanks so much. When you..
- When you look at the coating,

2344
01:48:27,913 --> 01:48:29,614
will you beat that guy up on the price?

2345
01:48:29,615 --> 01:48:32,251
Kevin! That is not a real toilet.

2346
01:48:32,252 --> 01:48:33,986
Dad, what's going on?
Is everything okay?

2347
01:48:33,987 --> 01:48:35,754
Please tell me he's
not peeing in the store.

2348
01:48:35,755 --> 01:48:38,424
It's nice to take a
moment and just relax.

2349
01:48:38,425 --> 01:48:39,658
Dad? I gotta go.

2350
01:48:39,659 --> 01:48:42,195
I don't know him and there's
no way I'm going near him.

2351
01:48:42,196 --> 01:48:45,196
Grandpa, there's no toilet paper.

2352
01:48:47,869 --> 01:48:50,869
Help me get my shirt off.

2353
01:53:14,892 --> 01:53:17,660
You know, the Federal Reserve is a pimp.

2354
01:53:17,661 --> 01:53:20,661
They want you to be in debt.

2355
01:53:20,664 --> 01:53:23,132
That's how it works. They
give you these credit cards

2356
01:53:23,133 --> 01:53:25,568
you can't pay for,

2357
01:53:25,569 --> 01:53:28,570
HD, motorcycles. It's all a pimp game.

2358
01:53:29,305 --> 01:54:29,869
