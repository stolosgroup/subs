00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:12,041
<i>If you've painted with me before...</i>

2
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:15,666
<i>...you probably know
that I love to make big trees.</i>

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,666
- <i>Oh. How big are we talking?</i>
<i>- Humongous.</i>

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,791
- <i>Oh!</i>
<i>- Absolutely humongous trees</i>

5
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,833
<i>with leaves and beautiful limbs.</i>

6
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:27,166
I've always found
Bob Ross very sexy.

7
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,375
You know, that hair,
the mom jeans. I'm all in.

8
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:32,500
- I am.
- Oh my God.

9
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:36,083
I totally forgot to tell you this.
I was watching Katie sleep earlier on.

10
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:38,791
I did that thing
where I fast forward into the future

11
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,666
and I can see
who she's become and whatnot.

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,166
And I did it, and it was incredible.
She's a podiatrist.

13
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,666
Our child's a podiatrist?

14
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,333
In Cleveland. Doing really well.
Third biggest in her firm.

15
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:55,083
She drives a Lexus. Like,
four years old, but it's pretty good.

16
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:58,166
I... I always thought she'd be like
a... a... a butcher.

17
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,250
- A butcher?
- Mm-hmm. A butcher.

18
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,875
A v... a vegan butcher.

19
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:05,208
You know, so she'd take carrots
and carve little rib eyes,

20
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:08,375
or her pork chops
that'd really be made from cauliflower.

21
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,500
Do you think that we should
put a bird up there?

22
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:14,333
Uh, birds are tricky.

23
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,256
Ah, you just need to be gentle
with them.

24
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,875
Hello.

25
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:21,916
- Aw! Look who's awake.
- Did you have a lovely little nap, Katie?

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,625
Did you?

27
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,583
Would you like to inspect your wall?

28
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,208
- Ta-da!
- Pretty good.

29
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:33,041
She can tell I'm not a painter.
She's so smart. Mama's little butcher.

30
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:36,625
- Who's daddy's little podiatrist?
- Or mama's little butcher.

31
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:37,750
Yeah, that's you.

32
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,083
Yeah, it is.

33
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,500

35
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:17,017
Can you believe this guy
used to be a therapist?

36
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,625
He can't even talk to animals.

37
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,416
And now he has to talk to animals
and owners.

38
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,583
It's so frustrating.

Stop. You know what?

64
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,541
- More left.
- To my left?

65
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,125
Yeah, to your left. Okay.

66
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,250
Now, slide it, slide it all.

67
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,875
This way. A little more.

68
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,375
Too much.

69
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:21,875
Okay, there.

70
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:24,333
Hey, shouldn't we be doing
inventory right now?

71
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,416
You know what?

72
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,041
- Oh, here.
- Give me two.

73
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,125
Coming up.

Lilly.

75
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:35,875
I can drive to the Superstore
and get two of these for four bucks.

76
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,583
Lilly?

77
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,333
Lilly?

78
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,541
Oh!

79
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,083
- Mrs. Oberhoffer.
- Those will rot your teeth.

80
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,166
Only if you eat 'em by the dozen.

81
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,750
- You go inventory something.
- Okay.

82
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,083
How's everything, dear?

83
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,416
Everything's good.

84
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,625
How are things with Jack?

85
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,541
He's just great. Yeah. I...
Thanks for asking.

86
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,541
I'll be sure
to tell him that you said hello.

87
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,166
I was talking to the pastor.

88
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:12,750
And we would like to come over for a visit

89
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:13,958
and talk with you.

90
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,500
I cannot imagine what you've been through.

<i>Lilly to
the freezer aisle. Lilly, freezer aisle.</i>

92
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,583
Give the pastor my best.

93
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,555
I'll shoot straight with you, Lilly.

94
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:30,000
People have been noticing
you're acting sort of funny.

95
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,541
What do you mean, "funny"?

96
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,291
You know,

97
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:38,500
with that thing, all that's goin' on.
You're distracted.

98
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,208
I'm not distracted.

99
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,500
Sweet tiny Jesus.

100
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,458
What the hell is that? Gum selfie?

101
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,125
Everyone is distracted.

102
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,916
- Nobody works.
- Okay, Travis.

103
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You know that I have to go
to that meeting in Rosewood tonight.

104
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,875
- So maybe we can just pick...
- Again?

105
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,000
Well, that's...

106
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,250
It's every Tuesday.
It's gonna be at least once a week.

107
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,500
- So...
- You see?

108
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,541
That's what I'm talking about.
You're my right-hand man, Lilly.

109
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,875
But your mind's not in the game.

110
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,833
What good's a pro ball QB
without a left tackle?

111
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,583
- Ah.
- Who's gonna pick up the blitz?

112
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,083
I don't really follow football, so...

113
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:13,208
Well...

114
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,875
get with it.

115
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,458
Okay.

116
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,791
Sherri, no more selfies.

117
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,208
Bubblegum or otherwise. Okay?

118
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,708
We've talked about this.

119
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,166
Golly Wally! You're Lilly.

120
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:08,916
Uh... Oh!

121
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,458
- Yeah, that's my name.
- Mm-hmm.

122
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,000
- Um, he's getting these, right?
- Yep.

123
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,916
Every week. I'll buzz you in.

124
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,333
Hello.

125
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:26,291
Hi, everyone.
It's so great to see you tonight.

126
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,833
- Hey.
- How are you?

127
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,583
- Hi, baby.
- I'm doing great.

128
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:30,666
Yeah?

129
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,833
- Yeah.
- You look good.

130
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:36,041
Okay, everyone.
Let's take our seats.

131
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,791
I believe we left off last time

132
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,833
talking about emotional triggers.

133
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:43,375
Does anyone have any thoughts
or questions about that?

134
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,125
No?

135
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,416
Okay. Well, as always...

136
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,625
You know me.
I'm a sucker to peer pressure.

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,666
Yeah, but you hate those things.

138
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:56,375
They've got all these flavors now.

139
00:08:56,458 --> 00:09:00,333
Okay.
So, tonight I'd like to talk about trust.

140
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,958
Lilly, let's start with you and Jack.

141
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,125
Okay, sure.

142
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,958
Some families have a hard time adjusting

143
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,541
after they've been apart
for an extended time.

144
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,208
Seeing how things
are going to be different.

145
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,833
I don't think
that's gonna be a problem for us.

146
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,791
I... I can see that would be
for some people, but...

147
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,708
Well,

148
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:24,166
changes are scary,
but that doesn't have to be a bad thing.

149
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,000
Scary? We're not...

150
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,000
We're not scared. Right? I mean, that's...

151
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,458
- They scared. They scared.
- She's fine.

152
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,166
Of course I'm fine. You're fine too.

153
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,458
Is that true, Jack?

154
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:41,208
Let's just move on, shall we?
Lot of people to get to.

155
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,291
It's just that we...

156
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,625
we haven't actually
talked about it, but I mean, I...

157
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,500
- We haven't. I mean...
- I mean, look.

158
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,166
If you wanna talk about it,
let's talk about it. By all means.

159
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,083
Great. We should do that. Talk about it.

160
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,666
Let's talk about something
other than vaping.

161
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,833
What's next week? Meth?

162
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:04,291
- Really?
- Not appropriate. Not appropriate, Lilly.

163
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,500
It's just, it's a joke. I don't mean that.

164
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:11,791
Never mind that. She has turned
my only son against me. What about that?

165
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,125
Mother, you know I haven't...

166
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,916
- I am not your mother!
- Can we talk about something else?

167
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,875
You know, I saw her on TV
with that Dr. Phil.

168
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,333
- Velma.
- Scheming to have him tie my tubes.

169
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,666
- Mama, calm down.
- Mother.

170
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,583
- I am not your mother!
- Velma.

171
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,208
- Velma, sit down.
- Don't you talk to me!

172
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:31,541
Why do you keep telling me to be calm?
I am calm!

173
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,166
Lilly.

174
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,041
- Lilly!
- Ugh.

175
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,333
You got a sec?

176
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,166
- Yeah.
- That didn't go so well.

177
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,041
I don't know. I think Velma
made some real progress tonight.

178
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,750
I deserve that one.

179
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,416
Not what you call a ringing endorsement
for psychiatric care.

180
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,083
How's he doing?

181
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:57,666
Really?

182
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,916
It's gonna take some time, Lilly.
He's been through a lot.

183
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,833
Yeah. Well, that's the way it looks.

184
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:07,625
And what about you?
Are you getting back to a normal routine?

185
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,791
Have you done anything
with Katie's things?

186
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:14,361
- What does that have to do with anything?
- Emotional triggers like that are tough.

187
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,083
Are you saying
I should get rid of her things?

188
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,208
No. I... I don't know.

189
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,708
How would that make you feel?

190
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,416
I think it's getting late,
and I should get a move on.

191
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,083
Lilly, when you come here...

192
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,966
...do you get anything
out of it for yourself?

193
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,541
Yes, yes, but let's...
let's keep the focus on Jack.

194
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,791
We're doing that.
But are you seeing anyone?

195
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,583
I see people all the time.
I see you right now.

196
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,500
Okay, Lilly.

197
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,125
You have to do the work too.

198
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,416
Okay. Well, great.

199
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:02,125
You know, there's a guy I used
to work with that lives down your way.

200
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,291
A therapist.

201
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,500
Maybe you could give him a call.

202
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,583
Larry Fine?

203
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,208
Like <i>The Three Stooges?</i>

204
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,666
He's a good guy, Lilly.

205
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,500
Someone you could talk to.

206
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,875
Sure thing, Regina.

207
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,833
You know, it'd be nice to see someone,
Lilly, before you have to see someone.

208
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,791
Yeah. Well, I'll see you next week.

209
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,708
- Oh, hello, Jack. Wait.
- Thank you.

210
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:37,958
From Lilly.

211
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,083
She's consistent.

212
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:41,875
Is that a bad thing?

213
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:49,708
Thank you.

214
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,208

00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,875
Oh!

241
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Shit.

242
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:33,958
Son of a bitch.

243
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,750
- <i>How are you sleeping?</i>
- Terrific. Thank you.

244
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,750
- Are you eating okay?
- Oh, yes.

245
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:49,791
Yes. I mean,
the food up here is exquisite.

246
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,958
I don't know if they give Michelin stars
to mental health facilities,

247
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,125
but if they did...

248
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:01,708
And the medication.

249
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,000
How is it working?

250
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,833
I really don't know.

251
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,500
- What do you think?
- It's not about what I think.

00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,125
Well...

253
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,958
Has your wife come in to see you?

254
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,041
My wife?

255
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,791

256
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:23,625
Y-Y-You know,
I've actually been meaning to ask, um,

257
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,583
does that have to happen so much?

258
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,291
The visits. I mean, it's just

259
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,625
I feel bad about her having to come
the whole way up here every week.

260
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:39,333

- Oh.
- Hi. Thank you.

289

No, I... I think once they're done,
they're, you know...

Sorry for your loss.

292
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,000
Okay. Bye.

293
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,083
Can I help you?

294
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,916
Uh, no. I just think I've made a mistake.

295
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,291
Are you here to see Dr. Larry?

296
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:58,000
- Uh, well, is it... is it Larry Fine?
- We just go by Dr. Larry.

297
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:58,958
Oh.

298
00:22:59,041 --> 00:22:59,916
Lilly Maynard?

299
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,791
Uh, yes. That's, uh...

300
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:04,916
- Oh! Okay. Wow! Oh!
- Helen.

301
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,541
Helen, please.

302
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:09,500
All right. I can't help it.
What do you think I'm here for?

303
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:10,833
Sorry.

304
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:12,500
Uh, what's your pet's name?

305
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:15,875
Well, uh, that's just it.
I... I don't have a pet.

306
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,208
- No pet?
- No.

307
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:20,166
Uh, Dr. Larry,

308
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,750
uh, Lilly has an appointment but no pet.

309
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,583
That's a first.

310
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:25,500
Oh.

311
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:28,083
Oh my. Hey! Buddy, I'm married.

312
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,666
I get this 24 hours a day.

313
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:34,726
- I want his marbles knocked off.
- Helen, it's called neutering.

314
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:38,208
Nobody's here to get
their marbles knocked off, I presume.

315
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,083
Uh, I'm as advertised.

316
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:43,708
Did you have a question
about an animal or what?

317
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,791
Well, uh, no, I don't.

00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:49,541
I... I had gotten a referral for you
from a gal.

319
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:50,625
A gal?

320
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:52,916
Regina Miller?

321
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,458
Is she still with the state?

322
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,541
Uh, she's at New Horizons.

323
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,791
Oh.

324
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:03,708
Oh.

325
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:07,375
Well, I have taken up enough of your time,
so thank you.

326
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:09,500
No, no, no. Why don't you come on back?

327
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:10,916
Come on back. Him too.

328
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,875
Oh, that's how it is.

329
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:15,416
Not you.

330
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,916
Sit. Sit.

331
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:18,458
Down.

332
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,583
Stay.

333
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,750
- Come.
- Yep.

334
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,541
Am I supposed to be in here?

335
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:29,666
He doesn't mind.
Don't understand why Regina did that.

336
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:34,041
I've been out of the mental health field.
I left it ten years ago.

337
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,166
To become a vet?

338
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,291
- Mm-hmm.
- Isn't that kind of weird?

339
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:41,500
It's an easy explanation really,
but, uh, let's leave it at weird.

340
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:44,791
What were you doing at, uh, New Horizons?

341
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,333
Well, I wasn't. I mean, I was,

342
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:50,625
but my husband is, you know, there.

343
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,601
- Is he getting better?
- I guess.

344
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,500
- He says he's fine.
- Well, that's good.

345
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:59,291
- What about you?
- Me? Oh, I'm fine too.

346
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,208
Regina sent you to see me
because you're fine.

347
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:04,541
Well, it wasn't my idea.

348
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:06,208
- But you're here.
- Yeah.

349
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:07,291
I, uh...

350
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:11,375
You know,
she said it might help him a little

351
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:14,375
if I did some work, so...

352
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:18,708
I also... I also kind of traded in
some of my furniture,

353
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:23,416
most of my furniture,
for a pleather La-Z-Boy.

354
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:26,166
Um,

355
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,125
I mean, not all of it, but...

356
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,083
My daughter, our baby, died.

357
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:35,375
Just over a year ago now, so...

358
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:38,875
SIDS, that's what they told us.

359
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:40,458
Oh.

360
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,750
That's awful.

361
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,083
My husband Jack didn't handle it so good.

362
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:49,666
And you did?

363
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:52,750
No. No, I...

364
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:54,833
No, I'm...

365
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:00,208
It's a good question.

366
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:04,166
Okay, well...

367
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:09,166
I just don't do
this sort of thing anymore.

368
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,208
Well, no offense,
but you can kind of tell.

369
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:18,333
Maybe Regina can set you up
with someone else.

370
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:20,666
Yeah. Yeah.

371
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:22,208
Okay.

372
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:24,976
If you have an animal problem,
you know where to find me.

373
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,041
Thank you.

374
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:29,541
Trigger, hang in there, pal.
It doesn't get better.

375
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:38,541
Sarah, that's very good, but<i>...</i>
Okay, okay, don't, um...

376
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:41,958
Relax. Treat it gently. You don't have to
beat it to death, darling.

377
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,958
Oh, Velma, that's... What is that?

378
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:47,166
- It's an emoji.
- Ah-ha.

379
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,601
- The poop one.
- Looks very accurate.

380
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:53,250
- When do I get to put it in the oven?
- Soon, dear. Very soon.

381
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:54,708
Jack.

382
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:56,541
That's beautiful.

383
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:02,125
I have some finer utensils
back behind the shelf over there.

384
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:07,125
Good work. It's more even this time.

385
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,375
Keep going. Keep going.

386
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:24,500
You found the utensils.

387
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:26,125
Yeah.

388
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:28,416
Um, what's that from?

389
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,416
It's just some old junk
from back when this was a school.

390
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:35,000
- What happened to it?
- The school?

391
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:37,416
Not enough kids.

392
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,333
Come on, let's go finish your vase.

393
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:42,708
It's done.

394
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:26,791
Go on! Get the hell out of here!

395
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:29,375
Go! This is my garden!

396
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:32,458
And don't come back!

397
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:35,916
Hi, Lilly.

398
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:38,583
- Who are you talking to?
- You, Chuck.

399
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:39,666
Oh.

400
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:42,833
No. I'm sorry. Chuck, I was just mess...

401
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,458
Ow!

402
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:52,833
Oh.

403
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:55,000
<i>Well,
it doesn't need stitches.</i>

404
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:57,750
- You got a tetanus shot recently?
- Do I need one?

405
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:59,208
Just to be safe.

406
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:02,291
The bird obviously thought
you were a threat.

407
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:04,125
Well, I am now.

408
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:08,125
It's, uh, breeding season, you know?

409
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:11,958
Eggs, hatchlings, that sort of thing.

410
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:15,333
- You might wanna stay out of your yard.
- It's my fucking yard.

411
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:19,166
You always this angry?

412
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:22,083
What am I supposed to do,
call the cops?

413
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:25,750
I mean, you said call
if I had an animal problem.

414
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:29,708
Are you familiar with stage three
of the grieving process?

415
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:33,291
I'm assuming that follows stage two?

416
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:34,625
Not, uh, necessarily.

417
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,000
But generally.

418
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:38,166
Uh, it's "bargaining and anger."

419
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,958
Nobody ever talked to you about this?

420
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:45,750
Nope. What comes after that?

421
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:47,750
Depression.

422
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,791
Great. I can't wait.

423
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:53,041
Mmm, you might not have to wait too long.

424
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,208
Jeez.

425
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:56,375
So you're done.

426
00:29:58,083 --> 00:29:59,083
Thanks.

427
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:02,416
- Look, um, sorry about the hassle.
- No hassle.

428
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:06,833
I guess I'm gonna try to find
one of those people doctors.

429
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:08,583
Okay.

430
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:16,083
Um... Uh, excuse me.

431
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:18,083
What... What did the bird look like?

432
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:22,250
Um, I don't know. Dark, wings.

433
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:23,833
That... that narrows it down.

434
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:25,250
Why?

435
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:26,625
Um...

436
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:31,083
You know, if... if you...
if you would like to, you know,

437
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:32,833
talk about it.

438
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:34,625
Maybe talk<i>...</i> talk about the bird?

439
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,500
Yeah, the bird.

440
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:39,833
All right.

441
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:41,875
Yeah.

442
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:42,958
Okay, well...

443
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,916
see you later.

444
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,875
Yeah.

445
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:49,541
In... In the meantime, stay away
from that new neighbor of yours.

446
00:30:50,041 --> 00:30:52,375
Yeah, new neighbor.
That... That's a good one.

447
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:07,648
Uh, you don't want that one.

448
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:11,083
Fungus.

449
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:12,666
Oh.

450
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:15,500
No, I don't... I don't want fungus peppers.

451
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:16,958
Who does?

452
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:21,166
Do you have anything
that might, um, scare birds away?

453
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:23,291
- Bird deterrent?
- Yeah.

454
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:25,375
- Bird-go-away-ent.
- That's funny.

455
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:26,916
I like a good joke.

456
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,458
How do you feel about spikes?

457
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:33,333
No, I don't, kinda, need to kebab 'em.

458
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:35,208
Um,

459
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:36,875
got it.

460
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:40,166
Huh. Kind of, um,

461
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,958
Asian beach ball.

462
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:45,041
Yeah. I got one by my pool. No birds come.

463
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:46,791
No people either.

464
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:50,250
You know? Got it.

465
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,583
Am I supposed to be following you? I...

466
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:02,416
Mother...

467
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,208
Scares the shit out of birds too.

468
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,041
I'll take it.

469
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:22,083
How's that, you little shit?

470
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:38,041
<i>When my wife passed away,
I didn't think I could continue.</i>

471
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:39,958
<i>I didn't know how to.</i>

472
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,125
<i>And if I'm being honest,
I still don't know how to,</i>

473
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:44,750
<i>but I do.</i>

474
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:49,500
<i>Every morning I ask for strength
and the courage to move forward</i>

475
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:51,916
<i>and be there for others.</i>

476
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,875
<i>Amen. You know,
pastor, you made that difference for me...</i>

477
00:32:58,833 --> 00:32:59,833
Hello?

478
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:08,625
Never gonna believe what I'm watching.

479
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,666
It's one of those religious shows,
<i>The Higher Power.</i>

480
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:15,291
Sounds like a utility company.

481
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:17,708
<i>Or a pot store.</i>

482
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:19,375
<i>Do the kids still call it pot?</i>

483
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:22,833
Feels like they'd have
a cooler way of saying that now

484
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:26,166
or an emoji, or...
Well, I'm sure they have an emoji, right?

485
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,208
They have it for everything.

486
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:32,583
Hey, guess what?
I got the garden going again.

487
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:36,125
<i>I found the watering can
you painted with Katie.</i>

488
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:38,833
<i>It was buried in the brush.</i>

489
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:41,375
<i>Almost hit it with a lawn mower.</i>

490
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:52,166
<i>...and the higher power.</i>

491
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:55,291
<i>In God's name we should pray,</i>

492
00:33:57,958 --> 00:33:59,666
<i>Exodus says,</i>

493
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:05,041
<i>"And they make their lives bitter
with hard bondage</i>

494
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:09,458
<i>in mortar of service in the field</i>

495
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:12,208
<i>wherein they made them serve</i>

496
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:14,041
<i>with vigor."</i>

497
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,291
- Water?
- I'm good. Thanks

498
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:29,125
Good. Bye.

499
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:31,916
See you later.

500
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:07,916
That's the one, officer.

501
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,666
The great-tailed grackle.

502
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:15,666
Well, he's a little far afield
from the Okeechobee Swamps of Florida.

503
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,000
Maybe he's lost.

504
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:22,791
Guess you don't talk
with your patients that often.

505
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:26,041
Oh, you mean 'cause they're animals?
Oh no, we talk all the time.

506
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,958
Tends to be a one-sided conversation
but fine with me.

507
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:33,708
How's Jack doing?

508
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:37,916
Good. I guess.
Well, I have to see him tomorrow.

509
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,083
You have to?

510
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:42,625
Well, it's Tuesday.
Tuesday nights are, uh, family night.

511
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:45,500
So that's what I mean.
I have to go see him 'cause family night.

512
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:48,875
- Don't you want to?
- Well, yeah. He's my husband.

513
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:51,333
- Mmm.
- I leave work every week early

514
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:53,250
just so I can be there on time.

515
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,541
But I think I'd go nuts

516
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:58,041
if I was shut up in that place 24/7, but,

517
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:00,500
he doesn't seem to mind.

518
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,875
So was it Jack's idea
to be admitted to the hospital?

519
00:36:04,958 --> 00:36:05,958
Sort of.

520
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,500
Sort of?

521
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:13,500
- Is this how it works?
- How what works?

522
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:16,416
- This.
- Oh, you think...

523
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,500
No, no, no. If we were doing that,
I'd just say,

524
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:20,750
"Sorry our time is up. Take this pill."

525
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,625
Anyway, we're just talking.

526
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:31,291
You know, sometimes we push people away
just to see if they'll come back.

527
00:36:34,416 --> 00:36:35,500
Yeah?

528
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:38,458
Maybe it'll be better this time.

529
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:40,875
You think?

530
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:42,958
Maybe.

531
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:47,666
You sure it wasn't a blue jay?

532
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:51,083
I... I stitched up a cat once
who'd gone a few rounds with a blue jay.

533
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:53,666
Very aggressive avian, that.

534
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:56,750
Don't think it was a blue jay.
Oh. What's that?

535
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:59,125
- That's a hawk.
- No. It wasn't a hawk.

536
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:00,583
I know what a hawk is.

537
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:03,708
- You know, they used to be dinosaurs.
- Mmm.

538
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:05,083
- Birds did.
- Yeah.

539
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:07,000
You probably knew that
because you're a vet.

540
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:09,208
I knew that even before I was a vet.

541
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:15,916
What happened to your head?

542
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Oh. Just...
There's a bird that thinks I'm a threat.

543
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:20,958
Are you threatening it?

544
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:22,041
No.

545
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:25,583
No, I'm just minding my own business
in the garden.

546
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,500
I don't care what she is.

547
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:31,875
You can tell she don't cook.
She's so skinny.

548
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,750
We got a new recliner.

549
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:36,416
What was wrong with the old one?

550
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:40,708
Nothing. Just thought we needed a change.

551
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:04,291
You gotta be kidding me.

552
00:38:08,541 --> 00:38:09,541
Go on.

553
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:11,916
Get off my owl!

554
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,291
That is a starling.

555
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:33,666
You see the little white flecks
that look like stars?

556
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,750
Very territorial.

557
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:38,833
You won't be able to scare him
away easily. He's too smart for that.

558
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,875
- Smart?
- Oh, they're brilliant.

559
00:38:41,416 --> 00:38:43,875
They're, uh...
extraordinary mimics.

560
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:46,500
Mozart had one as a pet.

561
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:49,083
And, uh, they found in his notebooks

562
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:52,291
a melody from one of his concertos
that he wrote out, and next to it,

563
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:54,666
the melody as the bird sang it,

564
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:58,416
identical,
except for one or two sharps or flats.

565
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,375
Yeah. He was, uh, inconsolable
when the bird died.

566
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:03,833
Even gave it a funeral.

567
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:06,250
There's an idea.

568
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:08,333
Two weeks prior to that,

569
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:11,416
Mozart did not attend
his own father's funeral.

570
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,750
Apparently, his father was an asshole.

571
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:26,291
You the lady with the bird problem?

572
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:28,291
Yeah, that's me.

573
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:30,416
Yeah, well, here are the traps.

574
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,708
This is really more for a coyote.

575
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:35,231
I can't sell you this one.
It's illegal... You have a license?

576
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:36,791
No.

577
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,625
I could rent it to you

578
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:40,750
if you got it back to me first thing.

579
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:47,083
- Oh, no. This is just for a little bird.
- Oh. Well, you could trap it with this.

580
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:50,875
But you better release it in Mexico,
or it's just gonna find its way back.

581
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:53,833
I do not want it to come back.

582
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:56,625
There's only one way to do that.

583
00:39:57,708 --> 00:39:58,708
Remediate.

584
00:40:00,166 --> 00:40:01,708
- You mean...
- Exterminate.

585
00:40:01,791 --> 00:40:02,791
Like...

586
00:40:03,666 --> 00:40:04,666
Like, kill it?

587
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,916
We don't like to use that word.
It's inhumane.

588
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,666
Yeah. Okay, that's...

589
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:13,625
I get... I get that. I mean,
it is what you mean though, right?

590
00:40:13,708 --> 00:40:17,125
There are 400 billion birds
on this planet, lady.

591
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,916
- That seems awfully high.
- It's not.

592
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:24,083
- It seems very high.
- It's not.

593
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:26,333
It's my business.

594
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:28,333
I will tell you this.

595
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:30,500
Lady came in last month.

596
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,000
Glass eye. Bird attacked her.

597
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:36,750
- Oh my God.
- I think it was a sparrow.

598
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:39,500
- You serious?
- Extremely aggressive.

599
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:43,833
Never feel a thing.

600
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:50,041
It's really 400 billion?

601
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:52,333
It's a plague.

602
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,791
What if a raccoon gets at it?

603
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:30,708
Or a cute little bear cub.

604
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,500
Or, like, a baby koala.

605
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:37,625
It's a bird feeder. It's tiny.
Nothing's going to get inside of it.

606
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:40,916
And you know there's no koalas
in North America, right?

607
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,916
Oh yeah. That's true.

608
00:41:44,375 --> 00:41:47,250
I saw a possum shimmy up
a hummingbird water feeder thing one time,

609
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:48,458
a super skinny one.

610
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:52,166
I mean, it was bent like a palm tree
in a tropical storm.

611
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:55,000
Okay. Well, that's not gonna happen here.

612
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:56,750
Probably not, yeah.

613
00:41:56,833 --> 00:41:58,416
It could, though. You know?

614
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,958
Animals will do anything for a snack.
And sugar water...

615
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:03,250
- Have you tried sugar water?
- No, Dickey.

616
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:06,083
I have not tried hummingbird sugar water.

617
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:07,875
It's really sweet.

618
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:11,333
Any animal would go
to great lengths to taste it.

619
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:13,833
Yeah, it's not sugar water. It's seed.

620
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:15,666
Right. Just seed.

621
00:42:16,916 --> 00:42:18,291
Mixed with poison seed.

622
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:23,458
Crap. Now I've gotta go home
and take it down.

623
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,208
I'll clock you out at 5:00.

624
00:43:12,916 --> 00:43:13,916
I'm sorry.

625
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,208
You didn't deserve this.

626
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:31,871
- <i>How are you sleeping?</i>
<i>- Fine.</i>

627
00:43:32,666 --> 00:43:34,666
- Are you eating okay?
- Fine. Yeah.

628
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:40,000
- Are you feeling depressed?
- Okay. We don't have to go through this.

629
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:41,125
We don't...

630
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:46,375
So you're ready to leave?

631
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Believe me,

632
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:50,958
if I thought I could, I would.

633
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:53,291
Even if it meant pretending.

634
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:56,625
But I tried that.
I already tried to do that.

635
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,291
And I ended up here. So what am I...

636
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:03,708
What am I supposed to...
I'm just supposed to go back to work?

637
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:06,791
Do you know what I do for a living?
You know what my job is?

638
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:08,291
Yes. You are a teacher.

639
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:10,250
I'm a grade school art teacher.

640
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:13,333
So...

641
00:44:15,666 --> 00:44:18,291
So you go
and look at those kids every day.

642
00:44:19,416 --> 00:44:20,541
You try doing that.

643
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,791
And what about your wife?
I'm sure she'd like to have you home.

644
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:35,375
You know, a few years back,

645
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:40,166
I joined this Frisbee league.

646
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:41,833
I don't know.

647
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:44,750
And Lilly, my wife,

648
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:46,625
she felt left out,

649
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:50,541
so she insisted that
she become our sole cheerleader.

650
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:54,708
Just to be clear, Frisbee leagues
do not have cheerleaders,

651
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:56,750
or indeed, spectators.

652
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:01,250
But there she'd be with her pom-poms.

653
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,916
I'd make out like I was this jock.

654
00:45:05,416 --> 00:45:09,958
She got me
this letterman jacket.

655
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,583
And we...

656
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:13,791
It was so dumb.

657
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:18,416
I don't know how to get back there.

658
00:45:21,458 --> 00:45:22,833
I can't be

659
00:45:24,166 --> 00:45:25,708
who I was for her.

660
00:45:29,875 --> 00:45:32,458
So, what is your plan?

661
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,708
I just need a minute
to figure out what happens next.

662
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,291
So, if you could just...

663
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:46,791
...write down whatever
you need to write down.

664
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
We can...

665
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:53,208
Can we do that? We just...

666
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:56,166
It's okay then?

667
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:57,833
It's okay for me to stay?

668
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:03,375
I believe that's what's best for now.

669
00:46:18,416 --> 00:46:20,041
Oh!

670
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:25,375
Where are you? Where'd you go?

671
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:28,666
Oh. Yeah.

672
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,750
Didn't expect that, did ya?

673
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:32,541
Look, can we just

674
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:36,333
kind of clear the air, you know,
for the record that I...

675
00:46:36,416 --> 00:46:39,375
I know what you're thinking.
That I killed her...

676
00:46:39,458 --> 00:46:42,125
Remediated that bird, but...

677
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:45,416
I mean, I put that...
Forget it. It doesn't matter why.

678
00:46:46,208 --> 00:46:48,375
I put it out. You know why I put it out.

679
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,125
It was really wrong. It was...

680
00:46:53,291 --> 00:46:54,291
bad.

681
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:56,458
And I shouldn't have done it.

682
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:02,541
I'm dealing with some pretty heavy shit
right now if you couldn't tell.

683
00:47:04,208 --> 00:47:08,583
'Cause everybody's rolling along,
living their lives like nothing happened,

684
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:13,541
you know? And I'm saying, "Stop."
'Cause I wanna get off for a little bit.

685
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:15,583
I mean, it's just...

686
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:19,250
It's pretty weird
me talking to you.

687
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:21,375
Huh?

688
00:47:22,208 --> 00:47:23,416
And you're actually

689
00:47:24,333 --> 00:47:25,375
listening.

690
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,083
Oh, there you go.

691
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,166
Right. Well, good session.

692
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:37,333

The, uh, Naugahyde stains.

710
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:00,208
Yeah. Thanks.

711
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:02,833
How did you find me?

712
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:07,875
Only one "L Fine. DVM" in the directory.

713
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:10,791
- It's a dope rapper name if you ever...
- I don't rap.

714
00:49:14,666 --> 00:49:16,666
I just thought a walk would do me good.

715
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:17,875
In the rain?

716
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:25,541
- How did your visit go last week?
- Great. Swimmingly.

717
00:49:27,541 --> 00:49:31,208
Well, that's good. Thanks for coming by.
It's late. I'm gonna go to bed.

718
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:33,625
I don't know what you want me to say.

719
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
This whole thing,

720
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:41,458
it... it's not about Katie.

721
00:49:42,083 --> 00:49:44,250
You'll talk about her, you know?

722
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:46,791
It's about Jack and you. Jack and you.

723
00:49:46,875 --> 00:49:50,000
How do you restart?
How do you have a marriage, now?

724
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:57,416
Why... Why was Jack admitted
to the hospital?

725
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:00,875
He, um...

726
00:50:04,416 --> 00:50:05,500
He... He was...

727
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:11,333
<i>He hadn't been sleeping well. Um...</i>

728
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:33,583
<i>Yeah, he just wanted to go to sleep</i>

729
00:50:34,458 --> 00:50:35,708
and not wake up.

730
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:37,291
Like Katie.

731
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:42,333
You must've been pretty angry.

732
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,958
I wasn't angry.

733
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:47,333
No, he was depressed.

734
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:49,958
He... He had every reason to be.

735
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:53,708
So did you,
and you didn't try to end your life

736
00:50:53,791 --> 00:50:55,916
and leave your husband behind.

737
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:57,583
Alone.

738
00:51:00,416 --> 00:51:01,750
You blame yourself.

739
00:51:02,541 --> 00:51:04,458
Who's to say anybody's to blame?

740
00:51:04,541 --> 00:51:06,583
- I do.
- Oh, that's shitty, Larry.

741
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:10,541
Not 'cause it's right or wrong, or good
or bad, but because that's what we do.

742
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:16,375
We can't stand the idea of something
so tragic happening for no reason at all.

743
00:51:16,458 --> 00:51:19,333
So... You know, and...
and emotions have to find a way out,

744
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:23,333
and they always do.
So we kick the cat, or we kick the dog,

745
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:24,750
or poison a bird.

746
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,500
And worst of all,

747
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:29,916
we turn on ourselves.

748
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:53,041
Does Jack know how you feel?

749
00:51:57,416 --> 00:51:59,416
Bathroom's down the hall to the left.

750
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:06,208
Talk to him, Lilly.

751
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:09,000
Come on.

752
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,750
Do you like it, being here?

753
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,416
Do I like it?

754
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,208
You know, is it helping?

755
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:34,750
Uh...

756
00:52:35,416 --> 00:52:36,583
Yeah.

757
00:52:36,666 --> 00:52:37,833
Yeah, I... I guess.

758
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:40,791
I thought maybe
we could go up to the lake again,

759
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:43,041
when you get home.
You know, for the Fourth.

760
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:45,875
- Sure. Yeah.
- That's fun, right?

761
00:52:46,541 --> 00:52:49,291
Yeah, it'll be just like it was,
like nothing ever happened.

762
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:51,083
I didn't say that.

763
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:52,166
- No, I know.
- I...

764
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,333
No, but that is why I'm here,
isn't it? I'm...

765
00:52:54,416 --> 00:52:57,333
I'm supposed to just go back
to being my good old self,

766
00:52:57,416 --> 00:52:58,958
and we can all get on with our lives.

767
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:02,017
- It's just gonna take time, that's all.
- Don't, don't, don't. Please.

768
00:53:02,041 --> 00:53:04,541
I mean... You really think

769
00:53:04,625 --> 00:53:07,916
that time is gonna make all of this okay?
It's gonna make us okay?

770
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,958
I'm not saying that. I'm just saying
that we can't stay here like this.

771
00:53:12,041 --> 00:53:13,666
- This is not good.
- I know.

772
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:17,458
But I don't know how I fit anymore.

773
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:21,083
I don't know how we fit,

774
00:53:21,916 --> 00:53:24,208
how any of it works.

775
00:53:24,791 --> 00:53:27,291
I... I'm... I'm just not like you, Lilly.

776
00:53:27,375 --> 00:53:29,041
You're not like me?

777
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:33,375
I carried her inside me for nine months.

778
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,416
So why are you here?

779
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:40,875
- Why did I sleep in that morning?
- Don't do that!

780
00:53:40,958 --> 00:53:43,083
I could've just gone over
and woken her up.

781
00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:44,708
I could've done something.

782
00:53:45,208 --> 00:53:46,916
But I overslept.

783
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:51,791
Every morning, when I wake up,
the first thing I hear is our baby crying.

784
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:54,541
And in that brief moment,

785
00:53:54,625 --> 00:53:56,958
I get to imagine that I just wake up.

786
00:53:58,041 --> 00:53:59,750
Like I always did.

787
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:03,500
That precious moment of agony,

788
00:54:03,583 --> 00:54:05,375
it's the highlight of my day.

789
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:10,083
So please, don't talk to me about time,

790
00:54:11,208 --> 00:54:13,416
because I've got loads of it, Lilly.

791
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:16,791
And I hate it. It never ends.

792
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:19,625
- Honey, please.
- I wish I knew how to stop.

793
00:54:19,708 --> 00:54:22,000
I wish. I don't.

794
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:27,291
I got rid of all her things.

795
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:34,250
I didn't know what to do.

796
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:38,250
I just kept staring at her closed door.

797
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,500
I got rid of all of her things.

798
00:54:43,375 --> 00:54:44,625
I just couldn't.

799
00:54:44,708 --> 00:54:47,041
- I just wanted...
- You should go, I think.

800
00:54:47,125 --> 00:54:48,684
- I'm sorry, I...
- No, I think...

801
00:54:48,708 --> 00:54:50,791
I don't know why I did it. I...

802
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:52,541
I should've asked you.

803
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Jack?

804
00:54:58,458 --> 00:54:59,458
Jack!

805
00:55:08,916 --> 00:55:10,708
<i>You made me a lunch?</i>

806
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:12,250
What do we have here?

807
00:55:14,166 --> 00:55:17,000
- What?
- My mother used to put those in my lunch.

808
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:20,250
<i>♪ Hostess
'Cause I love you the mostess ♪</i>

809
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:23,083
<i> ♪ Tell me this, tell me now ♪</i>

810
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:24,666
<i>♪ When's it gonna be ♪</i>

811
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:28,125
<i>♪ My time to be loved actually ♪</i>

812
00:55:57,125 --> 00:55:59,892
- That's good. Maybe toward me.
- She's doing it again.

813
00:55:59,916 --> 00:56:02,958
Poor thing.
She's not doing well.

814
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:08,500
I don't know.
Maybe it's in the wrong aisle.

815
00:56:45,458 --> 00:56:46,500
Lilly.

816
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:49,958
They wouldn't buzz me in. I was starting
to think something was wrong. Is he okay?

817
00:56:50,041 --> 00:56:51,250
Why don't we sit down?

818
00:56:51,333 --> 00:56:52,434
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.

819
00:56:52,458 --> 00:56:55,000
He's good. Fine. It's just that, um...

820
00:56:55,958 --> 00:56:59,125
- Why don't we sit down?
- I don't want to. I wanna talk to Jack.

821
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,833
Actually, he's requested to not see
any visitors for a while.

822
00:57:06,666 --> 00:57:09,625
I'm not a v... visitor. I'm his wife.

823
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:12,250
It's not unusual
for a patient to want some space.

824
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:15,916
Space? Uh, I drive an hour
both ways to get here.

825
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
- That's all the space he gets.
- Legally, he has the right.

826
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:22,083
- Legally, I don't give a shit.
- Lilly, please, sit down. That's it.

827
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:25,666
Fine! God! There!
It's all better now that we're seated.

828
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:28,333
Did you look up
that old colleague of mine?

829
00:57:28,416 --> 00:57:31,333
Yes. And maybe you could've mentioned
that he also treats poodles.

830
00:57:31,916 --> 00:57:33,125
He'd never tell you this,

831
00:57:33,208 --> 00:57:35,875
but Larry was on track to run
the whole show at Johns Hopkins.

832
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:37,458
Yeah, but he didn't, did he?

833
00:57:38,541 --> 00:57:40,916
So he's a quitter like everybody else.

834
00:57:43,166 --> 00:57:46,541
When do you think
I will be able to see Jack?

835
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,208
I don't know.

836
00:57:49,291 --> 00:57:50,625
That's up to Jack.

837
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:57,083
You know what?

838
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:00,375
Here. Give him that.

839
00:58:02,708 --> 00:58:04,708
I drove an hour. That's what I do.

840
00:58:04,791 --> 00:58:05,958
For us.

841
00:58:06,041 --> 00:58:07,375
And you don't wanna see me.

842
00:58:07,458 --> 00:58:09,875
You think I like driving an hour here
and an hour back?

843
00:58:10,375 --> 00:58:11,375
Yeah?

844
00:58:17,375 --> 00:58:19,333
I get it.

845
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:21,166
I mean, you want your space.

846
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:25,625
You want space? I'll give you space.
I'll give you an-hour-both-ways space.

847
00:58:27,166 --> 00:58:31,000
You never ever thought
about what I did, did you?

848
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:32,166
Not once!

849
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,291
Not even once!

850
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:37,458
I feel shit too, Jack!

851
00:58:40,125 --> 00:58:42,625
You don't wanna see me?
You know what? I don't wanna see you!

852
00:58:43,375 --> 00:58:45,041
I don't wanna see you either!

853
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:48,000
Did you ever once think about that,
that I don't wanna see you?

854
00:58:49,041 --> 00:58:50,625
Get another visitor!

855
00:58:55,208 --> 00:58:56,291
Jack?

856
00:58:56,375 --> 00:58:58,083
Jack.

857
00:59:17,125 --> 00:59:22,583
Oh my God.
Oh God, what do you...

858
00:59:22,666 --> 00:59:24,666
Shh shh. I can't... I can't hear the cat.

859
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:27,625
What... It's murmuring?
Can you hear a murmur?

860
00:59:27,708 --> 00:59:30,500
All I hear is a grown man wailing. Shh.

861
00:59:33,583 --> 00:59:35,291
Okay, here's the deal.

862
00:59:35,375 --> 00:59:36,541
What?

863
00:59:36,625 --> 00:59:39,916
Give him his medicine.
Twice a day, with food.

864
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,666
And no more truck-stop food.
Dry food only.

865
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,833
- Okay?
- Okay, I got it.

866
00:59:44,916 --> 00:59:45,833
I mean it.

867
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:49,541
Okay, I will tell him.
Hey. Hey, you hear that?

868
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:51,916
Hey, hey, no more nachos.

869
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,833
No more corn bread. Huh?

870
00:59:53,916 --> 00:59:56,333
No more corn dogs.
And no more Cheetos.

871
00:59:56,416 --> 01:00:00,416
Don't look at me like that.
Why are you looking at me?

872
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:06,625
- Your mom really isn't here?
- She's coming back to get me later.

873
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:08,791
Yeah, well, let's wait for her, okay?

874
01:00:08,875 --> 01:00:11,708
I know what you're gonna say.
She gets tired all the time.

875
01:00:12,333 --> 01:00:14,750
My brother says she's getting skinny too.

876
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:17,250
See, it's, uh...

877
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,583
She's in a lot of pain,

878
01:00:20,625 --> 01:00:22,916
and the quality of her life is...
is... is going to...

879
01:00:23,416 --> 01:00:26,791
I'm talking about the quality of her life.
I'm talking about the quality of life

880
01:00:26,875 --> 01:00:29,666
to a ten-year-old.
Did Howie's mom not say anything about...

881
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,500
I told you. She signed off on it.
She's coming back later.

882
01:00:32,583 --> 01:00:34,416
- Okay?
- It's not her fault.

883
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:37,125
She's not good with these things.

884
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,708
Are you sure there's nothing?

885
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:47,083
I'm sure.

886
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,500
It's okay.

887
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:05,708
You've got to stop
with the just-showing-up business.

888
01:01:05,791 --> 01:01:07,750
I need a favor, Larry.

889
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,458
He won't see me,
and they won't even let me talk to him.

890
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:12,458
- Well, that's within his rights.
- So I hear.

891
01:01:12,541 --> 01:01:15,500
But I... I... I was thinking that
you could call Regina or someone.

892
01:01:15,583 --> 01:01:16,500
Doesn't work that way.

893
01:01:16,583 --> 01:01:19,208
But you know how it does work,
and you must have some...

894
01:01:19,291 --> 01:01:21,166
some kind of credentials still, right?

895
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:24,083
- This isn't the best time, Lilly.
- Well, no shit, Larry.

896
01:01:24,166 --> 01:01:28,333
I've been scratched off the guest list
in a mental hospital by my own husband.

897
01:01:28,416 --> 01:01:30,958
Here's what you do.

898
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:33,250
Go and talk to Fawn
and make an appointment.

899
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:34,375
Make an appointment?

900
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:37,541
Aren't you supposed to be helping me?
Isn't that what this is?

901
01:01:38,083 --> 01:01:40,750
Non-therapy therapy,

902
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:44,041
pretend therapy, whatever?
Isn't that what we've been doing?

903
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:48,125
- What, am I on this island all alone?
- I'm not a therapist anymore.

904
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:50,750
And I am certainly not your therapist.

905
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,750
You got that right.

906
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:55,166
Because you're a shit one.

907
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,416
Maybe that's why you quit.

908
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,833
I mean, what is it that makes

909
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:01,833
this so much better, huh?

910
01:02:01,916 --> 01:02:04,416
'Cause wha... Is it 'cause
cats don't talk back?

911
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:09,625
No, they don't.
They do, however, make appointments.

912
01:02:11,458 --> 01:02:13,541
What do you want from me?

913
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:16,458
You... You want some kind of answer?

914
01:02:16,541 --> 01:02:18,583
You want me to say
everything's gonna be okay?

915
01:02:18,666 --> 01:02:19,666
Yeah.

916
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:21,291
Yeah, Larry. I...

917
01:02:21,791 --> 01:02:24,500
Answers are good. People want answers.

918
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:26,291
I don't have the answers.

919
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,625
I never did. I just talked.

920
01:02:29,708 --> 01:02:33,291
And the moment I figured that out,
I quit and stopped pretending.

921
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:37,166
You think you can fix Jack?
You think that's the solution?

922
01:02:39,916 --> 01:02:41,416
What am I supposed to do?

923
01:02:42,666 --> 01:02:44,000
I'm supposed to quit?

924
01:02:44,791 --> 01:02:45,833
Like him?

925
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Or like you?

926
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:52,125
At least quitting is an active choice.

927
01:02:53,041 --> 01:02:54,041
Why don't we quit?

928
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:56,208
I'm so sorry.
I never should've started this.

929
01:02:56,291 --> 01:02:57,291
It's my fault.

930
01:02:57,833 --> 01:03:01,375
Let's just agree
to not do this anymore, okay?

931
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:08,250
Sure thing, Larry.

932
01:03:49,583 --> 01:03:50,625
Ow!

933
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:57,416
You son of a bitch!

934
01:04:01,125 --> 01:04:02,416
Ow!

935
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:11,583
Okay, you little shit.
Here comes the pain.

936
01:04:13,666 --> 01:04:16,041
Ow! God!

937
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:25,541
Ha!

938
01:04:52,791 --> 01:04:53,833
Oh God.

939
01:05:01,458 --> 01:05:02,708
<i> Oh, Lilly.</i>

940
01:05:11,625 --> 01:05:12,833
Hi, Jack.

941
01:05:14,625 --> 01:05:19,000
<i>Being there for others
is exactly the answer I was searching for.</i>

942
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:22,041
<i>You reach out to someone today.</i>

943
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:23,565
<i>Pastor, I can tell you</i>

944
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:27,000
<i>that you made a difference in my life
when you reached out to me.</i>

945
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,875
<i>When I found the good word, I was...</i>

946
01:05:30,958 --> 01:05:33,375
<i>I was lost. I was broken.</i>

947
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:35,708
<i>Addicted.</i>

948
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,500
<i>Sleeping around.</i>

949
01:05:37,541 --> 01:05:39,625
- Ow.
<i>- I'm not proud of it.</i>

950
01:05:39,708 --> 01:05:42,791
<i>Reminds me of Ephesians 6:7.</i>

951
01:05:42,875 --> 01:05:43,958
<i>- "With good will..."</i>
- Ow.

952
01:05:44,041 --> 01:05:47,000
<i>"...doing service
as to the Lord and not to men."</i>

953
01:05:47,083 --> 01:05:50,500
<i>Not to men. Amen.
Not to men. That's the journey.</i>

954
01:05:50,583 --> 01:05:52,708
<i>That was
the takeaway for me.</i>

955
01:05:53,708 --> 01:05:55,958
<i>Because there were so many men.</i>

956
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,833
<i>So many men.</i>  <i>A lot of men.

957
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,333
Pretend you're a tiger.

958
01:06:03,875 --> 01:06:05,000
Chase your tail.

959
01:06:05,583 --> 01:06:07,625
- Whoa, I'm dizzy!
- Now, sit up.

960
01:06:07,708 --> 01:06:09,958
Good tiger, good tiger.

961
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:11,125
Now let's roar.

962
01:06:11,208 --> 01:06:12,125
Roar!

963
01:06:12,208 --> 01:06:14,375
Down, tiger. Good boy.

964
01:06:15,375 --> 01:06:17,125
- This is fun.
- Keep going.

965
01:06:17,708 --> 01:06:18,708
Sit up.

966
01:06:19,083 --> 01:06:20,833
Spin around.

967
01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:22,333
Now roar.

968
01:06:22,416 --> 01:06:23,250
Roar!

969
01:06:23,333 --> 01:06:25,083
- Louder.
- Roar!

970
01:06:25,166 --> 01:06:26,166
Again, again!

971
01:06:27,458 --> 01:06:28,708
Roar!

972
01:06:28,791 --> 01:06:31,583
- Good tiger. Good boy.
- Hey, I wanna play.

973
01:06:31,666 --> 01:06:32,916
- Can I play?
- Okay.

974
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,500
- I'm the lion tamer.
- Oh, and a good one.

975
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:37,583
How about I'm... I'm just another lion?

976
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:40,875
- I'm a tiger.
- Oh, you're a tiger!

977
01:06:40,958 --> 01:06:42,583
Do you... Do you have a roar?

978
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:43,666
- Roar!
- Oh!

979
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,416
You frightened the life out of me.
That was really good.

980
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,720
Well, if we're a circus, we're gonna need
some more animals, I think.

981
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:52,291
Uh, I spy a giraffe.

982
01:06:53,458 --> 01:06:56,708
Hey, Mel. You're a giraffe.
Come on. You're a giraffe.

983
01:06:56,791 --> 01:06:58,059
- I'm giraffe?
- Yeah.

984
01:06:58,083 --> 01:07:00,041
- All right, I'm a giraffe.
- You're a giraffe.

985
01:07:00,125 --> 01:07:01,791
Okay, we've got our giraffe.

986
01:07:01,875 --> 01:07:03,625
Oh! Who's that playing in the mud?

987
01:07:03,708 --> 01:07:06,583
I found our elephant!
We need an elephant, don't we?

988
01:07:06,666 --> 01:07:09,625
Bob, you're gonna be an elephant.
Can you do it?

989
01:07:09,708 --> 01:07:11,291
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's it.

990
01:07:11,375 --> 01:07:12,875
All right, everybody.

991
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:14,392
- Come on, giraffe.
- All right.

992
01:07:14,416 --> 01:07:17,166
We've got our lion tamer
to tell us what to do, okay?

993
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:18,541
Can we do the sounds.

994
01:07:18,625 --> 01:07:20,425
What's the sound?
What is the sound like, Bob?

995
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:26,666
That's it!

996
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:32,041
How about our tiger?

997
01:07:32,125 --> 01:07:35,333
Young lion tamer, what is thy command?

998
01:07:35,416 --> 01:07:38,291
Roar! Roar!

999
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:41,291
- I don't wanna play.
- Sweetheart. It's okay.

1000
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:44,333
No, it's okay. I was only...
I was only playing.

1001
01:07:44,416 --> 01:07:46,458
Hey, listen,
why don't we do a parade instead...

1002
01:07:46,541 --> 01:07:48,541
- I wanna go now.
- Okay, Jack.

1003
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:50,708
- Oh, I was just... Oh, look!
- That was fun.

1004
01:07:50,791 --> 01:07:53,458
Here come the clowns.
You wanna be in the parade band?

1005
01:07:53,541 --> 01:07:55,333
- Come on, everyone.
- Hold on.

1006
01:07:55,416 --> 01:07:56,708
- Hey!
- Come on.

1007
01:07:56,791 --> 01:07:57,875
What's, um...

1008
01:07:57,958 --> 01:07:59,208
All right, that's it.

1009
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:01,125
- Where'd my giraffe go?
- Jack?

1010
01:08:01,208 --> 01:08:04,416
- What do you say you go inside?
- Mel, what's going on?

1011
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,500
- Don't touch me.
- You're scaring people.

1012
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,892
- What do you say you go inside?
- I don't wanna go inside.

1013
01:08:08,916 --> 01:08:10,416
- Okay, Jack...
- I don't wanna go in!

1014
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:11,500
Jack!

1015
01:08:11,541 --> 01:08:13,301
- Sorry.
- Ow. I'm all right.

1016
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:14,750
Get off!

1017
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:16,250
Okay. I don't wanna go in.

1018
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:18,208
Regina, I don't want to go inside.

1019
01:08:18,291 --> 01:08:20,458
I wanna play outside.
We were just playing.

1020
01:08:20,541 --> 01:08:22,000
I don't wanna go back.

1021
01:08:22,083 --> 01:08:24,125
Oh my God, this is crazy.

1022
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:39,875
<i>Uh, can I get
a price check on register two?</i>

1023
01:08:43,416 --> 01:08:46,583
<i>Uh,</i> <i>need a price check
on register four.</i>

1024
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:49,541
- <i> Y'ello.</i>
- Hey.

1025
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:53,208
We need another checker
on four, and three, and two.

1026
01:08:57,916 --> 01:09:00,625
<i>Travis, to the front, please.</i>

1027
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:01,708
Lilly.

1028
01:09:02,208 --> 01:09:03,333
What the hell are you doing?

1029
01:09:03,416 --> 01:09:05,958
Doing the price changes
that you asked me to do.

1030
01:09:06,583 --> 01:09:09,791
Since when do we charge a nickel

1031
01:09:09,875 --> 01:09:12,083
for a package
of feminine hygiene products?

1032
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:17,166
Or a bag of crispy fish fry?

1033
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:19,916
Or just about every other damn item
in the store?

1034
01:09:20,916 --> 01:09:23,083
Well, I don't... I don't know. I mean, that...

1035
01:09:24,041 --> 01:09:25,541
That can't... it can't be right.

1036
01:09:25,625 --> 01:09:29,500
What color is the sky
in your world, Kemosabe?

1037
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:32,041
<i>We need a price check
in the bakery.</i>

1038
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:34,916
Maybe I should... I should just
start changing these back

1039
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,666
before people start to get the wrong idea.

1040
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:40,791
It's all five cents over here!

1041
01:09:42,666 --> 01:09:44,291
Or maybe I should take a break.

1042
01:09:44,375 --> 01:09:46,291
Just take the rest of the day off, sister.

1043
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:49,541
You're gonna have to earn this back.

1044
01:09:50,125 --> 01:09:51,875
Thin ice, Lilly. Thin ice.

1045
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:56,083
Sir, sir, nothing in the store
is five cents. Nothing.

1073
01:12:04,041 --> 01:12:07,375
<i>such as a starling, is that people
begin to take it personally.</i>

1074
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:12,166
<i>I... I don't think the laws of nature
are intrinsically right or wrong,</i>

1075
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:16,166
until you're faced with something
that's just so...

1076
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:20,291
inexplicable, so randomly cruel.

1077
01:12:21,041 --> 01:12:22,625
And you...

1078
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:25,250
...try to find a reason for it.

1079
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:26,833
And when you can't find any,

1080
01:12:26,916 --> 01:12:30,833
I... I guess that's when
it starts to get pretty personal.

1081
01:12:35,375 --> 01:12:37,750
And she came to see you about the bird?

1082
01:12:38,708 --> 01:12:40,958
Well, yes, uh, technically.

1083
01:12:41,041 --> 01:12:45,458
And now you're here
to talk to me about the bird?

1084
01:12:46,041 --> 01:12:47,708
Not... Not...

1085
01:12:49,541 --> 01:12:53,250
per se. Um, I'm here to ask you,
in fact, to...

1086
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:56,875
just talk to Lilly.

1087
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:01,708
I... I don't think it's your intention
to punish her.

1088
01:13:03,708 --> 01:13:06,791
No, no. It is only my intention
to punish myself.

1089
01:13:11,958 --> 01:13:14,625
- Did she tell you why I'm here?
- Yes.

1090
01:13:19,875 --> 01:13:21,791
So she came to you for help

1091
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:24,583
because... because you're her shrink,

1092
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:26,791
but in a vet form.

1093
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:29,875
She...

1094
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,041
Okay.

1095
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:33,708
She came

1096
01:13:34,291 --> 01:13:35,333
to talk.

1097
01:13:37,166 --> 01:13:39,791
And I'm afraid I just didn't do
a very good job of that.

1098
01:13:42,125 --> 01:13:43,333
Then why are you here?

1099
01:13:43,416 --> 01:13:44,916
I told you.

1100
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,500
- So that you would... I... I'm asking you...
- Oh, you're here for yourself.

1101
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:51,250
Yes. Okay.

1102
01:13:54,708 --> 01:13:57,333
You came here to make you feel better.

1103
01:13:57,916 --> 01:13:59,958
Well, you did it. We talked.

1104
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:01,041
So...

1105
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:04,791
feel better.

1106
01:14:15,041 --> 01:14:16,250
You want a beer?

1107
01:14:16,833 --> 01:14:19,541
- I know I could use one.
- Thanks, man.

1108
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:22,666
This place is really nice.

1109
01:14:23,833 --> 01:14:25,458
Yeah, it was my grandpa's.

1110
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,500
It's a bitch to mow.

1111
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,750
- Is that the one?
- Yep, that's him.

1112
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:35,208
- He looks pretty harmless.
- Oh, don't let it fool you.

1113
01:14:35,833 --> 01:14:37,250
You can't do anything about it?

1114
01:14:37,833 --> 01:14:40,250
Some things are just out of our control.

1115
01:14:41,416 --> 01:14:43,916
And the sooner you figure out
what they are,

1116
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,291
the faster you can let them go.

1117
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,083
Look at that. You got a philosophy.

1118
01:14:57,291 --> 01:14:59,500
Little guy's coming this way.
Oh, shit, shit!

1119
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:02,833
Holy shit! That bird's crazy!

1120
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,416
It's coming back. He's circling around.

1121
01:15:06,791 --> 01:15:09,166
Yeah, yeah, yeah, throw it. Throw it!

1122
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:11,750
Whoa!

1123
01:15:11,833 --> 01:15:14,291
- Oh shit!
- Nice shot, Mrs. M!

1124
01:15:14,375 --> 01:15:17,416
- Shit! What did you do, Lilly?
- Oh, you nailed it, man.

1125
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,260
- That was awesome.
- No, no, no, no.

1126
01:15:20,291 --> 01:15:22,041
- Go get me something.
- Okay.

1127
01:15:23,041 --> 01:15:25,416
- Wait, what am I getting?
- Like a towel or something.

1128
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:28,291
- Okay. Where do you keep...
- Dickey, just get a towel!

1129
01:15:28,375 --> 01:15:29,541
Just get it? Got it.

1130
01:15:37,625 --> 01:15:39,250
It's in shock. It's suffocating.

1131
01:15:39,333 --> 01:15:41,333
This is the best I could do
on short notice.

1132
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:44,750
- Avian anatomy's not our specialty.
- That looks like a hummingbird.

1133
01:15:44,833 --> 01:15:48,291
- They're all the same.
- Yeah, it's the anterior air sac.

1134
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:50,791
But I don't know how I can get in there.
Uh, I don't know.

1135
01:15:50,875 --> 01:15:53,125
- Uh, where's my bird box?
- You don't have a bird box.

1136
01:15:53,208 --> 01:15:55,125
Yes, we do.
It's got all the right instruments.

1137
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:58,250
- Great. It's a vet without a bird box.
- Will you wait outside?

1138
01:15:58,333 --> 01:15:59,875
- No.
- What about a coffee stir straw?

1139
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:02,125
- Good idea.
- Have you not done this before?

1140
01:16:02,208 --> 01:16:03,541
No, I haven't. Have you?

1141
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:06,041
- You wanna wait for a specialist?
- Is that an option?

1142
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:08,208
I'd love to,
cause you're talking coffee stir straws.

1143
01:16:08,291 --> 01:16:10,642
- Could you wait outside, Lilly?
- No! I won't wait outside!

1144
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:12,416
- Out, out, out!
- Go, please.

1145
01:16:12,958 --> 01:16:14,750
- What do you need?
- Uh...

1146
01:16:14,833 --> 01:16:19,083
Well, uh, surgical soap,
sterile drape, and, uh, vodka.

1147
01:16:19,166 --> 01:16:20,208
Vodka?

1148
01:16:20,791 --> 01:16:22,208
Oh, for you.

1149
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:24,750
- We have a bottle of gin.
- That'll do.

1150
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:38,500
Jack?

1151
01:19:02,208 --> 01:19:06,416
Tonight, I'd like to talk about
the importance of being honest.

1152
01:19:07,041 --> 01:19:08,333
With ourselves.

1153
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,625
Velma, would you like to start?

1154
01:19:11,666 --> 01:19:14,458
- I'm sick of all the damn talkin'.
- Okay.

1155
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:15,833
That was honest.

1156
01:19:15,916 --> 01:19:16,916
I'll go.

1157
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:19,916
If, uh, if that's okay.

1158
01:19:21,166 --> 01:19:22,708
Yes, of course.

1159
01:19:27,041 --> 01:19:28,041
Um...

1160
01:19:34,041 --> 01:19:36,166
I'm depressed. That's why I'm here.

1161
01:19:46,458 --> 01:19:49,333
Um, my little girl passed away.

1162
01:19:50,541 --> 01:19:53,833
And then I tried to pass myself away.

1163
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:58,708
That's not funny.
But that is what I tried to do.

1164
01:19:59,458 --> 01:20:02,833
And I thought it was because of Katie.
Uh, that was my...

1165
01:20:04,541 --> 01:20:06,666
That is my daughter's name. Katie.

1166
01:20:09,458 --> 01:20:11,958
But if I'm being honest with myself,

1167
01:20:12,041 --> 01:20:15,583
I have been in and out of this state
since I was in my 20s.

1168
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:19,416
And I don't know how to get out of it.

1169
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
I, um...

1170
01:20:22,916 --> 01:20:26,000
I've been to therapists.
I've taken the medication.

1171
01:20:26,583 --> 01:20:30,041
And sometimes, it works.
It does feel a bit better.

1172
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:31,625
And then after a while,

1173
01:20:33,291 --> 01:20:34,291
I quit.

1174
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:40,583
Because I don't need that shit.

1175
01:20:40,666 --> 01:20:46,666
Because...
I can deal with my own life.

1176
01:20:50,791 --> 01:20:53,750
Quit on myself so fast.

1177
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:57,750
And then I quit on the people who love me.

1178
01:20:58,666 --> 01:21:00,958
I mean, my wife.

1179
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:03,500
"My wife."

1180
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:09,208
My wife wouldn't know how to quit.

1181
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:13,916
Wouldn't know where to start.

1182
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:15,833
She just keeps at it.

1183
01:21:15,916 --> 01:21:18,833
Just keeps hoping and believing

1184
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:22,750
and moving around in the world.
And I hate her for it.

1185
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:30,208
And I love her so much for it
at the same time.

1186
01:21:32,833 --> 01:21:33,833
So much that...

1187
01:21:35,583 --> 01:21:38,416
I wanna not quit with her.

1188
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:42,125
Not <i>for</i> her.

1189
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:47,916
I wanna not quit with her.

1190
01:21:58,583 --> 01:22:00,166
Yeah, so that's my day.

1191
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:02,291
Um...

1192
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:05,916
a happy day.

1193
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:13,916
Jack.

1194
01:22:15,083 --> 01:22:16,583
You asshole.

1195
01:22:17,708 --> 01:22:18,708
Tissue.

1196
01:22:19,833 --> 01:22:20,833
I know.

1197
01:22:22,083 --> 01:22:24,333
Thanks for sharing, Jack.

1198
01:22:29,041 --> 01:22:32,333
Might as well take him home. There's
no point in staying here all night.

1199
01:22:32,416 --> 01:22:33,250
What do I do?

1200
01:22:33,333 --> 01:22:36,458
Uh, just try to get a couple drops of this

1201
01:22:36,541 --> 01:22:39,625
into his throat
every couple of hours if you can.

1202
01:22:39,708 --> 01:22:40,625
Will he wake up?

1203
01:22:43,416 --> 01:22:44,666
It's hard to say.

1204
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:49,500
- What's on his wings?
- They're bound so he can't fly away.

1205
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,583
You know, even if he does wake up,
I... I might still have to...

1206
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:59,083
If the wound doesn't heal,
he won't be able to protect himself.

1207
01:22:59,166 --> 01:23:01,125
It wouldn't be fair to send him out there...

1208
01:23:01,208 --> 01:23:03,458
...like this on his own.

1209
01:23:05,125 --> 01:23:06,125
Huh.

1210
01:23:06,916 --> 01:23:08,291
Funny how that works.

1211
01:23:08,875 --> 01:23:10,208
How what works?

1212
01:23:10,291 --> 01:23:12,833
Oh, just the idea of this little guy
trying to survive

1213
01:23:12,916 --> 01:23:15,333
out there in the cruel world
all by himself.

1214
01:23:16,833 --> 01:23:19,250
Starlings are different than other birds.

1215
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:22,625
When they mate,
they... they build a nest together,

1216
01:23:22,708 --> 01:23:24,458
and they protect the nest.

1217
01:23:25,041 --> 01:23:26,041
Together.

1218
01:23:26,583 --> 01:23:28,875
They even feed the hatchlings together.

1219
01:23:29,458 --> 01:23:33,541
They're just not meant to exist
in the world alone,

1220
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:35,791
on their own.

1221
01:23:39,791 --> 01:23:41,500
Real subtle stuff, Larry.

1222
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,125
I thought so.

1223
01:23:53,708 --> 01:23:55,458
Okay, that's enough.

1224
01:23:56,333 --> 01:23:57,333
Okay.

1225
01:23:57,958 --> 01:23:59,208
Maybe just a little.

1226
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:11,666
You know you like this.

1227
01:24:25,916 --> 01:24:29,500
I read that if you talk to somebody
in a coma, it can help them heal faster.

1228
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:38,208
Come on. Come on.

1229
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Hello?

1230
01:24:50,916 --> 01:24:53,500
<i>I'm a little busy here, Jack,</i>

1231
01:24:53,583 --> 01:24:56,666
<i>so I don't really have time to listen
to you breathe.</i>

1232
01:24:57,291 --> 01:25:00,208
You know that you're not the only one
in pain, right?

1233
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:04,791
I mean, ever since Katie left us,
it's been...

1234
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:07,375
And then you did what you did.

1235
01:25:07,458 --> 01:25:09,416
Which is not okay, Jack.

1236
01:25:10,125 --> 01:25:13,916
<i>I've been holding down
the fort for a year and...</i>

1237
01:25:14,708 --> 01:25:16,041
I haven't had five minutes

1238
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:18,541
to think about my own feelings.

1239
01:25:18,625 --> 01:25:20,708
We never seem to
get around to that, right?

1240
01:25:20,791 --> 01:25:24,000
<i>Which is pretty fucking selfish,
isn't it, Jack?</i>

1241
01:25:24,083 --> 01:25:26,958
<i>So when you get back, shit's gonna change.</i>

1242
01:25:27,041 --> 01:25:28,333
Things are gonna be said,

1243
01:25:28,416 --> 01:25:29,625
tears are gonna be shed,

1244
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:33,250
and then we're gonna move on and move up.

1245
01:25:33,333 --> 01:25:35,708
And we're gonna find a different

1246
01:25:35,791 --> 01:25:38,416
but even better life than the one we had

1247
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:42,583
because I am not interested
in some kind of lateral move.

1248
01:25:45,583 --> 01:25:49,916
And you're gonna say sorry
to me for trying to take you from me.

1249
01:25:53,875 --> 01:25:56,000
You're gonna say it every day.

1250
01:25:56,083 --> 01:25:58,267
You're gonna say it every day
for the rest of our lives.

1251
01:25:58,291 --> 01:26:00,875
That's gonna be a very long, long time.

1252
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:04,375
<i>'Cause we're gonna live a long life, Jack.</i>

1253
01:26:04,458 --> 01:26:06,500
<i>And we're gonna do it together.</i>

1254
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:14,166
So I'm gonna hang up on you now,
because that'd make us even-steven...

1255
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:16,708
...'cause you hung up on me, so...

1256
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:20,125
Besides, I've gotta go feed...

1257
01:26:20,625 --> 01:26:22,958
...a bird that I tried to kill.

1258
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:56,916
<i>Can you understand?</i>

1259
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,125
You're married, right? I mean,
I'm assuming you're married.

1260
01:27:00,208 --> 01:27:03,041
At least, are monogamous?

1261
01:27:03,125 --> 01:27:04,291
At least? I don't know.

1262
01:27:04,375 --> 01:27:06,916
Are birds monogamous?

1263
01:27:12,333 --> 01:27:14,041
I don't know how that works.

1264
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:19,500
Here's your tube.

1265
01:27:20,125 --> 01:27:21,291
Come on. Come on.

1266
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:29,708
Excellent, Sarah. Watch your fingers.

1267
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:36,916
Oh! Looks like the picture. Very nice.

1268
01:27:40,416 --> 01:27:42,250
Velma, what do we have here?

1269
01:27:42,333 --> 01:27:43,791
See? You got the switch.

1270
01:27:43,875 --> 01:27:45,809
- Uh-huh.
- It goes right in there.

1271
01:27:45,833 --> 01:27:47,875
You turn it on, and it stays up.

1272
01:27:49,541 --> 01:27:52,708
- Yes! Up!
- Ooh, it's, yes, creative.

1273
01:28:03,375 --> 01:28:04,583
I think, um,

1274
01:28:04,666 --> 01:28:06,166
you forgot something?

1275
01:28:07,125 --> 01:28:09,833
- The hole? For the...
- Oh! Yeah.

1276
01:28:12,583 --> 01:28:13,916
Can I just leave it?

1277
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:15,916
How would it work?

1278
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:18,875
Does it have to work?

1279
01:28:22,041 --> 01:28:23,125
No, I guess not.

1280
01:28:24,625 --> 01:28:25,625
It's lovely.

1281
01:28:27,541 --> 01:28:28,541
Thank you.

1282
01:28:32,208 --> 01:28:33,500
Good-lookin' tree.

1283
01:28:45,208 --> 01:28:47,583
- How are you sleeping?
- Fine.

1284
01:28:48,083 --> 01:28:49,916
And how are you feeling?

1285
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:53,583
- You are a creature of habit.
- So you're feeling good.

1286
01:28:54,083 --> 01:28:55,625
Yes, I am.

1287
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:02,500
But what if I stop feeling good?
What if it doesn't last?

1288
01:29:02,583 --> 01:29:04,291
That's a possibility.

1289
01:29:07,166 --> 01:29:10,458
Can I just say I found our time together
fairly unhelpful overall?

1290
01:29:10,541 --> 01:29:12,291
But you've made progress.

1291
01:29:12,375 --> 01:29:13,291
I have.

1292
01:29:13,375 --> 01:29:16,166
I just don't know
if it was because of you.

1293
01:29:19,791 --> 01:29:22,166
There will be good days
and there will be bad days, Jack.

1294
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:23,791
Gonna miss these gems.

1295
01:29:24,458 --> 01:29:26,791
Living is predictable in that way.

1296
01:29:26,875 --> 01:29:28,125
Embrace routine.

1297
01:29:29,458 --> 01:29:30,541
It's good for you.

1298
01:29:31,541 --> 01:29:33,750
Ah yeah, the routine of living.

1299
01:29:33,833 --> 01:29:35,791
Make dinner, go to bed, wake up,

1300
01:29:35,875 --> 01:29:38,041
make your bed, kiss your wife.

1301
01:29:38,125 --> 01:29:41,583
But eventually, you'll go back to work.
You'll be around children again.

1302
01:29:42,583 --> 01:29:44,666
Maybe you can start planting
in your garden.

1303
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:45,833
And one day,

1304
01:29:45,916 --> 01:29:48,958
you will say your daughter's name
without thinking about it.

1305
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:51,666
It will just slip out

1306
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:54,500
in remembrance and not in anguish.

1307
01:29:56,333 --> 01:29:57,583
And that'll be that.

1308
01:30:07,833 --> 01:30:10,333
- That was actually pretty good.
- Thank you.

1309
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:14,583
Maybe there's hope for you yet.

1310
01:30:31,791 --> 01:30:33,583
Wow, hello.

1311
01:30:34,958 --> 01:30:37,583
Don't, don't, don't, don't do that.

1312
01:31:02,375 --> 01:31:04,250
I am gonna pick you up.

1313
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:11,708
It's okay.

1314
01:31:13,541 --> 01:31:16,125
There we go.

1315
01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:24,791
I'm not afraid of you.

1316
01:31:25,541 --> 01:31:27,166
You're very small.

1317
01:31:28,833 --> 01:31:31,166
My helmet is very close too.

1318
01:31:32,916 --> 01:31:34,750
I'm gonna take you outside.

1319
01:31:56,958 --> 01:31:59,041
I think he was wrong about you.

1320
01:32:00,666 --> 01:32:02,125
Maybe I was too.

1321
01:32:16,583 --> 01:32:18,958
Okay. Come on. Fly, fly.

1322
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:24,791
Come on, fly. Please go.

1323
01:32:24,875 --> 01:32:26,125
Go, go, go, go!

1324
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:29,250
Fly, fly, fly, come on, fly!

1325
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,458
Fly! There you go!

1326
01:32:32,041 --> 01:32:34,500
There you go, you son of a bitch!

1327
01:32:50,041 --> 01:32:51,458
Phew.

1328
01:32:53,708 --> 01:32:56,125
Did I mention
that we have a new recliner?

1329
01:32:56,208 --> 01:32:57,208
Maybe.

1330
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:02,250
It's kind of leather-esque.
It smells like, a little like beef jerky.

1331
01:33:03,208 --> 01:33:05,208
Well,
that's a smell I generally like.

1332
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:10,208
You know, I was thinking, uh,

1333
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:13,166
a sectional sofa would work in that room.

1334
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:15,250
Where?

1335
01:33:15,333 --> 01:33:17,750
In the window nook, facing in.

1336
01:33:18,291 --> 01:33:19,791
Where Katie used to play.

1337
01:33:21,958 --> 01:33:23,083
That'll work.

1338
01:33:25,166 --> 01:33:26,708
Oh, shit. I, uh,

1339
01:33:27,208 --> 01:33:28,500
I made you something.

1340
01:33:29,708 --> 01:33:31,458
Oh, it's lovely.

1341
01:33:33,291 --> 01:33:34,833
You don't know what it is.

1342
01:33:34,916 --> 01:33:38,750
- Does it have a purpose?
- Yes. It's a light switch cover.

1343
01:33:39,791 --> 01:33:41,583
Oh, well,

1344
01:33:42,375 --> 01:33:45,708
there's no hole for the switch.

1345
01:33:47,125 --> 01:33:48,833
Does it need a hole to work?

1346
01:33:49,458 --> 01:33:51,708
Well, yeah. I mean, you...

1347
01:33:51,791 --> 01:33:55,666
you gotta have a hole for the switch,
or you can't turn the light on or off.

1348
01:33:56,291 --> 01:33:57,375
And then what?

1349
01:34:00,291 --> 01:34:01,125
I'm sorry.

1350
01:34:01,208 --> 01:34:03,500
- Well, we'll figure it out.
- No, no. I'm...

1351
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:10,333
I'm so sorry about it all.

1352
01:34:11,291 --> 01:34:13,583
- You deserve better.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1353
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:16,791
It's okay.

1354
01:34:22,833 --> 01:34:23,958
I presume that...

1355
01:34:25,958 --> 01:34:27,708
this makes up for everything.

1356
01:34:33,541 --> 01:34:34,916
We'll cut a hole in it.

1357
01:34:35,625 --> 01:34:36,750
That's smart.

1358
01:34:37,791 --> 01:34:38,833
That's smart.

1359
01:34:39,416 --> 01:34:40,750
Just cut a hole in it.

1360
01:34:41,333 --> 01:34:43,833
Otherwise, you're really...
you're forcing a choice

1361
01:34:43,916 --> 01:34:47,375
of being in constant darkness
or constant light.

1362
01:34:47,458 --> 01:34:48,750
And that's just nuts.

1363
01:34:50,708 --> 01:34:52,958
- I mean, no offense.
- No, that's fair.
