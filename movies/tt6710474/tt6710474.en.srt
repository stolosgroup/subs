[Evelyn] You know,
he doesn't have to stay here.

I'm not the only one calling him "he."

You want him to come all the way
from China to die like that?

He's not gonna die.

321
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:12,444
Relax your body
in the other universe. Please.

322
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:13,528
[Deirdre] ...these deductions
at your place of business.

323
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,072
[Alpha Waymond] <i>Go into auto-pilot.</i>

324
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,991
[Deirdre] You can't then deduct it
if it's an off...

325
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:21,119
Good. Good.

326
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,538
They don't know you and I
are in this universe yet,

327
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,457
so hopefully I'll have
some time to explain.

328
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,335
I'm not your husband.
At least not the one you know.

329
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:31,296
I'm another version of him
from another life path, another universe.

330
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:34,007
I'm here because we need your help.

331
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,719
Very busy today. No time to help you.

332
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,137
Shh.

333
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,473
There's a great evil
that has taken root in my world

334
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:44,476
and has begun spreading its chaos
throughout the many 'verses.

335
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,436
I have spent years searching for the one

336
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,773
who might be able to match to this great
evil with an even greater good,

337
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,608
and bring back balance.

338
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,818
All those years of searching
have brought me here,

339
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,653
- to this universe.
- [Deirdre] <i>Mrs. Wang...</i>

340
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:56,821
- To you.
- [Deirdre] <i>Hello...</i>

341
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,531
I know it's a lot
to take in right now.

342
00:19:58,615 --> 00:19:59,824
- Got to do it.
- Mrs. Wang.

343
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,159
[sing-songy] Hello?

344
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,080
Look, I'm sure
you have a lot on your mind,

345
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:08,958
but I cannot imagine
anything mattering more

346
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:14,339
than the conversation we are now having
concerning your tax liability.

347
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:18,093
Uh, need I remind you that there is
already a lien on your property?

348
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,053
Repossession is well
within our rights.

349
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,764
I know. I am paying attention.

350
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,270
Do you see these?

351
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:35,777
You don't get one of these
unless you've seen a lot of bullshit.

352
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,320
Excuse my French.

353
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:39,906
Now you may, ahem,

354
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,742
only see a pile of boring forms
and numbers,

355
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,828
but I see a story.

356
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:49,457
With nothing but a stack of receipts,

357
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,877
I can trace the ups and downs
of your lives.

358
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:56,339
And it does not look good.

359
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:01,261
It does not look good.

360
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,514
- But...
- Uh...

361
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:08,601
Sorry, my wife confuses
her hobbies for businesses.

362
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,103
An honest mistake.

363
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:13,314
[Deirdre] Oh... okay.

364
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,401
Well, with all of these, um...

365
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,113
"honest mistakes,"

366
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:23,324
I mean, even if we don't charge you
with fraud,

367
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:27,996
we'll most certainly have to fine you
for gross negligence.

368
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:32,792
You're always trying to confuse us
with these big words.

369
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:37,755
[slowly] I thought you were going to bring
your daughter

370
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:40,508
to help you translate.

371
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:43,178
- I am going to bring my...
- [Alpha Waymond, whispering] Hey!

372
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:45,889
- [Waymond] Sorry, she was going to come.
- [Alpha Waymond] Evelyn!

373
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,098
Evelyn! Are you paying attention?

374
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:48,433
- [Deirdre] <i>Oh, really?</i>
- I cannot talk now.

375
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,018
<i>She's too busy to help her parents?
I see what she...</i>

376
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:51,936
Unless you can help me with my taxes.

377
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,897
- [groans in frustration]
- What is "gross necklaces"?

378
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,107
I know you have a lot of things
on your mind,

379
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:57,859
but nothing could possibly matter more

380
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,944
than this conversation
we are having right now

381
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:03,573
concerning the fate of every single world
of our infinite multiverse.

382
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,658
[Deirdre] <i>Where's the respect for elders?</i>

383
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:11,414
My dear Evelyn, I know you.

384
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:13,666
With every passing moment,

385
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,462
you fear you might have missed your chance
to make something of your life.

386
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:21,090
I'm here to tell you every rejection,

387
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:24,385
every disappointment has led you here,

388
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:26,971
to this moment.

389
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,390
Don't let anything distract you from it.

390
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:33,770
[chuckles]

391
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,566
Do you think this is funny?

392
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:42,237
[speaking Cantonese]

393
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,656
[in English] So, what will it be?

394
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:46,533
[speaks in English and Mandarin together]

395
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:49,577
[door thudding]

396
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:51,621
[in English] Our time here is up.

397
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,665
- They're going to kill us.
- What?

398
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:57,043
Do you think you can give us more time
so we can redo all this?

399
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,170
Do not worry,
this is just a burner universe

400
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:01,256
we're using for communication.

401
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,883
- [exclaiming]
- You will know when it is time to fight.

402
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:06,386
You want to redo...
You're going to re-submit?

403
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,137
I will be in contact soon.

404
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:11,224
[shushing] I think my other husband is
messing up the audit.

405
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,685
Maybe we could look at
all the receipts again and...

406
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:16,312
[Alpha Waymond] Evelyn.

407
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,064

[Waymond speaking Mandarin]

417

[in English] Okay. Everything okay.

[chuckles awkwardly]

419
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,345
I think I forget something at home.

Uh... sit down.

[trash can clangs]

424
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:11,868
You can go.

you will have...

You will have until I leave the office
tonight to bring everything in.

Six P.M.

Now let me assure you of one thing.

Just like the rest

Every surrounding bubble
has slight variations.

But the further away
you get from your universe,

the bigger the differences.
This is where I am from...

I've seen you die a thousand ways
in a thousand worlds.

In every single one, you were murdered.

What? Why would anybody want to kill me?

She's an omniversal being
with unimaginable power.

We need another exit.

So, let her destroy the other bubbles.
You said there are so many of them.

627

[scoffs] Maybe it's okay if we lose some,

She's been building something.

630
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:44,286
We thought it was
some sort of black hole,

You've been feeling it, too, haven't you?

636

Something is off.

637

Your clothes never wear
as well the next day.

638

Your hair never falls

[in English] We better keep moving.

814
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:51,286
Now you've definitely
got Jobu's attention. Come on.

Stay calm.

816

Your brain is under
an incredible amount of stress.

No, let me finish
talking with my husband.

I thought I was disconnected.

824
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:27,822
Why was I still there?

825
00:48:27,906 --> 00:48:30,825
Your mind, it's like a clay pot
holding water.

826
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:33,495
Every jump opens another crack
causing things to leak through.

827
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:36,414
With training, you will learn
to reseal these cracks.

828

Eat. You need energy.

829

Cream cheese.

Mm!

In my universe,
the cattle were killed off.

832

One of the many things we've lost

Oh, my God.

00:49:01,314 --> 00:49:02,941
what if I want to go back?

836
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,611
What if I want to go back
to the other universe?

I'm back!

Listen, you're only using the other worlds
to acquire special skills.

Do you understand?

842
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:23,753
If you fall for their temptations,
you invite contradiction. Chaos.

843
00:49:23,837 --> 00:49:26,297
Your clay pot could shatter,
and you could die,

844
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:28,341
or far worse.

845
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:31,219
What can be worse than death?

846
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,764
We should keep moving
until reinforcements come.

847

No, no, no.

848

Enough of your clay pots,
cream cheese, no cows.

Explain it all to me now.

850
00:49:48,528 --> 00:49:49,612
You're right.

851
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:52,949
In the Alphaverse,

852
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:56,286
we began training many
young minds to 'verse jump.

853
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:59,581
But there was one who was far
and above the most gifted...

Our little explorer.

855
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,793
You saw her potential,

856
00:50:03,877 --> 00:50:06,921

Please, I don't care about the bagel.

1641
01:32:09,566 --> 01:32:12,903
I don't care about the Alphaverse.
I only care about my Joy.

1642
01:32:12,986 --> 01:32:15,823
Give me back my daughter
and I'll leave you alone forever.

1643

Sorry, no can do.

Why not?

1645

[Jobu] I am your daughter.
Your daughter is me.

1646

Every version of Joy is Jobu Tupaki.

- You can't separate us.
- No.

I have felt everything
your daughter has felt.

1649

And I know the joy...

1650

<i>and the pain of having you as my mother.</i>

1651

For you.

1654
01:32:55,779 --> 01:32:59,908
"Right" is a tiny box invented
by people who are afraid.

1655
01:32:59,992 --> 01:33:03,245
And I know what it feels like
to be trapped inside that box.

It's Gong Gong.</i>

He's a different generation.

1660
01:33:12,963 --> 01:33:15,215
You don't have to hide
behind him anymore.

1661
01:33:15,299 --> 01:33:17,134
You should feel relieved.

1662
01:33:17,217 --> 01:33:21,013
The bagel will show you
the true nature of things.

1663
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:24,141
You'll be free from that box.
Just like me.

1664
01:33:24,224 --> 01:33:26,226
No, no, I'm not like you.

1665
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:29,438
You're young, and your mind
is always changing.

1666
01:33:29,521 --> 01:33:33,650
- I still know who I am.
- You have no idea what you've done.

1667
01:33:34,651 --> 01:33:36,487
You're stuck like this forever.

1668
01:33:38,447 --> 01:33:41,241
No. I'm going back with my Joy,

1669
01:33:41,325 --> 01:33:44,536
to my family, to live my life.

1670
