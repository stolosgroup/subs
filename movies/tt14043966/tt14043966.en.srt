Ask your ma.

106

Ma gave it to me.

113
00:13:05,105 --> 00:13:07,564
She said you shot a red
major clean off his horse

114
00:13:07,565 --> 00:13:08,857
at 700 yards.

115
00:13:12,184 --> 00:13:13,017
I think she said

116
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:15,337
I could shoot a red major
off his horse 700 yards.

117
00:13:16,324 --> 00:13:17,324
I can't.

120
00:13:22,954 --> 00:13:24,987
It ain't polite conversation, son.

121
00:13:26,023 --> 00:13:29,641
You were a sharp shooter?

122
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,352
(Laughs) I'm still a sharp shooter, boy.

Hattie McAllister, who would've thought?

126
00:13:59,462 --> 00:14:01,951
Grilling pigtails, we used to eat candy

127
00:14:01,952 --> 00:14:04,352
and read books in the
back of your daddy's store

128
00:14:05,732 --> 00:14:09,631
that someday we'd be
homesteading this wild country

Are we gonna make it out here?

131
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:17,994
Just gotta have a little grit.

132
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:21,244
I don't know where to find that anymore.

133
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,450
Sure you do.

134
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:25,451
I know.

135

Pa shot that coyote from half mile away.

Oh, it was more like 100 yards.

157
00:19:15,498 --> 00:19:19,458
Good lord, hat. What the hell happened?

I'm sorry.

162
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:49,480
They must have wandered

reckon I can get a work with the railroad.

168

Buy you a ticket.

of this god forsaken place.

172
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:24,914
I know it's been hard,
but this here's good land.

173
00:20:24,915 --> 00:20:26,358
We live in a shack, Jeb.

174
00:20:27,795 --> 00:20:30,704
We've got old tools, worn out live stock,

175
00:20:30,705 --> 00:20:31,754
and can only feed our children

176
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:33,555
with food borrowed off store credit.

177
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:38,027
I understand it's been tough.

178
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:42,883
But this is our dream, Hattie.

179
00:20:42,884 --> 00:20:44,953
This is what we set out to do,

180
00:20:44,954 --> 00:20:47,004
build a home on land we can call our own.

181
00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:50,624
I want you to ask my daddy for a job.

182
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:55,483
You want us to crawl back to him?

183
00:20:55,484 --> 00:20:57,163
We can't make it on our own.

184
00:20:57,164 --> 00:20:59,613
Hell, yes, we can. We
just gotta keep on going.

185
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,043
Well, I can't.

186
00:21:04,576 --> 00:21:07,326
(Fire crackling)

187
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:16,434
(Wind roaring)

188
00:21:16,435 --> 00:21:18,102
That's good.

189
00:21:23,862 --> 00:21:26,651
I'm gonna ahead into town, grab supplies.

190
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:27,485
Be a strong boy.

191
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,609
Look after your mom
while I'm in town, won't ya?

192
00:21:32,714 --> 00:21:35,297
(Wind roaring)

193
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:41,154
(Horse whickering)

194
00:21:41,155 --> 00:21:44,095
(Horse neighing)

195
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:45,096
Here, pa.

196
00:21:46,444 --> 00:21:49,027
(Wind roaring)

197
00:21:53,925 --> 00:21:57,082
(Jeb whistling)
(Horse whickering)

198
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,833
(Wagon rattling)

199
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:11,099
Jeb.
Hiyah, go! (Whistles)

200
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:16,100
(Wind whooshing)
(Wagon rattling)

201
00:22:28,475 --> 00:22:31,225
(Birds chirping)

202
00:22:34,403 --> 00:22:36,986
(Hay rustling)

203
00:22:38,403 --> 00:22:41,320
(Horse whickering)

204
00:22:45,314 --> 00:22:47,948
I think we've earned it.

205
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,632
Pa says candy's a real treat,

206
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:52,751
just for Christmas and funerals.

207
00:22:55,328 --> 00:22:56,497
When I was a girl in St. Louis,

208
00:22:56,498 --> 00:22:57,911
we'd have candy every week.

209
00:22:58,748 --> 00:23:00,127
Really?

210
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,987
We'd have ice cream in the summer,

211
00:23:01,988 --> 00:23:06,247
toffee in the fall and
peppermint sticks at Christmas.

212
00:23:06,248 --> 00:23:07,848
You would've loved living there.

213
00:23:10,628 --> 00:23:12,547
Is it true that granny and
gramps didn't want you

214
00:23:12,548 --> 00:23:13,547
to marry pa?

215
00:23:14,887 --> 00:23:16,146
They just had their own ideas

216
00:23:16,147 --> 00:23:18,216
about what they wanted for me.

217
00:23:18,217 --> 00:23:22,416
But pa's a hero. He defended
Missouri from the rebs.

218
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:23,744
Your pa was a reb.

219
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,087
He used it to be join up to save the union.

220
00:23:30,517 --> 00:23:32,217
Things weren't simple back then.

221
00:23:34,327 --> 00:23:35,327
Will.

222
00:23:41,683 --> 00:23:44,433
(Birds chirping)

223
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,791
(Hooves thundering)

224
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:11,854
I might fine morning to you, ma'am.

225
00:24:11,855 --> 00:24:13,504
And to you.

226
00:24:13,505 --> 00:24:17,588
I wonder if we might trouble
you for some of your water.

227
00:24:18,635 --> 00:24:22,203
Our mounts are about dried
out and we're not much better.

228
00:24:22,204 --> 00:24:23,554
Take as much as you like.

229
00:24:24,844 --> 00:24:25,957
Much obliged.

230
00:24:35,867 --> 00:24:38,617
(Chain rattling)

231
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:41,174
Will.

232
00:24:47,815 --> 00:24:49,772
(Blow thudding)
(Men laughing)

233
00:24:49,773 --> 00:24:51,992
What's the matter with you, son.

234
00:24:51,993 --> 00:24:53,843
Didn't your ma teach you any manners?

235
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,322
You didn't have no ma,
dropped out of a whore

236
00:24:58,323 --> 00:25:00,854
and raised by those fur
traders, is what I heard.

237
00:25:00,855 --> 00:25:03,105
(Men laughing)

238
00:25:03,106 --> 00:25:04,656
I do apologize, ma'am.

239
00:25:05,642 --> 00:25:07,981
We have been in the saddle
for about three months now

240
00:25:07,982 --> 00:25:10,741
and I'm afraid it is beginning to show.

241
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:13,341
Um, I couldn't help, but
notice your Coop over yonder,

242
00:25:13,342 --> 00:25:17,431
I, I wonder if I might
offer to buy some salt pork

243
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,591
and maybe a dozen eggs.

244
00:25:19,592 --> 00:25:20,992
Fetch as many as you need.

245
00:25:24,134 --> 00:25:25,134
Well.

246
00:25:27,032 --> 00:25:28,011
I must confess,

247
00:25:28,012 --> 00:25:31,204
I, I do feel a bit forward
talking business with a lady.

248
00:25:32,137 --> 00:25:33,934
Uh, is your husband at home?

249
00:25:35,581 --> 00:25:38,164
He ain't here. He gone to town.

250
00:25:41,161 --> 00:25:45,090
Oh, well then I guess
that makes you the man

251
00:25:45,091 --> 00:25:46,241
of the house, I reckon.

252
00:25:47,729 --> 00:25:50,478
(Horse neighing)

253
00:25:54,326 --> 00:25:56,699
(Men laughing)

254
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,683
Oh, uh, one more thing.

255
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,609
Is that a Missouri accent that I detect.

256
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,869
St. Louis.

257
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,319
I knew it. What a happy coincidence.

258
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,949
I am a Cameron man,
myself, that big fella over there,

259
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:14,596
he's from Arkansas, but we
try not to hold that against it.

260
00:26:14,597 --> 00:26:16,558
(Men laughing)

261
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,318
We don't get many missourians out this way.

262
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,972
No, ma'am, I expect you don't.

263
00:26:26,014 --> 00:26:28,931
(Horse whickering)

264
00:26:30,263 --> 00:26:35,262
I'd be happy to cook you men
some breakfast before you go.

265
00:26:36,238 --> 00:26:39,661
Well, we would be much obliged.

266
00:26:50,158 --> 00:26:51,758
This is very kind of you, ma'am.

267
00:26:55,195 --> 00:26:58,194
(Footsteps tapping)

268
00:27:04,647 --> 00:27:07,166
Those your folks over there, Mrs. Uh?

269
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,696
McAllister.
McAllister.

270
00:27:08,697 --> 00:27:11,670
Hattie. This is Bess and this is will.

271
00:27:12,657 --> 00:27:13,657
Set the table.

272
00:27:17,697 --> 00:27:18,926
How old are you?

273
00:27:18,927 --> 00:27:21,025
Nine and three quarters.

274
00:27:21,026 --> 00:27:24,629
Why then, I reckon that's big
enough to wear one of these.

275
00:27:26,942 --> 00:27:29,525
(Men laughing)

276
00:27:30,836 --> 00:27:34,315
This is a lovely home you
have here, Mrs. McAllister.

277
00:27:34,316 --> 00:27:35,819
Your husband is a lucky man.

278
00:27:39,735 --> 00:27:42,234
(Bess cooing)

279
00:27:43,277 --> 00:27:46,224
(Bess crying)

280
00:27:46,225 --> 00:27:48,774
She wants to talk. (Laughs)

281
00:27:48,775 --> 00:27:50,638
Oh, now here, allow me.

282
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:54,005
I've held a baby at two in my life.

283
00:27:55,346 --> 00:27:57,744
Yeah. You okay?

284
00:27:57,745 --> 00:27:58,745
Yeah.

285
00:27:59,501 --> 00:28:02,001
(Bess cooing)

286
00:28:06,011 --> 00:28:10,181
Now Dixie forever

287
00:28:10,182 --> 00:28:13,012
she's never at a loss

288
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:15,182
down with the eagle

289
00:28:15,183 --> 00:28:18,172
up with the cross.

290
00:28:18,173 --> 00:28:20,480
We will rally around the flag, boys

291
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:23,929
we'll rally 'round again

292
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:27,089
shout, shout the battle cry of

293
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,030
freedom

294
00:28:29,031 --> 00:28:31,614
(men laughing)

295
00:28:33,168 --> 00:28:36,199
Now Dixie forever

296
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,656
she's never had a loss

297
00:28:38,657 --> 00:28:39,831
Bess.

298
00:28:39,832 --> 00:28:42,594
Down with the eagle

299
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:43,762
and up with the cross

300
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,168
gonna go fetch some eggs.

301
00:28:45,169 --> 00:28:47,441
We will rally round the flag, boys

302
00:28:47,442 --> 00:28:49,431
we'll rally 'round again

303
00:28:49,432 --> 00:28:50,432
yeah. Come on.

304
00:28:51,454 --> 00:28:52,720
Shout shout

305
00:28:52,721 --> 00:28:55,198
the battle cry of freedom

306
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:56,691
hey, hey. Hey.

307
00:28:56,692 --> 00:28:57,805
Is that a reb song?

308
00:28:59,844 --> 00:29:02,427
(Bess squawks)

309
00:29:09,408 --> 00:29:12,050
(Laughs) Need to teach her that song.

310
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:14,420
You never heard that song before.

311
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:15,504
You like that song?

312
00:29:17,901 --> 00:29:20,901
(Chickens clucking)

313
00:29:26,528 --> 00:29:29,195
(Door scraping)

314
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:32,752
(Birds chirping)

315
00:29:32,753 --> 00:29:37,752
(Horse whickering)
(Birds chirping)

316
00:29:53,755 --> 00:29:56,255
(Bess cooing)

317
00:29:59,146 --> 00:30:01,729
(Men laughing)

318
00:30:06,257 --> 00:30:08,198
Happy girl now, doo, doo

319
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:12,201
(Bess cooing)
(Captain laughing)

320
00:30:12,202 --> 00:30:14,316
What a gentle little soul she is.

321
00:30:18,145 --> 00:30:20,931
You ain' got a problem
with rebs, now do you, boy.

322
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:27,617
Our young host was
born after hostilities ended.

323
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:30,411
I'm sure he's a proud
American, aren't you, boy.

324
00:30:31,758 --> 00:30:32,957
Nothing wrong with that,

325
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:35,867
man should be loyal to his own country.

326
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:36,868
Not everybody is.

327
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:41,027
My daddy was a sharp shooter.

328
00:30:41,028 --> 00:30:42,027
Was he now?

329
00:30:43,397 --> 00:30:45,916
Will's not a bad shot himself.

330
00:30:45,917 --> 00:30:47,296
Why don't you go show these gentlemen

331
00:30:47,297 --> 00:30:49,247
that shotgun your daddy got you.

332
00:30:59,244 --> 00:31:01,066
Easy now.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

333
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,350
Let me see that.

334
00:31:03,274 --> 00:31:04,623
Oh my goodness.

335
00:31:08,746 --> 00:31:11,482
Those rebs best be
careful coming around here.

336
00:31:11,483 --> 00:31:16,483
Oh.
(Men laughing)

337
00:31:18,706 --> 00:31:20,626
Will, warm up the coffee.

338
00:31:32,205 --> 00:31:33,764
Hope you like strawberry jam.

339
00:31:33,765 --> 00:31:35,564
That's all we could grow this spring.

340
00:31:35,565 --> 00:31:37,548
Oh, I'm sure we like it just fine.

341
00:31:39,855 --> 00:31:43,518
Before we dig in, boys, we
like to have a little prayer.

342
00:31:44,775 --> 00:31:45,798
Keep us humble.

343
00:31:47,895 --> 00:31:48,894
Lord,

344
00:31:50,594 --> 00:31:53,773
please look down on us
and help us to be grateful

345
00:31:53,774 --> 00:31:56,233
for these gifts that we have been given

346
00:31:56,234 --> 00:31:59,053
and help us to be always mindful

347
00:31:59,054 --> 00:32:03,283
of the needs of others and
not think only of ourselves.

348
00:32:03,284 --> 00:32:06,643
We pray in the name of
your son, Jesus Christ.

349
00:32:06,644 --> 00:32:08,773
Amen.
Amen.

350
00:32:08,774 --> 00:32:09,715
All right.

351
00:32:09,716 --> 00:32:12,974
(Gun clicks)
Ma!

352
00:32:12,975 --> 00:32:15,492
(Bess cooing)

353
00:32:15,493 --> 00:32:19,726
Will, get behind the
stove with your sister. Now!

354
00:32:22,396 --> 00:32:24,896
(Bess crying)

355
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:34,185
There must be some misunderstanding, ma'am.

356
00:32:35,112 --> 00:32:36,315
How have we offended?

357
00:32:39,942 --> 00:32:41,895
I don't feed killers in my house.

358
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,002
Killers.

359
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:48,595
Good lord. (Laughs)

360
00:32:48,596 --> 00:32:50,411
Oh, oh, I see the confusion.

361
00:32:50,412 --> 00:32:52,931
Boy, she is talking about those trophies

362
00:32:52,932 --> 00:32:55,964
that we got off that Cheyenne
trader near fort laramie.

363
00:32:57,551 --> 00:32:59,950
Ma'am, I realize that's
an unseemly business,

364
00:32:59,951 --> 00:33:01,930
but those can be very valuable objects

365
00:33:01,931 --> 00:33:04,420
when you're trading in the back country.

366
00:33:04,421 --> 00:33:07,941
Now can't we just sit back down

367
00:33:08,811 --> 00:33:10,090
and talk about something more pleasant.

368
00:33:10,091 --> 00:33:11,774
We were having such a nice time.

369
00:33:13,931 --> 00:33:15,584
I think it's best you go now.

370
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:20,289
What the hell are we waiting for?

371
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,153
She's only got two rounds.

372
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,699
As you wish.

373
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,193
And leave your guns.

374
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,420
The hell we will.

375
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,249
Ma'am, I'm sure you understand

376
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,962
how valuable these weapons are.

377
00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:44,742
You can trade your
scalps for some new ones.

378
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:53,999
You heard the woman.

379
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:03,877
Uh-uh, these were my pa's.

380
00:34:03,878 --> 00:34:06,131
They took him off his
dead body of pea Ridge.

381
00:34:10,538 --> 00:34:11,538
Fine.

382
00:34:20,988 --> 00:34:22,511
Can I have my hat?

383
00:34:24,008 --> 00:34:25,258
Will, give him his hat.

384
00:35:15,634 --> 00:35:18,384
(Horse neighing)

385
00:35:20,548 --> 00:35:22,048
Hiyah!

386
00:35:27,524 --> 00:35:30,191
(Door creaking)

387
00:35:53,064 --> 00:35:56,455
(Cabinet thudding)

388
00:35:56,456 --> 00:35:57,456
Help me.

389
00:35:58,312 --> 00:36:03,312
(Bess crying)
(Both groaning)

390
00:36:06,621 --> 00:36:07,621
Push! Push!

391
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:14,600
(Bess screaming)

392
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:20,780

Son of a bitch!

(Gun firing)
(Hattie groaning)

399
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:48,171
Ah, get down!

400
00:36:55,218 --> 00:36:57,055
(Horse neighing)
(Gun firing)

401
00:36:57,056 --> 00:36:57,999
Wait a sec! Come and see!

402
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,606
(Gun firing)
(Glass crashing)

403
00:36:59,607 --> 00:37:03,125
Come and see! (Groaning)

404
00:37:03,126 --> 00:37:08,126
Son of a bitch!
(Gun firing)

405

(Horse neighing)

415
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,394
Hyah! What the hell are you doing?

416
00:38:11,395 --> 00:38:12,812
I want 'em alive!

417
00:38:18,286 --> 00:38:19,850
Whoo! She can't shoot for Jack shit.

418
00:38:22,145 --> 00:38:24,490
(Men panting)
(Bess crying)

419
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:26,652
I need you to be brave. Okay?

420
00:38:26,653 --> 00:38:27,653
Okay.

421
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:29,407
Reload.

422
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,517
Take care of your sister.

423
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:39,767
(Bess crying)

424
00:38:41,731 --> 00:38:44,018

(Hattie gasping)

441
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:42,654
Just take what you want and go.

442
00:40:44,405 --> 00:40:46,987
(Gun clicking)

443
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:59,172
(Hooves thudding)

444
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:14,582
(Laughs) But what we want is you.

445
00:41:22,195 --> 00:41:25,195
(Crickets chirping)

446
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:29,148
I can do anything.

447
00:41:29,149 --> 00:41:32,541
Lay track, shoot buffalo, run the teams.

448
00:41:33,438 --> 00:41:36,137
I appreciate the interest, Mr. McAllister.

449
00:41:36,138 --> 00:41:38,057
There simply isn't the work.

450
00:41:38,058 --> 00:41:40,577
We have more than enough
men to meet our needs.

451
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:41,957
There has to be something.

452
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:44,147
I could even help with the Chuck wagons.

453
00:41:44,148 --> 00:41:46,487
Oh lord, we're not cowboys.

454
00:41:46,488 --> 00:41:48,738
We just bring our food
up from down the line.

455
00:41:50,538 --> 00:41:52,248
Good day. Best of luck.

456
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,483
(Gentle music)

457
00:42:16,565 --> 00:42:17,991
(Bess crying)

458
00:42:17,992 --> 00:42:21,242
You're all right. It's okay.

459
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:23,773
Here we go.

460
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,860
Okay. Okay.

461
00:42:30,705 --> 00:42:33,146
Mrs. McAllister.

462
00:42:33,147 --> 00:42:38,147
(Gun clicking)
(Bess crying)

463
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,273
Hide your sister.

464
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:01,258
(Gun clicking)

465
00:43:06,974 --> 00:43:09,917
Mrs. McAllister.
That's far enough.

466
00:43:12,104 --> 00:43:14,354
I regret that we got off on the wrong foot.

467
00:43:16,304 --> 00:43:19,577
I would like for us to
start over, make it right.

468
00:43:21,914 --> 00:43:24,102
There's nothing to talk about,

469
00:43:24,103 --> 00:43:27,016
except you men getting on
your horses and riding off.

470
00:43:28,303 --> 00:43:32,476
I respect how you must be
feeling and I can sympathize,

471
00:43:33,913 --> 00:43:38,566
but this standoff not doing
anybody a lick of good.

472
00:43:42,373 --> 00:43:44,862
It's true that I've done
my share of killing

473
00:43:44,863 --> 00:43:46,545
both during the war and after.

474
00:43:47,982 --> 00:43:49,875
But one thing I ain't never done,

475
00:43:51,102 --> 00:43:53,505
I ain't never hurt a woman or a child.

476
00:43:55,062 --> 00:43:57,412
Why should I believe a word you say.

477
00:44:03,522 --> 00:44:04,815
I had a daughter once.

478
00:44:06,732 --> 00:44:10,604
She was my only child, apple of my eye.

479
00:44:16,541 --> 00:44:19,000
Every bit of love and
affection a father can give

480
00:44:19,001 --> 00:44:20,624
I lavished on that child.

481
00:44:25,361 --> 00:44:26,504
She's dead now.

482
00:44:28,931 --> 00:44:30,343
Buried out Cameron way.

483
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:34,909
(Wind whistling)

484
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,883
I swear on her grave,

485
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:43,959
I will not harm a hair on your head

486
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,610
or on the heads of your children.

487
00:44:48,178 --> 00:44:50,845
(Guns clicking)

488
00:44:54,219 --> 00:44:55,219
Dammit!

489
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:58,570
(Guns firing)

490
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:03,319
Damn fools!

(Gun clicking)
(Gold tooth panting)

492

(Bess crying)

493
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,668
You okay? You okay?

494
00:45:20,779 --> 00:45:23,196
(Gun firing)

495
00:45:25,377 --> 00:45:30,377

(Bess crying)

498
00:45:42,938 --> 00:45:46,132
I'm sorry, mom. I didn't mean to wake her.

499
00:45:46,133 --> 00:45:47,659
That's all right.

500
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:48,979
Bring her here.

501
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,480
(Bess crying)

502
00:46:05,524 --> 00:46:08,191
(Door scraping)

00:46:11,482 --> 00:46:13,899
(Cow mooing)

504
00:46:19,896 --> 00:46:21,063
Come on, Bess.

505
00:46:28,148 --> 00:46:29,828
What are they doing with Daisy?

506
00:46:33,067 --> 00:46:35,650
(Gun clicking)

507
00:46:38,015 --> 00:46:39,015
No.

508
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:41,429
(Gun firing)

509
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:42,430
No!

510
00:46:44,928 --> 00:46:46,226
No.

511
00:46:46,227 --> 00:46:51,227
(Men laughing)
(Bess screaming)

512
00:46:59,379 --> 00:47:04,379
(Knife scraping)
(Blood squirting)

513
00:47:12,093 --> 00:47:15,436
Sorry.
(Long hair groaning)

514
00:47:22,091 --> 00:47:22,924
Now, you hold him.

515
00:47:22,925 --> 00:47:26,137
Oh, hell, captain, it'll heal itself.

516
00:47:26,138 --> 00:47:28,073
It'll heal on its own, captain.

517
00:47:28,074 --> 00:47:30,181
It'll heal on its own.

518
00:47:30,182 --> 00:47:32,727
Jesus, Joseph and Mary, no.

519
00:47:32,728 --> 00:47:35,905
Please refrain from that papist blasphemy.

520
00:47:35,906 --> 00:47:37,130
Open his sleeve.

521
00:47:37,131 --> 00:47:41,830
Damn them all to hell! (Sobbing)

522
00:47:41,831 --> 00:47:45,706
Well I reckon that all the
sufferings of this present age

523
00:47:45,707 --> 00:47:47,635
are not worthy compared to the glory,

524
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:52,002
which shall be revealed in us.

525
00:47:56,692 --> 00:47:59,226
It's gonna be all right.

526
00:47:59,227 --> 00:48:03,450
Pa couldn't have been reb,
ma, just couldn't have been.

527
00:48:03,451 --> 00:48:05,101
That's what you're upset about?

528
00:48:07,769 --> 00:48:10,954
(Sighs) Your pa's no rebel.

529
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:13,500
He may have begun fighting for the south,

530
00:48:13,501 --> 00:48:16,353
but he ended that war a patriot.

531
00:48:19,235 --> 00:48:20,904
But you said that he was-

532
00:48:20,905 --> 00:48:23,105
good and bad aren't always so clear, will.

533
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:25,197
Sometimes you wake up

534
00:48:25,198 --> 00:48:28,199
and you realize you're
on the wrong side of things.

535
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,200
And when you pa did,

536
00:48:30,162 --> 00:48:32,279
he have the courage to make things right.

537
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,663
Just like he always does.

538
00:48:41,189 --> 00:48:42,692
And when he comes back,

539
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,772
those killers outside are
gonna feel god's wrath.

540
00:48:50,069 --> 00:48:52,022
What if they kill him instead?

541
00:48:55,294 --> 00:48:57,877
(Hattie sighs)

542
00:49:12,465 --> 00:49:15,215
(Fire crackling)

543
00:49:19,288 --> 00:49:20,371
Better eat up, son.

544
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:24,810
Hard to be brave on an empty belly.

545
00:49:29,727 --> 00:49:33,270
Well, captain, there's,

546
00:49:35,877 --> 00:49:37,556
there's just something about all this

547
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:40,170
that I don't rightly understand.

548
00:49:43,557 --> 00:49:44,556
Go on.

549
00:49:45,476 --> 00:49:49,349
Well, it's all you said about
not hurting women or kids.

550
00:49:54,206 --> 00:49:56,306
And you think we ought to stand by that.

551
00:50:04,766 --> 00:50:07,434
You remember when your pappy and I rode out

552
00:50:07,435 --> 00:50:11,004
to defend our way of life
from the tyrant Lincoln.

553
00:50:11,005 --> 00:50:12,005
I do.

554
00:50:13,945 --> 00:50:15,845
We had a lot of fine ideas then

555
00:50:17,249 --> 00:50:20,004
about chivalry and honor

556
00:50:20,005 --> 00:50:23,488
and what war should look like.

557
00:50:25,405 --> 00:50:29,637
How the rightness of our
cause would carry us to victory.

558
00:50:35,544 --> 00:50:38,937
And the Yankees stole our cattle.

559
00:50:41,034 --> 00:50:42,473
They burned our farms

560
00:50:42,474 --> 00:50:46,287
and hung our kin without cause.

561
00:50:48,024 --> 00:50:50,614
And all our fine notions were nothing

562
00:50:51,623 --> 00:50:56,623
in the face of their
rapacious, murderous hatred.

563
00:51:06,173 --> 00:51:07,976
They took my only child from me,

564
00:51:12,383 --> 00:51:14,102
ripped her from this life

565
00:51:16,822 --> 00:51:18,535
without mercy or pity.

566
00:51:23,092 --> 00:51:27,062
And there ain't no law on earth

567
00:51:28,822 --> 00:51:30,602
or in heaven or hell

568
00:51:33,622 --> 00:51:37,854
that can keep a father
from taking his revenge.

569
00:51:41,421 --> 00:51:42,421
Not the devil

570
00:51:48,501 --> 00:51:49,914
And not god himself.

571
00:51:59,303 --> 00:52:01,720
That make things any clearer?

572
00:52:03,714 --> 00:52:06,464
(Fire crackling)

573
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,850
Hell, we ain't gonna have
to hurt anybody anyway.

574
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,113
How you figure that?

575
00:52:21,259 --> 00:52:24,142
Mrs. McAllister ain't
cut out for this kinda life.

576
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:28,162
I can tell that by looking in her eyes.

577
00:52:30,139 --> 00:52:31,522
We give her enough time,

578
00:52:32,539 --> 00:52:34,642
she's just gonna come on out here to us.

579
00:52:37,789 --> 00:52:39,712
That's the sensible thing to do.

580
00:52:41,269 --> 00:52:43,711
And she is a sensible woman.

581
00:52:43,712 --> 00:52:45,201
Captain!
What?

582
00:52:48,228 --> 00:52:49,228
The hell.

583
00:52:50,694 --> 00:52:52,527
Damnation!

584
00:52:53,974 --> 00:52:58,974
(Bess crying)
(Fire roaring)

585
00:53:03,065 --> 00:53:08,064
(Ax thudding)
(Bess crying)

586
00:53:16,812 --> 00:53:18,262
They'll see that for miles.

587
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,823
(Gun clicking)

588
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,806
Ma!

589
00:53:26,807 --> 00:53:28,358
Keep it burning, you understand?

590
00:53:28,359 --> 00:53:29,877
Anything you can find.

591
00:53:29,878 --> 00:53:33,082
(Bess screaming)
(Hattie panting)

592
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:36,291
(Gun firing)

593
00:53:36,292 --> 00:53:38,698
(Door scraping)

594
00:53:38,699 --> 00:53:43,699
(Fire roaring)
(Bess screaming)

595
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:50,160
(Hattie panting)
(Door scraping)

596
00:53:51,833 --> 00:53:53,631
(Gun clicking)

597
00:53:53,632 --> 00:53:56,095
(Gun firing)

598
00:53:56,096 --> 00:54:00,761
(Glass crashing)
(Hattie groaning)

599
00:54:00,762 --> 00:54:03,429
(Door creaking)

600
00:54:06,083 --> 00:54:11,083
(Bess crying)
(Fire roaring)

601
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,667
(Gun firing)

602
00:54:23,782 --> 00:54:26,304
(Men panting)
(Bess crying)

603
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:27,305
Look.

604
00:54:29,876 --> 00:54:32,543
(Both coughing)

605
00:54:41,797 --> 00:54:45,272
(Fire crackling)
(Bess crying)

606
00:54:45,273 --> 00:54:48,856
(Hattie and will coughing)

607
00:55:00,814 --> 00:55:03,564
(Bess screaming)

608
00:55:05,315 --> 00:55:10,315
Will, your sister. (Coughing)

609
00:55:21,487 --> 00:55:24,650
(Men panting)

610
00:55:24,651 --> 00:55:27,318
(Guns clicking)

611
00:55:35,043 --> 00:55:38,043
(Hooves thundering)

612
00:55:48,026 --> 00:55:51,108
(Horse whickering)

613
00:55:51,109 --> 00:55:52,526
Come to a help.

614
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,180
The children are still inside?

615
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:00,880
You come alone, neighbor?

616
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:04,719
Yeah, I see the smoke,
I come riding real fast.

617
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,042
Why? What's wrong.

618
00:56:07,749 --> 00:56:10,339
Mr. Sameson, no, go get help.

619
00:56:13,238 --> 00:56:14,675
Get help!

620
00:56:14,676 --> 00:56:16,388
No. I want him alive.

621
00:56:16,389 --> 00:56:18,992
Ride, Mr. Sameson, ride!

622
00:56:25,832 --> 00:56:28,228
(Fire roaring)

623
00:56:28,229 --> 00:56:31,062
(Hooves thudding)

624
00:56:53,722 --> 00:56:58,050
(Bess crying)
(Hattie coughing)

625
00:56:58,051 --> 00:57:00,801
(Fire crackling)

626
00:57:06,401 --> 00:57:07,234
Let it burn!

627
00:57:07,235 --> 00:57:09,690
Are you crazy? Captain wants them alive.

628
00:57:12,084 --> 00:57:14,834
(Glass crashing)

629
00:57:22,199 --> 00:57:24,296
Just trying to help.

630
00:57:24,297 --> 00:57:27,047
(Bess screaming)

631
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:33,041
(Water splashing)

632
00:57:41,729 --> 00:57:46,729
(Lasso whooshing)
(Hooves thudding)

633
00:57:47,253 --> 00:57:50,766
(Mr. Sameson groaning)
(Body thudding)

634
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:55,767
(Horse whickering)
(Birds squawking)

635
00:57:59,622 --> 00:58:02,872
(Mr. Sameson groaning)

636
00:58:08,802 --> 00:58:13,802
(Wind whooshing)
(Birds chirping)

637
00:58:24,129 --> 00:58:26,712
(Fire roaring)

638
00:58:42,989 --> 00:58:44,822
Let him go.

639
00:58:46,772 --> 00:58:49,261
Mrs. McAllister, I'm surprised.

640
00:58:49,262 --> 00:58:52,745
It does not dignify a woman
to holler and carry on such.

641
00:58:53,972 --> 00:58:55,622
He hasn't done anything to you.

642
00:58:58,261 --> 00:58:59,761
Well, that is entirely true.

643
00:59:01,052 --> 00:59:02,821
But as you see,

644
00:59:02,822 --> 00:59:06,964
your obstinance has put
us all in a difficult situation.

645
00:59:09,563 --> 00:59:12,750
So I'm gonna ask you again to come out here

646
00:59:12,751 --> 00:59:15,604
and let us resolve this
like civilized people.

647
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:19,583
Hattie, you stay there.

648
00:59:19,584 --> 00:59:21,360
He's a no good liar.

649
00:59:21,361 --> 00:59:22,361
He can't be trusted.

650
00:59:23,963 --> 00:59:26,113
Of course, you'd rather not be civilized.

651
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:31,143
I'll have to resort to other methods.

652
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:35,369
You don't have to do this.

653
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:39,363
I'd hope not to. See, I'm a preacher's son.

654
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:42,869
I was raised to believe in the good book.

655
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:45,933
It's the only thing that
keeps us from being savages.

656
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:50,308
But even a preacher's
boy has got his limits.

657
00:59:50,309 --> 00:59:53,462
Please. He has a wife and five children.

658
00:59:55,619 --> 00:59:57,328
The lord is my Shepherd.

659
00:59:57,329 --> 00:59:58,329
I shall not want.

660
00:59:59,339 --> 01:00:00,448
You made me to lay down.

661
01:00:00,449 --> 01:00:02,338
I don't like repeating myself.

662
01:00:02,339 --> 01:00:03,172
He led me besides the still waters.

663
01:00:03,173 --> 01:00:07,138
Mrs. McAllister, so I'm gonna say this

664
01:00:07,139 --> 01:00:08,312
one more time.

665
01:00:09,449 --> 01:00:10,309
Come on out!

666
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:12,308
In the valley of the shadow off death,

667
01:00:13,438 --> 01:00:15,277
I will fear no evil.

668
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,305
No. No.

669
01:00:16,306 --> 01:00:18,095
For thou art with me.

670
01:00:18,096 --> 01:00:22,755
(Hattie screaming)
(Blood spurting)

671
01:00:22,756 --> 01:00:25,339
(Men cackling)

672
01:00:31,526 --> 01:00:34,275
(Bess screaming)

673
01:00:35,943 --> 01:00:38,943
(Crickets chirping)

674
01:00:41,408 --> 01:00:46,408
(Table crashing)
(Bess crying)

675
01:00:55,136 --> 01:00:57,885
(Fabric tearing)

676
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,863
(Fire roaring)

677
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,517
(Torch clattering)

678
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:33,083
(Fire roaring)
(Hattie panting)

679
01:01:35,044 --> 01:01:37,627
(Upbeat music)

680
01:02:17,528 --> 01:02:21,892
(Horse whickering)
(Upbeat music)

681
01:02:21,893 --> 01:02:23,816
You left it across the street.

682
01:02:27,022 --> 01:02:28,022
See?

683
01:02:30,262 --> 01:02:33,441
Maybe I best come down
and escort you across.

684
01:02:33,442 --> 01:02:35,419
No, miss, I'm quite all right.

685
01:02:41,902 --> 01:02:45,025
Hey. You really gonna
drive home half liquored up?

686
01:02:46,372 --> 01:02:48,140
Seems to me you ought to sober up

687
01:02:48,141 --> 01:02:50,874
or just go on, get drunk all the way.

688
01:02:53,515 --> 01:02:54,837
I gotta get home to my farm.

689
01:02:54,838 --> 01:02:58,044
Farm? Your farm ain't gonna miss you.

690
01:02:59,031 --> 01:03:01,250
We got real nice beds in there.

691
01:03:01,251 --> 01:03:04,010
Soft satin sheets.

692
01:03:04,011 --> 01:03:05,600
Oh, you could sleep all night.

693
01:03:05,601 --> 01:03:07,351
Wake up first thing in the morning.

694
01:03:08,541 --> 01:03:10,490
Of course, you can do other things too.

695
01:03:11,761 --> 01:03:13,123
My wife.

696
01:03:13,124 --> 01:03:14,563
Your wife?
She's waiting on me.

697
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:19,069
(Scoffs) Something tells me your wife,

698
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:20,663
she don't appreciate you,

699
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:28,060
hard workin' man like you,
not the way you deserve.

700
01:03:30,077 --> 01:03:33,243
(Body thuds)
Oh, geez!

701
01:03:37,228 --> 01:03:42,228
(Upbeat music)
(People chattering)

702
01:03:49,824 --> 01:03:52,084
(Horse neighing)

703
01:03:52,085 --> 01:03:53,168
Hyah!

704
01:03:57,326 --> 01:03:58,159
(Bess cooing)

705
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,941
I think it's time you learned
how to make some coffee.

706
01:04:02,268 --> 01:04:03,518
First, put on some water.

707
01:04:10,664 --> 01:04:13,164
(Bess cooing)

708
01:04:20,521 --> 01:04:23,354
(Water trickling)

709
01:04:27,767 --> 01:04:29,690
Now we need to grind up some beans.

710
01:04:31,247 --> 01:04:33,050
You want 'em fine like table salt.

711
01:04:37,577 --> 01:04:38,827
Can we boil 'em?

712
01:04:39,707 --> 01:04:41,085
That may be how cow hands

713
01:04:41,086 --> 01:04:42,705
make some black sludge they call coffee,

714
01:04:42,706 --> 01:04:44,265
but it's not the proper way.

715
01:04:44,266 --> 01:04:45,915
Well, what do we do different?

716
01:04:45,916 --> 01:04:47,266
How's that grind looking?

717
01:04:49,369 --> 01:04:52,869
(Coffee grinder whirring)

718
01:04:54,526 --> 01:04:56,055
Just like salt.

719
01:04:56,056 --> 01:04:57,225
Good.

720
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,326
Now find something we can use as a filter.

721
01:05:07,538 --> 01:05:10,038
(Bess cooing)

722
01:05:28,934 --> 01:05:30,284
Now we wait for it to boil.

723
01:05:32,384 --> 01:05:34,234
You wanna know how your pa and I met?

724
01:05:38,204 --> 01:05:41,054
I was walking home from
school one day back in St. Louis.

725
01:05:42,254 --> 01:05:46,093
It was during the war and
the streets were full of soldiers.

726
01:05:46,094 --> 01:05:48,132
One bunch decided they
wanted to have some fun.

727
01:05:48,133 --> 01:05:51,942
So they stole my books. (Laughs)

728
01:05:51,943 --> 01:05:54,072
I begged and pleaded
for them to give 'em back.

729
01:05:54,073 --> 01:05:55,073
But they wouldn't.

730
01:05:56,921 --> 01:05:59,112
And just when I started to cry,

731
01:05:59,113 --> 01:06:01,186
I heard someone order those boys to stop.

732
01:06:02,173 --> 01:06:05,412
I turned around expecting
a lieutenant or a captain,

733
01:06:05,413 --> 01:06:06,796
but it was just your pa.

734
01:06:08,833 --> 01:06:10,515
He was all alone,

735
01:06:11,502 --> 01:06:13,395
in a private's uniform no less.

736
01:06:15,432 --> 01:06:17,381
There was one man against six,

737
01:06:17,382 --> 01:06:21,371
but there was something in his voice,

738
01:06:21,372 --> 01:06:22,841
something that said he could still lick

739
01:06:22,842 --> 01:06:26,265
every single one of them,
one at a time or all together.

740
01:06:28,182 --> 01:06:30,341
When they heard it, one by one,

741
01:06:30,342 --> 01:06:31,481
they started to drift away

742
01:06:31,482 --> 01:06:34,784
till the last one, gave me
back my books and apologized.

743
01:06:38,591 --> 01:06:42,010
Your pa asked me if he could walk me home.

744
01:06:42,011 --> 01:06:45,404
I said, yes, but in my
heart, I already knew.

745
01:06:48,007 --> 01:06:49,007
Knew what?

746
01:06:53,379 --> 01:06:56,711
That he was the man I wanted to marry.

747
01:06:57,590 --> 01:07:01,089
That nothing in this world
could ever cause him to give up

748
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:04,513
and whatever would come, he
would stand up and protect me.

749
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:14,623
All right, now pour it over
the beans, nice and slow.

750
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:37,538
How about some more rock candy?

751
01:07:37,539 --> 01:07:39,488
Can't trick your coffee black, can you?

752
01:07:51,231 --> 01:07:56,231
(Thunder rumbling)
(Crickets chirping)

753
01:08:00,447 --> 01:08:01,447
Will. Will!

754
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:05,217
I need you to keep watch.

755
01:08:12,067 --> 01:08:13,507
I'll be right back.

756
01:08:23,807 --> 01:08:24,849
Psst, psst!

757
01:08:28,176 --> 01:08:29,176
Ma!

758
01:08:32,586 --> 01:08:33,586
Don't shoot.

759
01:08:35,136 --> 01:08:36,279
I just come the talk.

760
01:08:38,676 --> 01:08:40,315
You so much as flinch

761
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:42,539
and I swear, I'll put a
bullet through your heart.

762
01:08:43,476 --> 01:08:44,476
I ain't armed.

763
01:08:46,446 --> 01:08:48,334
Right through your heart.

764
01:08:48,335 --> 01:08:49,335
Please.

765
01:08:52,145 --> 01:08:54,107
The others don't know I come.

766
01:08:54,108 --> 01:08:55,158
Will you just listen?

767
01:08:57,875 --> 01:08:59,025
All right. Talk then.

768
01:09:01,287 --> 01:09:03,664
This ain't what I thought I was joining.

769
01:09:03,665 --> 01:09:06,484
We was supposed to Rob banks and trains,

770
01:09:06,485 --> 01:09:08,318
not hurt women and children.

771
01:09:10,834 --> 01:09:12,834
It just don't sit right with me no more.

772
01:09:13,954 --> 01:09:16,383
You stood by why I killed my neighbor.

773
01:09:16,384 --> 01:09:18,573
If I'd done said anything,

774
01:09:18,574 --> 01:09:20,374
I'd be lying dead on the ground too.

775
01:09:23,134 --> 01:09:25,143
I remember my mama once warned me

776
01:09:25,144 --> 01:09:27,127
about falling in with bad company.

777
01:09:28,714 --> 01:09:30,993
Once I did, I didn't realize

778
01:09:30,994 --> 01:09:32,706
how hard it would be to part ways.

779
01:09:34,893 --> 01:09:36,006
Who are they?

780
01:09:37,474 --> 01:09:39,024
They're a gang from Missouri.

781
01:09:40,023 --> 01:09:42,902
They rode with quantrill's
raiders during the war.

782
01:09:42,903 --> 01:09:44,736
Captain was his right hand man.

783
01:09:46,413 --> 01:09:50,462
Most of the fellers gave up
when old quantrill was killed

784
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:51,602
or after the surrender.

785
01:09:51,603 --> 01:09:52,746
But not captain.

786
01:09:53,643 --> 01:09:55,355
The war ain't never ended for him.

787
01:10:00,272 --> 01:10:02,705
Look, if if'n I help you,

788
01:10:04,156 --> 01:10:06,895
will you put in a good world
with the us Marshall for me?

789
01:10:09,752 --> 01:10:11,855
Right then, here's my plan.

790
01:10:12,692 --> 01:10:16,290
The others are sleeping and
I'm supposed to be on watch.

791
01:10:16,291 --> 01:10:19,080
If you and the young ones
can get out of the window,

792
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:21,600
I'll meet you back about a hundred paces.

793
01:10:21,601 --> 01:10:22,601
I'll bring horses.

794
01:10:24,331 --> 01:10:25,800
You can get 'em without waking them.

795
01:10:25,801 --> 01:10:27,801
I already done got 'em all saddled up.

796
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:35,160
(Crickets chirping)

797
01:10:35,161 --> 01:10:36,661
I'll get the children ready.

798
01:10:37,857 --> 01:10:39,293
We'll meet you in 10 minutes.

799
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:43,628
All right.

800
01:10:43,629 --> 01:10:44,517
Thank you.

801
01:10:44,518 --> 01:10:47,980
And we can ride on out afore anyone's wiser

802
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:50,193
and then go find Jeb.

803
01:10:51,535 --> 01:10:54,610
(Gun firing)
(Glass crashing)

804
01:10:54,611 --> 01:10:57,538
(Bess crying)

805
01:10:57,539 --> 01:10:59,372
Jed! Son of a bitch!

806
01:11:01,349 --> 01:11:02,792
She got him, captain.

807
01:11:04,949 --> 01:11:06,602
Now I gotta tell his mama!

808
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:10,708
That dang fool kid couldn't lie for shit!

809
01:11:10,709 --> 01:11:12,088
You mind your tongue.

810
01:11:12,089 --> 01:11:14,402
Ma, he was just trying to help!

811
01:11:19,739 --> 01:11:22,202
I never told him your
pa's name, not one time.

812
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:24,888
Then how did they know it?

813
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:27,597
They're not after us.

814
01:11:27,598 --> 01:11:29,098
They came looking for your pa.

815
01:11:32,638 --> 01:11:35,247
That's why they're out
there taking their time.

816
01:11:35,248 --> 01:11:37,497
That's why they're out there now waiting.

817
01:11:37,498 --> 01:11:38,498
We're just the bait.

818
01:11:39,868 --> 01:11:41,541
Your father's walking into a trap.

819
01:11:42,748 --> 01:11:46,989
Will, I'm gonna need you to do something.

820
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:48,830
And you're gonna have to be brave to do it.

821
01:11:50,907 --> 01:11:52,307
I need you to get the filly.

822
01:11:54,807 --> 01:11:57,919
What? No, I can't.

823
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,473
Yes, you can.

824
01:11:59,474 --> 01:12:01,170
You're your father's son.

825
01:12:03,177 --> 01:12:05,140
It's our turn to protect him.

826
01:12:18,922 --> 01:12:21,922
(Crickets chirping)

827
01:12:28,768 --> 01:12:31,434
(Door creaking)

828
01:12:33,809 --> 01:12:38,809
(Crickets chirping)
(Wind howling)

829
01:12:42,376 --> 01:12:47,376
(Door creaking)
(Wind whistling)

830
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:54,329
(Horse whickering)
(Crickets chirping)

831
01:13:02,998 --> 01:13:04,955
(Fire crackling)
(Long hair groaning)

832
01:13:04,956 --> 01:13:07,539
(Cork popping)

833
01:13:10,964 --> 01:13:15,963
(Groans) That little
yankee bastard! (Groans)

834
01:13:17,524 --> 01:13:22,524
(Wind whistling)
(Crickets chirping)

835
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:40,257
They took that yankee bastard

836
01:13:40,258 --> 01:13:42,684
they shot him in the head

837
01:13:42,685 --> 01:13:44,352
they put him on the fire

838
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:47,936
so if mama saw he's dead

839
01:13:53,878 --> 01:13:54,878
Sh!

840
01:13:57,758 --> 01:13:59,281
(Bess cooing)

841
01:13:59,282 --> 01:14:01,031
It's okay. It's okay.

842
01:14:03,619 --> 01:14:06,347
(Hooves thudding)

843
01:14:06,348 --> 01:14:08,905
The yankee's went to Baltimore

844
01:14:08,906 --> 01:14:12,573
and they came upon a mare

845
01:14:15,527 --> 01:14:20,527
(hooves thudding)
(Crickets chirping)

846
01:14:28,305 --> 01:14:30,972
(Door creaking)

847
01:14:36,262 --> 01:14:38,349
(Footsteps shuffling)

848
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:41,433
(Long hair laughing)

849
01:14:44,370 --> 01:14:47,508
(Hooves thudding)
(Crickets chirping)

850
01:14:47,509 --> 01:14:50,176
(Door creaking)

851
01:14:51,317 --> 01:14:53,082
Hell, captain,

852
01:14:53,083 --> 01:14:56,613
the horses are running to kingdom come!

853
01:14:56,614 --> 01:14:59,237
You get her!

854
01:14:59,238 --> 01:15:00,828
(Wind whistling)

855
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:01,829
Oh, come on.

856
01:15:08,117 --> 01:15:12,784
Son of a bitch! Get back here. (Groans)

857
01:15:13,953 --> 01:15:15,337
(Bess cooing)

858
01:15:15,338 --> 01:15:17,811
Will! Will!

859
01:15:19,128 --> 01:15:20,178
Think you're going.

860
01:15:22,765 --> 01:15:26,061
You know, captain, he didn't
mean you no harm before,

861
01:15:27,348 --> 01:15:28,371
but he does now.

862
01:15:32,229 --> 01:15:35,028
(Horse neighing)
(Blow thudding)

863
01:15:35,029 --> 01:15:37,008
(Bess screaming)

864
01:15:37,009 --> 01:15:38,009
Easy.

865
01:15:40,893 --> 01:15:44,893
(Both groaning)
(Gun firing)

866
01:15:44,894 --> 01:15:46,515
No! No!

867
01:15:46,516 --> 01:15:50,522
No! No!
(Bess screaming)

868
01:15:50,523 --> 01:15:53,816
You don't move. You understand me?

869
01:15:53,817 --> 01:15:55,067
Don't you move!

870
01:15:56,486 --> 01:15:59,403
Oh my god, my god, she got my face!

871
01:16:00,779 --> 01:16:01,862
Will, run!

872
01:16:02,771 --> 01:16:03,604
She got my face!

873
01:16:03,605 --> 01:16:06,198
God, she got my damn face!

874
01:16:06,199 --> 01:16:08,366
Will, run! Run!

875
01:16:10,474 --> 01:16:13,724
(Gold tooth screaming)

876
01:16:17,243 --> 01:16:19,993
(Birds chirping)

877
01:16:20,929 --> 01:16:23,762
(Water whooshing)

878
01:16:48,035 --> 01:16:51,545
(Hooves thudding)

879
01:16:51,546 --> 01:16:54,379
(Water whooshing)

880
01:17:13,173 --> 01:17:15,840
(Water roaring)

881
01:17:29,022 --> 01:17:31,855
(Water splashing)

882
01:17:44,523 --> 01:17:47,023
(Bess crying)

883
01:17:57,817 --> 01:17:58,900
Go, run!
Ma!

884
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,093
Go! Take her!

885
01:18:03,935 --> 01:18:04,768
You run, just take her.

886
01:18:04,769 --> 01:18:07,293
Go to the danielsons. Go! (Groans)

887
01:18:07,294 --> 01:18:08,791
Go! Go!
(Bess crying)

888
01:18:08,792 --> 01:18:11,949
(Indistinct)
(Hattie groaning)

889
01:18:11,950 --> 01:18:13,605
Come here, you!

890
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:16,164
(Water whooshing)
(Bess crying)

891
01:18:16,165 --> 01:18:20,508
Come here, I got you!
(Hattie groaning)

892
01:18:20,509 --> 01:18:25,509
Get out of there! Let go!
(Both groaning)

893
01:18:26,886 --> 01:18:28,303
Where'd you go?

894
01:18:30,433 --> 01:18:32,637
Come on out, I won't hurt ya.

895
01:18:32,638 --> 01:18:35,305
(Both groaning)

896
01:18:39,202 --> 01:18:40,202
Bitch!

897
01:18:46,616 --> 01:18:49,283
(Water roaring)

898
01:18:56,408 --> 01:19:00,790
(Birds squawking)
(Fire crackling)

899
01:19:00,791 --> 01:19:03,311
That was a damn fool
thing you done back there.

900
01:19:04,568 --> 01:19:06,101
Almost got yourself killed.

901
01:19:07,628 --> 01:19:11,077
I told you, I ain't never harmed a woman.

902
01:19:11,078 --> 01:19:13,117
Captain, when we gonna go
get that little yankee bastard?

903
01:19:13,118 --> 01:19:14,976
Shut your mouth.

904
01:19:14,977 --> 01:19:16,827
We got everything we need right here.

905
01:19:18,367 --> 01:19:21,006
All we gotta do is get
Mrs. McAllister back home

906
01:19:21,007 --> 01:19:22,961
before she catches her death out here.

907
01:19:22,962 --> 01:19:24,156
Yeah, but you told me I could get him

908
01:19:24,157 --> 01:19:25,386
and bring him back here and cut his-

909
01:19:25,387 --> 01:19:28,036
shut your belly achin' rotten mouth!

910
01:19:28,037 --> 01:19:30,954
(Birds squawking)

911
01:19:46,513 --> 01:19:50,176
You move, you die.

912
01:19:50,177 --> 01:19:53,010
(Birds squawking)

913
01:19:55,228 --> 01:19:58,395
(Gold tooth groaning)

914
01:20:05,075 --> 01:20:08,104
You want to see how it feels
to get your flesh burned off?

915
01:20:08,105 --> 01:20:09,428
Gentle does it, boys.

916
01:20:16,865 --> 01:20:19,354
As it says in ecclesiastes:

917
01:20:19,355 --> 01:20:21,243
Cast thy bread upon the waters

918
01:20:21,244 --> 01:20:23,917
for thou shalt find it after many days.

919
01:20:26,027 --> 01:20:28,860
(Hooves thudding)

920
01:20:38,255 --> 01:20:41,422
(Gold tooth groaning)

921
01:20:44,303 --> 01:20:45,553
Jeb!

922
01:20:47,916 --> 01:20:48,916
Care to die?

923
01:20:55,773 --> 01:20:57,973
This ain't no way to start a conversation.

924
01:20:59,643 --> 01:21:00,786
Let her go, Miller.

925
01:21:02,343 --> 01:21:03,876
It's captain Miller to you.

926
01:21:05,283 --> 01:21:07,332
I'd appreciate it if you'd remember that.

927
01:21:13,322 --> 01:21:14,522
Where are my children?

928
01:21:16,112 --> 01:21:17,341
They're safe.

929
01:21:17,342 --> 01:21:18,842
They made it across the river.

930
01:21:22,352 --> 01:21:24,752
You still call yourself
a confederate officer.

931
01:21:25,862 --> 01:21:27,962
You got no right to hold a woman prisoner.

932
01:21:30,038 --> 01:21:32,610
"For a man shall leave
his father and mother

933
01:21:32,611 --> 01:21:34,080
and cleave unto his wife.

934
01:21:34,081 --> 01:21:36,180
And they shall be as one flesh."

935
01:21:36,181 --> 01:21:39,090
Genesis chapter two, 24th verse.

936
01:21:39,091 --> 01:21:42,180
Your sins have found you
out, jebediah McAllister,

937
01:21:42,181 --> 01:21:44,644
and now they are visited
upon your whole family.

938
01:21:47,182 --> 01:21:50,015
(Birds squawking)

939
01:21:56,670 --> 01:21:57,670
What do you want?

940
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,439
Vengeance.

941
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,689
Vengeance belongs to the lord, Miller.

942
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:05,883
Well, the lord takes too damn long.

943
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:11,279
Now I can see that I
am being less than clear.

944
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:12,543
So let me be blunt.

945
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:17,008
You either put that gun down

946
01:22:17,009 --> 01:22:18,208
or your pretty little wife

947
01:22:18,209 --> 01:22:20,612
is gonna have her eyes cut out of her head.

948
01:22:22,049 --> 01:22:23,852
You said you never hurt a woman.

949
01:22:26,489 --> 01:22:28,472
I haven't, but he has.

950
01:22:33,299 --> 01:22:36,057
My daughter has laid

951
01:22:36,058 --> 01:22:38,757
in her grave for 12 years,

952
01:22:38,758 --> 01:22:41,667
while her murderers have walked free.

953
01:22:41,668 --> 01:22:43,797
We didn't murder anyone.

954
01:22:43,798 --> 01:22:44,728
It was an accident.

955
01:22:44,729 --> 01:22:45,871
She trusted you.

956
01:22:47,578 --> 01:22:50,427
She trusted you because
you were her countryman.

957
01:22:50,428 --> 01:22:54,151
Not one man there knew
she was inside. Ask him!

958
01:22:55,245 --> 01:22:59,430
(Laughs) Not one man there
draws breath, except you.

959
01:23:02,307 --> 01:23:04,020
We thought it was you in there.

960
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:08,970
No, only my heart.

961
01:23:18,657 --> 01:23:20,365
Make it slow.

962
01:23:20,366 --> 01:23:22,789
Jeb! (Whimpering)

963
01:23:25,046 --> 01:23:28,705
You swear, you won't
hurt her. You'll let her go.

964
01:23:28,706 --> 01:23:30,745
No, no, Jeb!

965
01:23:30,746 --> 01:23:32,249
On my child's grave.

966
01:23:34,316 --> 01:23:35,416
You can't trust him.

967
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:43,416
No.

968
01:23:45,206 --> 01:23:46,623
No, no, no, no!

969
01:23:48,913 --> 01:23:50,559
(Hattie groaning)

970
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:55,548
(Blows thudding)
(Men groaning)

971
01:23:55,549 --> 01:23:56,549
No, no!

972
01:23:58,132 --> 01:24:01,848
Ain't having no more little bastards now!

973
01:24:01,849 --> 01:24:04,462
(Men laughing)

974
01:24:04,463 --> 01:24:06,646
(Hattie groaning)

975
01:24:06,647 --> 01:24:09,049
Hope you don't mind, jebediah.

976
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:10,776
The pleasure's all mine.

977
01:24:10,777 --> 01:24:12,223
You son of a bitch!

978
01:24:12,224 --> 01:24:16,269
(Gold tooth laughing)
(Hattie screaming)

979
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:17,937
Come on, Princess!

980
01:24:33,863 --> 01:24:37,686
His daughter? Why did you never tell me.

981
01:24:40,153 --> 01:24:43,256
Bad enough if I had to kill
men for the confederacy,

982
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:46,462
I murdered a child for the union.

983
01:24:46,463 --> 01:24:48,263
It wasn't murder. You didn't know.

984
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:52,485
It doesn't matter to him.

985
01:24:54,622 --> 01:24:57,051
When he finishes what he is gonna do,

986
01:24:57,052 --> 01:25:00,047
you ride outta here and don't look back.

987
01:25:00,048 --> 01:25:02,631
I'm not leaving, now or ever.

988
01:25:04,036 --> 01:25:07,598
(Horse whickering)

989
01:25:07,599 --> 01:25:10,432
(Bird screeching)

990
01:25:12,604 --> 01:25:15,354
(Birds chirping)

991
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:23,367
(Men laughing)

992
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:26,118
(Birds chirping)

(Horse whickering)

01:25:55,461 --> 01:25:58,210
(Horse neighing)

996
01:25:59,984 --> 01:26:03,838
(Jeb and Hattie groaning)

997
01:26:03,839 --> 01:26:05,539
Well. Mrs. McAllister,

998
01:26:06,769 --> 01:26:08,692
pride goeth before a fall.

999
01:26:12,109 --> 01:26:15,168
(Men laughing)

1000
01:26:15,169 --> 01:26:20,168
Now, I think that you deserve
to have a front row seat

1001
01:26:20,358 --> 01:26:24,617
for this trial because of
your close relationship

1002
01:26:24,618 --> 01:26:25,941
with the accused.

1003
01:26:30,258 --> 01:26:32,031
Jebediah McAllister,

1004
01:26:33,828 --> 01:26:37,637
you are here by charged
with crimes against god

1005
01:26:37,638 --> 01:26:39,801
and the confederate states of america,

1006
01:26:40,788 --> 01:26:42,800
including a murder of a child.

1007
01:26:46,967 --> 01:26:47,990
How do you plead?

1008
01:26:50,147 --> 01:26:51,697
I have done what I have done.

1009
01:26:53,297 --> 01:26:54,897
You have heard the confession.

1010
01:26:56,957 --> 01:26:57,957
Don't hit my wife!

1011
01:27:00,017 --> 01:27:01,713
Gentlemen of the jury-

1012
01:27:01,714 --> 01:27:02,547
(Jeb groaning)
Wahoo!

1013
01:27:02,548 --> 01:27:04,456
How do you find the defendant?

1014
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:11,025
(Laughs) Guilty as hell, captain.

1015
01:27:11,026 --> 01:27:12,049
Guilty as hell.

1016
01:27:16,091 --> 01:27:17,535
(Men laughing)

1017
01:27:17,536 --> 01:27:19,173
You got no right.

1018
01:27:19,174 --> 01:27:20,007
(Blow thudding)

1019
01:27:20,008 --> 01:27:22,725
(Jeb growling)

1020
01:27:22,726 --> 01:27:24,979
Look what you have wrought, McAllister.

1021
01:27:27,405 --> 01:27:29,455
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

1022
01:27:31,286 --> 01:27:34,334
You don't give a damn what I have to say.

1023
01:27:34,335 --> 01:27:36,047
Go on, do what you gotta do.

1024
01:27:36,048 --> 01:27:37,215
No!

1025
01:27:39,275 --> 01:27:41,401
Are you familiar with the book of romans?

1026
01:27:41,402 --> 01:27:45,111
(Hattie screaming)

1027
01:27:45,112 --> 01:27:49,661
"For all, have sinned and
fallen short of the glory of god."

1028
01:27:50,984 --> 01:27:53,713
And I have no doubt
that god will forgive you-

1029
01:27:53,714 --> 01:27:54,547
no!

1030
01:27:54,548 --> 01:27:56,034
Through the blood of his son.

1031
01:28:00,434 --> 01:28:02,141
But I ain't god.

1032
01:28:02,142 --> 01:28:05,817
(Hattie screaming)

1033
01:28:05,818 --> 01:28:07,401
I'll do anything!

1034
01:28:08,594 --> 01:28:10,594
I said, I'd do anything!

1035
01:28:12,763 --> 01:28:13,763
Anything?

1036
01:28:16,634 --> 01:28:17,952
(Hattie panting)

1037
01:28:17,953 --> 01:28:19,036
Each man here.

1038

(Men laughing)

1039
01:28:21,973 --> 01:28:23,746
Entirely of your own free will.

1040
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:28,670
Hattie, no.

1041
01:28:30,253 --> 01:28:32,116
Well.
Not for me.

1042
01:28:33,478 --> 01:28:35,263
Hattie, no!
What do you say?

1043
01:28:35,264 --> 01:28:36,821
(Men laughing)

1044
01:28:36,822 --> 01:28:38,405
Hattie, no.

1045
01:28:39,475 --> 01:28:41,225
Don't do it!
Woo-ie!

1046
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:44,084
(Hattie groaning)

1047
01:28:44,085 --> 01:28:45,668
Hattie, no.

1048
01:28:46,826 --> 01:28:48,326
Don't do it, no!

1049
01:28:49,686 --> 01:28:50,686
Hattie!

1050
01:28:51,658 --> 01:28:55,025

(Cupboard thudding)
(Hattie groaning)

1053
01:29:01,274 --> 01:29:02,590
Now I expect you to conduct yourself

1054
01:29:02,591 --> 01:29:05,724
like a southern
gentleman in there. (Laughs)

1055
01:29:10,691 --> 01:29:13,930
I am going to allow you to watch your wife,

1056
01:29:13,931 --> 01:29:15,471
make herself into a whore

1057
01:29:17,951 --> 01:29:20,000
and then I'm gonna kill ya just the same.

1058
01:29:25,326 --> 01:29:28,409
(Long hair laughing)

1059
01:29:40,530 --> 01:29:44,696
Take off your gun belt
and leave it by the door.

1060
01:29:46,419 --> 01:29:48,319
I can put some perfume on if you like.

1061
01:29:50,769 --> 01:29:53,622
I got a bottle in just
last year from New York.

1062

rider which sat on him,

1068
01:30:34,537 --> 01:30:36,024
his name was death."

(Hattie whimpering)

1070
01:30:48,026 --> 01:30:49,789

(Gold tooth gurgling)
(Hattie panting)

1084

Hey, hurry it up in there.

1085
01:32:57,591 --> 01:33:01,764
My pecker's getting antsy. (Laughs)

1086

(Gun firing)

1087
01:33:08,808 --> 01:33:13,808
Son of a bitch shot me again! (Groaning)

1088
01:33:17,305 --> 01:33:19,948

Thank you, frank.

1109

You avenged her

as if she was yours.

1111

I'll walk with you

1163
