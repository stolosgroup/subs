00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:36,561
We know your time is valuable.

4
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,029
Thank you for holding.

5
00:01:40,702 --> 00:01:43,274
My name is William James Sharp.

6
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,235
You know, I've been...
I've been...

7
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,779
I've been trying to get someone
on the phone for weeks.

8
00:01:47,914 --> 00:01:49,408
Your number?

9
00:01:49,544 --> 00:01:52,043
Yeah. Let me see. Um...

10
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,117
It's, uh, TDZF73,

11
00:01:57,252 --> 00:01:59,259
uh, 4.

12
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:03,591
You can...
you can call me Will, please.

13
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:05,596
What's your name, ma'am?

14
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:07,763
- Supervisor 12.
- Supervi...

15
00:02:07,898 --> 00:02:10,264
That's funny. I...
You know, I-I talked to, uh...

16
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,632
to Supervisor 11 and 13.

17
00:02:12,768 --> 00:02:14,465
Well, I'm 12.

18
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,005
Not you. Okay.

19
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,144
I don't see your file here.

20
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,777
Okay. Just... Okay, slow down.

21
00:02:21,912 --> 00:02:23,975
Uh, all right, look,
my wife needs this surgery.

22
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:25,813
You need to call back, sir.

23
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:27,353
No. Well, ma'am,
that's the thing.

24
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:29,285
I can't... I can't get
a human on the phone.

25
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,784
Okay? It's always recordings

26
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,457
and numbers to push
for what I want.

27
00:02:32,592 --> 00:02:34,655
I just need to keep, uh,
a person on the phone,

28
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,295
you know, like,
a real human, so...

29
00:02:36,431 --> 00:02:37,797
I have to take my coffee break.

30
00:02:37,932 --> 00:02:39,359
This is real life.

31
00:02:39,495 --> 00:02:41,301
Okay? This is real life.

32
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:44,967
And I'm-I'm-I'm sorry
about your break, but...

33
00:02:45,102 --> 00:02:46,535
Fuck.

34
00:02:46,671 --> 00:02:48,031
You have a nice day.

35
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,975
No, ma'am, that's not...
that wasn't...

36
00:02:50,111 --> 00:02:51,642
Listen, okay? Hear me out.

37
00:02:51,777 --> 00:02:54,014
It's funny, I risked my life
for this country,

38
00:02:54,149 --> 00:02:56,041
- and it's...
- I'm sorry.

39
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,615
I wish I could help.

40
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,326
- Hey.
- Big Man Tate.

41
00:03:07,193 --> 00:03:09,120
Hey, did I wake him?

42
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:11,958
We got it, baby.

43
00:03:13,332 --> 00:03:14,996
Insurance coming through.

44
00:03:17,132 --> 00:03:20,334
I lose faith in this world
on a daily basis.

45
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,006
But not in you, though.

46
00:03:22,142 --> 00:03:23,871
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

47
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,841
Yeah, we're gonna be all right.

48
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:29,909
You think you could handle him
for a few hours?

49
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,514
Oh, yeah.
We're gonna sleep, right?

50
00:03:31,649 --> 00:03:33,187
Maybe not.

51
00:03:33,322 --> 00:03:34,547
Another interview?

52
00:03:34,683 --> 00:03:36,983
Uh, yeah. A warehouse job.

53
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,760
- A forklift driver.
- Ah.

54
00:03:39,895 --> 00:03:41,058
That's good, baby.

55
00:03:41,194 --> 00:03:42,860
You can drive anything.

56
00:03:42,995 --> 00:03:44,496
Yeah.

57
00:03:47,836 --> 00:03:49,061
All right.

58
00:03:51,997 --> 00:03:54,375
Celebrate when you get back.

59
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,541
Somebody called from
a blocked number earlier.

60
00:03:56,676 --> 00:03:58,201
I know what you're thinking.
It's not Danny.

61
00:03:58,337 --> 00:04:00,872
Good. I know you love him.
Don't know why.

62
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,246
But we don't need your brother.

63
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:04,741
I got all I need right here.

64
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:06,518
Turn on the alarm.

65
00:04:09,686 --> 00:04:11,248
Armed stay.

66
00:04:14,356 --> 00:04:16,055
Hey, I thought
you wanted to come see me.

67
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:18,090
- I'm on my way, Danny.
- Well, I'm tight on time.

68
00:04:35,047 --> 00:04:37,279
Unit 3, incident,
2515 accident in Downtown.

69
00:04:37,414 --> 00:04:39,084
Possible injuries.

70
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:40,747
Copy that. Coming in.

71
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:42,580
Floor it.

72
00:04:51,061 --> 00:04:52,922
All right, Unit 3.
Two minutes out. En route.

73
00:04:55,635 --> 00:04:57,266
ETA two minutes. You good?

74
00:04:57,402 --> 00:04:58,667
Copy. Yeah, I heard it.

75
00:04:58,802 --> 00:05:00,935
- Floor it.
- Fire says it's gnarly.

76
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,441
I haven't heard "gnarly"

77
00:05:03,577 --> 00:05:05,608
since I was surfing
gnarly waves.

78
00:05:05,744 --> 00:05:07,140
Unit 3, LAPD at scene.

79
00:05:07,275 --> 00:05:09,174
Be advised, child impaled,
critical condition.

80
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,411
Does it always sound that bad?

81
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:15,184
Here we go, here we go.

82
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,489
Oh, Jesus.

83
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:18,949
Oh, my God.

84
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,293
No matter what, stay focused.

85
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:21,289
Code three, incident.

86
00:05:21,424 --> 00:05:22,455
Copy. On scene.

87
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,992
Let's go.

88
00:05:29,105 --> 00:05:30,337
Let me see.

89
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:31,970
Stay clear, stay clear!
I need to check.

90
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:35,201
My baby.

91
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:38,168
Careful with the girl!
Move, move, move, move, move!

92
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:39,776
No, let me see her!

93
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:46,618
Is it still there?

94
00:05:48,186 --> 00:05:50,222
- I don't want to look at it.
- Hey, hey, sweetie, sweetie.

95
00:05:50,357 --> 00:05:51,555
Hey. Just got to look at me.

96
00:05:51,691 --> 00:05:52,985
You don't have to look
at it, okay?

97
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:54,395
- Right in my eyes. Good job.
- No.

98
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,890
Okay. I'm gonna take
a quick look at you.

99
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:57,495
- Let me know if anything hurts, okay?
- No.

100
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,060
Don't move.
Just use your words.

101
00:05:59,195 --> 00:06:00,495
Take a deep breath for me.

102
00:06:00,631 --> 00:06:02,025
Deep breath. Deep breath.

103
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,694
- Good job. Deeper.
- Ow, ow.

104
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:05,503
Good job.

105
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:08,008
Good job, good job.

106
00:06:08,143 --> 00:06:10,338
Okay, lungs are clear.

107
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:11,673
Scott! Scott.

108
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:13,370
- Holy...
- Set me up two bags...

109
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,171
Scott! Set me up two bags
in the rig. Quick!

110
00:06:15,307 --> 00:06:17,348
Where's my mommy?

111
00:06:17,484 --> 00:06:18,879
Mommy's outside. Mommy's okay.

112
00:06:19,015 --> 00:06:20,849
Mommy's okay.
What's your name?

113
00:06:20,984 --> 00:06:22,689
- Lindsey.
- Lindsey. My name is Cam.

114
00:06:22,824 --> 00:06:24,854
Give me your hand. Okay,
I'm gonna be helping you, okay?

115
00:06:24,989 --> 00:06:26,689
- Okay.
- Now, I need you to do something for me.

116
00:06:26,825 --> 00:06:28,253
Can you be brave?
Can you do that?

117
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,529
- I can be brave. Yeah.
- Okay, I knew you could.

118
00:06:30,664 --> 00:06:32,224
Okay, when you hear
that loud sound,

119
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,030
you're gonna squeeze my hand
really tight.

120
00:06:34,165 --> 00:06:36,431
And whatever happens,
you're not gonna let go, okay?

121
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:37,733
- Okay.
- Okay.

122
00:06:37,869 --> 00:06:38,872
- Go.

123
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:44,208
I'm right here. Lindsey.

124
00:06:44,343 --> 00:06:45,875
Lindsey. Lindsey.

125
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,207
I'm right here. I'm right here.
I'm right here.

126
00:06:51,686 --> 00:06:53,212
All units, 20-23, responding.

127
00:06:53,348 --> 00:06:55,550

128
00:06:55,685 --> 00:06:57,121
Oxygen in.

129
00:06:57,256 --> 00:06:58,349
Put it at eight.

130
00:06:59,357 --> 00:07:00,390
Both IVs going.

131
00:07:00,526 --> 00:07:02,120
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

132
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,561
The light was green.

133
00:07:03,697 --> 00:07:05,054
I didn't see anybody coming,
and I...

134
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,223
Ma'am, ma'am, look at me.

135
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,898
I need you to do
something for me.

136
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:10,468
Can you hold her hand? Okay?
Hold her hand. Good job.

137
00:07:10,603 --> 00:07:12,233
30 seconds out from Children's.

138
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:13,971
Just let them know to have

139
00:07:14,106 --> 00:07:15,908
- We're gonna need lots of blood stat.
- I already did.

140
00:07:16,043 --> 00:07:18,305
- I'm one step ahead of you.
- We're here. Okay, look at me.

141
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:20,107
Look at me. In three seconds,
the doors are gonna open.

142
00:07:20,242 --> 00:07:21,411
When we do that,
we're gonna bring her in.

143
00:07:21,547 --> 00:07:23,446
Don't let go of her, okay?

144
00:07:23,581 --> 00:07:25,080
Is she gonna be okay?

145
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:27,250
She's gonna be fine.
She's gonna be okay, okay?

146
00:07:27,385 --> 00:07:28,586
Thank you guys.

147
00:07:28,721 --> 00:07:29,917

148
00:07:30,053 --> 00:07:31,482
- Thank you.
- Got it. Watch the line.

149

00:07:34,894 --> 00:07:36,287
Tachycardia,

Hey. You all right? Is it...

00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,840
I'm starving.

158
00:07:49,975 --> 00:07:51,675
I know a good enchilada place.
Want to go?

00:07:51,811 --> 00:07:54,146
- En-Enchiladas?

160
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:55,678

<i>We've got barf bags.</i>

162
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:10,526
- What's up?
- What's up, homes?

163
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:12,625
I'm looking for Danny.

164
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,096
He in the back.

165
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,699
And don't touch nothing,
either, nigga.

166
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:21,938
For real.

167
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:48,360
You're not supposed
to be in here.

168
00:08:50,136 --> 00:08:52,062
Rich people don't like it
when you envy their shit.

169
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,500
It makes them feel guilty.

170
00:08:53,635 --> 00:08:54,833
Good.

171
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:56,341
What's with the 'Vette?

172
00:08:56,476 --> 00:08:58,371
Which one?

173
00:08:58,507 --> 00:09:01,377
'50s hit job. Some lawyer
outside of a courthouse.

174
00:09:01,512 --> 00:09:02,845
Original.

175
00:09:02,981 --> 00:09:04,549
Makes them worth a lot...
I don't know.

176
00:09:04,685 --> 00:09:06,175
And they hire you
to protect it.

177
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:07,747
- Yeah.
- What up, Danny?

178
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,022
The hero returns.

179
00:09:09,157 --> 00:09:10,355
Good to see you.

180
00:09:10,491 --> 00:09:12,582
- Yeah, you, too.
- Yeah?

181
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,894
- You look tired. You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

182
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,530
For a second, I thought
you weren't gonna call me.

183
00:09:16,665 --> 00:09:17,691
Yeah, family stuff.
I got hung up.

184
00:09:17,827 --> 00:09:19,593
How's Big Man Tate?

185
00:09:19,728 --> 00:09:21,562
He's good. Loud.

186
00:09:21,697 --> 00:09:23,201
How's Amy?

187
00:09:23,336 --> 00:09:24,897
She's cool.

188
00:09:26,706 --> 00:09:28,241
- You want coffee?
- Nah.

189
00:09:28,377 --> 00:09:29,575
Let me make you a coffee.

190
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,204
I have one of those
Keurig things.

191
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:32,904
They're new. You want it?
It's good.

192
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,377
Yeah? You want one?

193
00:09:34,512 --> 00:09:35,546
Yeah, sure.

194
00:09:35,681 --> 00:09:37,112
Boss finally splurged on us.

195
00:09:37,248 --> 00:09:38,711
Hey, will you tell him
to get off the phone?

196
00:09:38,847 --> 00:09:39,911
What is this?

197
00:09:42,051 --> 00:09:43,455
What are you doing, Randazzo?

198
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,720
Ah, my wife's breaking my balls.

199
00:09:44,856 --> 00:09:46,053
What are you on the phone for?

200
00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:47,725
- Let's go!
- I can't do this shit.

201
00:09:47,861 --> 00:09:49,222
Just come on.
Sit down, all right?

202
00:09:49,357 --> 00:09:50,428
Sit down.
You're making me anxious.

203
00:09:50,564 --> 00:09:52,732
Enjoy my break room. Here.

204
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,570
It's good coffee, huh?

205
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:01,740
Yeah, great. Uh, look, man.

206
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:05,412
You can definitely, uh,
tell me to go eff off,

207
00:10:05,547 --> 00:10:08,815
but, uh, I could use some help.

208
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,818
Yeah, when you need something,
you call me, huh?

209
00:10:11,953 --> 00:10:14,611
Okay, yes,
I'm here because I need help.

210
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:16,988
I know there was shit
between you and LT.

211
00:10:17,123 --> 00:10:19,419
I know you and Dad had shit.
I had shit with Dad.

212
00:10:19,555 --> 00:10:21,328
None of that changed anything
between you and me.

213
00:10:21,463 --> 00:10:22,590
At least, I didn't think so.

214
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:24,624
I love you, bro.

215
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,290
Okay?

216
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,965
And I miss you,
but let's not...

217
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,770
Let's just... let's just
call it what it is, man.

218
00:10:31,906 --> 00:10:33,932
I left because that life
wasn't good for me.

219
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,765
How is that right?

220
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,009
You put your life down
on the line for this country.

221
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:39,945
You leave your family,
your home, you miss your kid

222
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:41,610
being born, and what did they
give you in return?

223
00:10:41,746 --> 00:10:43,340
It gave me purpose.

224
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:45,613
I knew what I was getting into.

225
00:10:45,748 --> 00:10:46,943
It's good.

226
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:48,947
Yeah.

227
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,648
Is that Dad's watch?

228
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,792
Yeah. I found it when I was
cleaning out his house.

229
00:10:53,927 --> 00:10:56,119
You didn't show,
so I just... I took it.

230
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,861
Yo, check this out.

231
00:10:57,996 --> 00:10:59,858
Look what I found.

232
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:01,592
Look at this.

233
00:11:02,502 --> 00:11:03,935
Dad's booties.

234
00:11:07,772 --> 00:11:09,034
Look at these pictures.

235
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,968
- You and me.
- Hmm.

236
00:11:29,358 --> 00:11:31,156
Look at you.
And who's that? Wait.

237
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,623
Wh-What class is that? Um...

238
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:35,692
Ah, Ms. Burns.

239
00:11:38,805 --> 00:11:40,367
Ms. Burns.

240
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:43,503
Yeah, right after you stood up,
embarrassed me

241
00:11:43,638 --> 00:11:45,673
and told the whole class
that your family took me in.

242
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:48,371
I owe your family a lot.

243
00:11:48,506 --> 00:11:50,180
- It's our family.
- Yeah.

244
00:11:50,315 --> 00:11:52,885
Maybe one day, you'll let me
see my nephew, yeah?

245
00:11:56,821 --> 00:11:58,550
How much do you need?

246
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:01,394
- 231.
- Mm-hmm.

247
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:04,027
Experimental surgery.

248
00:12:04,163 --> 00:12:05,865
Except insurance doesn't
cover experimental

249
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,164
because, they tell me,
it's experimental.

250
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:14,198
How about more?

251
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:15,842
Is this the guy?

252
00:12:17,342 --> 00:12:20,045
- No, it's not the guy, Mel.
- That's not my name.

253
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,880
Yes, it is. It's Mel Gibson.
That's your name.

254
00:12:22,016 --> 00:12:23,543
- It's not my name.
- Well, it should be.

255
00:12:23,678 --> 00:12:24,617
- No, I'm not the guy.
- You look like Mel Gibson,

256
00:12:24,752 --> 00:12:26,049
like from that movie <i>Braveheart.</i>

257
00:12:26,185 --> 00:12:27,413
It's, like,
one of my favorite movies.

258
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:29,055
Yeah, I get...
I get the reference, man.

259
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,054
It's a great movie. It won,
like, a lot of Grammy...

260
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,449
Doesn't he look like that...
that guy?

261
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,557
Don't you have somewhere to go?

262
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:35,888
Yeah, we all do.

263
00:12:43,432 --> 00:12:45,430
So who's this new dude
he's got, man?

264
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:47,097
I don't like rolling
with new dudes.

265
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,072
Hey, guys. Let's go.
Get those boxes outside.

266
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,810
What the fuck are you doing?

267
00:12:51,946 --> 00:12:54,239
Danny, you told me
you were done.

268
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,740
I was then, but this is now.

269
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,277
First Federal Downtown,
32 million.

270
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:02,753
I have this wired.

271
00:13:02,888 --> 00:13:04,621
What? No banks hold $32 million.

272
00:13:04,757 --> 00:13:06,156
I know. It's a one-off.

273
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:07,921
A fuckup 'cause the feds
are vacuuming up paper.

274
00:13:08,057 --> 00:13:09,452
But I need another man.

275
00:13:09,587 --> 00:13:11,491
Four inside and one driver.

276
00:13:11,626 --> 00:13:13,094
Feds are moving it out tonight
after hours.

277
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:14,493
We get in there now, it's ours.

278
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:16,767
- No. Jesus, Danny.
- It's ours.

279
00:13:16,902 --> 00:13:18,905
Hey. This is extraordinary.

280
00:13:21,609 --> 00:13:23,003
Let's go. Five minutes.

281
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:24,643
Yo!

282
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:26,445
That is an ugly beast. Ugh.

283
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:27,980
It's a ground-up build.

284
00:13:28,116 --> 00:13:29,649
Swapped out the engine
for a six Cummins 550.

285
00:13:29,784 --> 00:13:31,809
- Should roll nicely.
- Nice.

286
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,820
You want to make some
deliveries while you're out,

287
00:13:33,956 --> 00:13:35,822
no one's gonna stop you.

288
00:13:35,957 --> 00:13:37,682
Hey. Please thank Papi
for me, yeah?

289
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,121
- He knows. Be safe, huh?
- All right. All right.

290
00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:41,827
Hey, Will. Come check this out.

291
00:13:41,963 --> 00:13:43,190
Danny, why aren't we
taking our car?

292
00:13:43,326 --> 00:13:45,022
The Mercedes is faster.
Come on.

293
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,956
Because this can be tracked
and this is clean. All right?

294
00:13:47,091 --> 00:13:48,959
Plus, we'll look like clowns
coming out of that car.

295
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,001
Do you even know how to get
to the fucking bank? No.

296
00:13:51,137 --> 00:13:52,639
So it's my city,
my rules, my job.

297
00:13:52,774 --> 00:13:53,837
Just listen to that, all right?

298
00:13:53,972 --> 00:13:54,968
- Who is this guy?
- What?

299
00:13:55,104 --> 00:13:56,676
That's my brother Will.

300
00:13:56,811 --> 00:13:58,670
Doesn't look like your brother.

301
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:02,305
Oh, wow. That is original.

302
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:03,650
Yeah. It's original.

303
00:14:03,785 --> 00:14:05,012
I'm just saying.

304
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:07,179
Hey, where are you going?

305
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,516
Hey, Will. What's up?

306
00:14:09,652 --> 00:14:11,221
- What's going on?
- I came to you for a loan.

307
00:14:11,356 --> 00:14:13,356
Maybe... maybe a small job,
at the least.

308
00:14:13,492 --> 00:14:15,390
- Not this.
- Look. All right, look, I don't have it.

309
00:14:15,526 --> 00:14:17,222
Everything I have
is tied up in this score.

310
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:18,690
All right? And it's tight.

311
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:20,492
Look, I-I can't...
I-I-I need your help.

312
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:22,063
I can't do this alone.
I need you.

313
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:23,502
I can't do this with Mel Gibson.

314
00:14:23,637 --> 00:14:24,837
I can't do it. No.

315
00:14:24,972 --> 00:14:26,665
"Is this the guy?"
I'm not stupid.

316
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,240
Neither am I.
Dad was a fucking psycho.

317
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,375
I know that. You know that.
Even the FBI knows that.

318
00:14:30,511 --> 00:14:32,877
But I'm not him. Look, have I
ever gotten you into anything

319
00:14:33,012 --> 00:14:34,380
that I couldn't get you out of?

320
00:14:34,516 --> 00:14:36,013
Anything? No.

321
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:37,844
- Yes.
- The guns are for...

322
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:39,581
Hey, hey, the guns are for...
Come on, what-what do you...

323
00:14:39,717 --> 00:14:41,550
What do you want me to say?
What-what are we gonna do?

324
00:14:41,686 --> 00:14:43,354
We're gonna... "Oh, please,
can we please have some..."

325
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,881
What, are we gonna fake it?
No, dude, we have real guns.

326
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,587
It's just for protection.
You know how it works.

327
00:14:46,722 --> 00:14:48,526
We're not cowboys.
We're not shooting anything up.

328
00:14:48,661 --> 00:14:50,357
This is my job.

329
00:14:50,493 --> 00:14:52,424
Come on.
We can do this in our sleep.

330
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,861
Danny, let's roll.

331
00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:55,434
All right!

332
00:14:55,569 --> 00:14:57,200
One second!

333
00:14:57,336 --> 00:14:59,031
Fuck!

334
00:15:00,034 --> 00:15:01,868
Bang-up crew that you dragged me into, Danny.

335
00:15:02,004 --> 00:15:03,538
See, that's what I like about
you, though. That's what I...

336
00:15:03,674 --> 00:15:05,542
- I like the shit you give me.
- It's a bang-up crew

337
00:15:05,677 --> 00:15:06,945
- you dragged me into, Danny.
- I like the shit.

338
00:15:07,081 --> 00:15:09,039
Everyone's gonna love
Uncle Danny.

339
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,248
I mean, I'm gonna be over back
for turkey, Christmas.

340
00:15:11,384 --> 00:15:12,951
Your second-born is gonna
be named after me.

341
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:14,450
I mean, Danny works
for both sexes.

342
00:15:14,585 --> 00:15:16,248
- This is not funny.
- It works for both sexes.

343
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:17,882
It's not funny, Danny.

344
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,384
Look, we've got five minutes,
and I need to know

345
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,217
whether you're in or you're out.

346
00:15:21,352 --> 00:15:22,959
You're my brother. I love you.
I will do anything for you,

347
00:15:23,095 --> 00:15:24,292
and all I'm asking is for you

348
00:15:24,428 --> 00:15:25,623
to do this one
little thing for me.

349
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,133
And now you're here
on my doorstep

350
00:15:27,268 --> 00:15:29,063
asking me for help,
and what am I giving you?

351
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,895
I am giving you the world!

352
00:15:32,902 --> 00:15:34,404
Listen.

353
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:36,475
It's time for you
to do something for yourself.

354
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,374
For your family.

355
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:41,014
For your family.

356
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,382
Whoa.

357
00:15:48,446 --> 00:15:49,756
God, I'm broke.

358
00:15:49,891 --> 00:15:51,081
Here you go. Your latte.

359
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:52,582
Really?

360
00:15:52,717 --> 00:15:54,126
Drinking a beer on the job?

361
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:56,429
So you were a little
traumatized after all.

362
00:15:58,229 --> 00:15:59,763
- Zero alcohol, dude.
- Oh.

363
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:01,993
Heard from dispatch.

364
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,300
Little girl from earlier,
Lindsey, she's gonna make it.

365
00:16:05,436 --> 00:16:07,838
- I, uh, figured you'd want to know.
- No.

366
00:16:07,974 --> 00:16:09,765
- No?
- No, Scott.

367
00:16:09,901 --> 00:16:11,937
- I don't want to know.
- What?

368
00:16:12,073 --> 00:16:14,511
No, I saw the way you-you
handled the whole situation.

369
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:16,676
And you were just so calm
and cool. I was freaking out.

370
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:18,447
That's why I want to do
this job, you know?

371
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:19,943
Scott, Scott,
I'm gonna give you some advice

372
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:21,454
'cause you're new
and you talk too much.

373
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,986
Yeah, I-I do.

374
00:16:23,122 --> 00:16:24,286
It's just a job. Nothing else.

375
00:16:24,422 --> 00:16:26,149
You pick 'em up,
drop 'em, forget it.

376
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,990
The worst day of their lives
is just your Tuesday afternoon.

377
00:16:29,993 --> 00:16:32,822
Ah. I see what they say about
you is true. That's a bummer.

378
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,794
What, you're just
gonna drop that?

379
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,530
Oh, you want me to take
the bait. Okay. Give it to me.

380
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,204
You're the best paramedic
in town,

381
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,870
you can keep anyone alive
for 20 minutes...

382
00:16:41,006 --> 00:16:42,504
20 minutes. Mm-hmm.

383
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,677
...and no one wants
to be your partner.

384
00:16:44,813 --> 00:16:46,772
I already did my research.

385
00:16:48,845 --> 00:16:53,011
Well, there's definitely
something wrong with me, Scott.

386
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,715
Okay, maybe I'm just trying
to get to know you.

387
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,519
You think about that?
So we don't have to sit

388
00:16:57,654 --> 00:16:59,189
in that car
and be awkward the whole time.

389
00:16:59,324 --> 00:17:00,819
Like what kind of music
I'm into.

390
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,654
I feel like I may have said
something too much,

391
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,997
so I'm just gonna rewind,

392
00:17:07,132 --> 00:17:09,160
retract a little bit here, okay?

393
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:11,837
We could maybe take a picture
at the end of the day. Uh...

394
00:17:11,972 --> 00:17:14,374
Scott, just eat your sushi.

395
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:15,968
Okay.

396
00:17:17,138 --> 00:17:20,847
Um, I'm from Thousand Oaks,
but I was raised in Tarzana.

397
00:17:20,982 --> 00:17:22,576
- My dad...
- Wow. Tarzana.

398
00:17:22,712 --> 00:17:25,182
Wait, hold up.
So you don't know her name?

399
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:27,048
I do know her name.
Her name's Kim.

400
00:17:27,184 --> 00:17:28,348
- Kim?
- Yeah.

401
00:17:28,484 --> 00:17:30,851
Okay, so did you ask Kim out?

402
00:17:30,987 --> 00:17:32,355
No.

403
00:17:32,491 --> 00:17:34,556
But I'm seeing her
across the bank, right?

404
00:17:34,692 --> 00:17:37,428
And there's energy flying.
And it's electric.

405
00:17:37,564 --> 00:17:39,530
And I'm just kind of waiting
for that right moment.

406
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,859
Zach, we've been to the same
bank three times this week.

407
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:43,935
I thought you were just
shitty with money.

408
00:17:44,071 --> 00:17:45,729
Keep getting the wrong teller.

409
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,437
- The wrong teller?
- So, yeah.

410
00:17:47,572 --> 00:17:49,370
<i>What are you doing?</i>

411
00:17:49,506 --> 00:17:50,902
<i>We're going back.</i>

412
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:52,037
<i>Romantics,
they don't get the girl...</i>

413
00:17:52,173 --> 00:17:53,936
at all.

414
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:55,743
You remember
when Sean Connery said,

415
00:17:55,878 --> 00:17:58,875
"Losers whine, winners get
to fuck the prom queen"?

416
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,710
- Hmm?
- That was super aggressive.

417
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:03,446
No, I don't remember that.

418
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,957
<i>The Rock?</i>

419
00:18:06,093 --> 00:18:08,584
The Rock? Yeah, he's an actor.

420
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,592
He was a wrestler first.

421
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:33,248
Fucking L.A. drivers.

422
00:18:33,383 --> 00:18:35,551
Drive like a bunch of mamalukes.

423
00:18:41,394 --> 00:18:43,258
By the way,
who wears Birkenstocks

424
00:18:43,393 --> 00:18:44,956
to-to a bank robbery, Trent?

425
00:18:46,395 --> 00:18:48,234
I do.

426
00:18:58,141 --> 00:18:59,942
We're set, guys.

427
00:19:00,077 --> 00:19:01,471
You okay?

428
00:19:01,606 --> 00:19:03,348
I'm okay.

429
00:19:03,483 --> 00:19:05,441
He don't fucking look okay
to me, Danny.

430
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:08,279
I'm not sure soldier boy here
would hack it back in Brooklyn.

431
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,455
- How bad you want to find out?
- All right, all right.

432
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:12,482
He's seen more action
than all of you, all right?

433
00:19:12,617 --> 00:19:13,820
Let's get ready.

434
00:19:15,293 --> 00:19:17,487
We're gonna rock this today.

435
00:19:27,342 --> 00:19:29,467
Let's get ready to roll, boys.

436
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:31,470
Pull your balls out.

437
00:19:31,606 --> 00:19:33,279
We're going to war, baby.

438
00:19:40,018 --> 00:19:41,485
We're here.

439
00:20:02,507 --> 00:20:04,376
Let's go, let's go.

440
00:21:03,202 --> 00:21:04,564
Out of the car, boot.

441
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:05,632
I got an idea.

442
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:07,302
We go in together like <i>Bad Boys.</i>

443
00:21:07,438 --> 00:21:09,408
Out of the car.

444
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,776
No Benz. I'm not sure
if they switched rides.

445
00:21:17,084 --> 00:21:19,110
What's this guy doing?

446
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:22,212
It might get stupid here
real quick.

447
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,255
- What do you got?
- So I got this guy in a delivery truck

448
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,098
wearing sunglasses
down in the parking garage.

449
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:34,625
So this might be going down now.

450
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:37,128
Are your boys ready?

451
00:21:38,737 --> 00:21:40,105
Come on, buddy.

452
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:41,939
You wait, Nitro. You hear me?

453
00:21:42,074 --> 00:21:43,601
You wait. Yeah?

454
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:45,501
Amigos, no Mercedes.

455
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,771
Well, shit. I thought we had
a tracker on the Mercedes.

456
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:49,339
What happened to that?

457
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,812
- It hasn't moved yet.
- Goddamn it.

458
00:21:50,947 --> 00:21:52,942
They could be
inside the bank, boss.

459
00:21:53,077 --> 00:21:54,515
You want us to hit 'em now?

460
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,185
No, that'll be a bloodbath.

461
00:21:56,321 --> 00:21:57,648
You drop 'em later.

462
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,581
Okay? You hear me?

463
00:22:00,584 --> 00:22:03,319
And you wait till we get
to the dog park. Ugh, buddy.

464
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:08,159
What's going on?

465
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:10,601
The building's locked.

466
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,497
Why is it locked?

467
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,304
I don't know why it's locked,
but it's locked. Hold on.

468
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,536
Manager's coming up.

469
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:19,508
"Hey, Kim. Howdy."

470
00:22:19,643 --> 00:22:21,342
What can I do you for, Officer?

471
00:22:21,478 --> 00:22:23,209
Uh, why are you closed?

472
00:22:23,345 --> 00:22:25,207
Oh, we're just doing a transfer
in the back. It's procedure.

473
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:27,049
- Okay.
- You worried me for a second.

474
00:22:27,184 --> 00:22:28,685
- I saw you talking to yourself in the mirror.
- Oh.

475
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,214
Yeah, you know,
I was thinking about

476
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,524
starting a savings account.

477
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:35,393
Oh, nice. We've got some great
junior accounts.

478
00:22:35,528 --> 00:22:37,220
- I'll let you in in 20 minutes.
- Yeah?

479
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,695
You know what, though,
'cause, um...

480
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,328
if I could just get it done
real quick,

481
00:22:40,464 --> 00:22:41,993
'cause I'm on the clock.

482
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:44,661
Uh, promise not
to rob the place.

483
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:47,536
- What do you think?
- Promise?

484
00:22:47,671 --> 00:22:49,035
- I won't rob it.
- Seriously.

485
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,675
'Cause that would be bad
for my job, you know.

486
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,204
- I promise.
- All right, okay. All right.

487
00:22:52,339 --> 00:22:53,974
- All right, come on in. Okay.
- Okay. All right.

488
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,050
Thought I'd give you a try.

489
00:22:59,186 --> 00:23:00,585
I saw your commercials.

490
00:23:00,721 --> 00:23:02,048
- Really emotional.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

491
00:23:02,184 --> 00:23:03,854
Yeah, the one with
the airplane and the dog.

492
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,424
- I mean, gets me every time.
- Yeah, that was really cute.

493
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,019
Well, I'm sure Big Bob
can help you over here.

494
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:09,528
Uh, I can help you
right over here.

495
00:23:09,663 --> 00:23:11,390
- Oh, that's-that's okay.
- Yes, sir.

496
00:23:11,525 --> 00:23:14,023
Can the woman next
to him help me out? Over there.

497
00:23:14,158 --> 00:23:16,062
Uh, I think her name is Kim.

498
00:23:16,197 --> 00:23:19,028
Kim? Could you just
tell me her last name?

499
00:23:19,163 --> 00:23:20,740
I just want to be thorough.

500
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,200
Uh...

501
00:23:22,335 --> 00:23:24,536
- Last name. Her-her name.
- Sorry, what?

502
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,202
Her full name.

503
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,440
- Kim?
- Uh, yeah. Just, Kim who?

504
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,213
Park.

505
00:23:30,348 --> 00:23:32,117
Park. Okay, swell.

506
00:23:32,252 --> 00:23:33,582
Okay, Kim's fantastic.

507
00:23:33,717 --> 00:23:35,114
Kim, you have a visitor.

508
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:37,054
Make it quick.

509
00:23:37,189 --> 00:23:38,923
Hi. Hello.

510
00:23:39,058 --> 00:23:40,218
Um...

511
00:23:41,728 --> 00:23:43,859
This is gonna sound
a little crazy, uh...

512
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,961
- What is it?
- Well, I-I've...

513
00:23:47,097 --> 00:23:50,401
I've been in here
in the bank a few times...

514
00:23:50,536 --> 00:23:52,571
Wow, it's really
just me in here.

515
00:23:52,707 --> 00:23:55,298
Um, uh, I-I was personally
gonna... gonna try

516
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,574
and play it a little cooler,
but my...

517
00:23:57,709 --> 00:23:59,270
my-my partner in there,
you see...

518
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:01,271
He's right out there
in this... in the car.

519
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:03,241
He just wanted me
to come in and...

520
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:05,241
say something to you,
'cause I told myself

521
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,944
that if I ever got
the chance to,

522
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,955
that I would ask you out...

523
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,557
on a date.

524
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,590
Like, right now?

525
00:24:15,726 --> 00:24:17,121
Doesn't have to be.

526
00:24:17,257 --> 00:24:18,824
Could...
It-it could be another time.

527
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:21,165
Maybe this weekend or something.

528
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,163
Um, but obviously,

529
00:24:23,298 --> 00:24:25,434
it doesn't seem like
a great time...

530
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:28,431
right now, so I, uh...

531
00:24:32,641 --> 00:24:34,312
Hey, are you okay?

532
00:24:34,448 --> 00:24:36,539
Fucked up the name, didn't I?

533
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,480
No. Uh-uh-uh-uh. I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

534
00:24:39,616 --> 00:24:41,015
No, no, no, no, no.

535
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,821
These are the decisions
that matter in life,

536
00:24:42,957 --> 00:24:44,621
so let me give you all the
information before you decide.

537
00:24:44,757 --> 00:24:46,450
Okay, I have two guns,
fully auto.

538
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,521
One's aimed at you,
and the other one's at Kim,

539
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:50,290
your girlfriend.

540
00:24:50,425 --> 00:24:51,960
I have you, the tellers,
and nine employees in the back,

541
00:24:52,096 --> 00:24:53,663
and your partner outside,
and it's up to you

542
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:55,366
to make sure
that they are all safe.

543
00:24:55,502 --> 00:24:57,968
Yeah, kind of a heavy burden.

544
00:24:59,004 --> 00:25:01,332
I need you to nod
if you understand, Officer.

545
00:25:05,603 --> 00:25:07,009
Now, take your fucking hand
off the weapon.

546
00:25:07,144 --> 00:25:10,275
Give me a big smile
and wave at your partner.

547
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,310
There you go.
Yeah, there you go.

548
00:25:14,445 --> 00:25:17,046
- Yeah. All right.
- Fuck.

549
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:19,322
Let's go, D. Let's go.

550
00:25:19,457 --> 00:25:20,689
$32 million, guys.

551
00:25:20,824 --> 00:25:22,155
It's all yours. Please take it.

552
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:23,857
We don't want any problems.
I'm out of here.

553
00:25:23,993 --> 00:25:25,728
- Hey.
- Hello, sir. Yes, sir.

554
00:25:25,864 --> 00:25:27,159
Million per block, man.
You ever seen

555
00:25:27,295 --> 00:25:28,826
any shit like this
in Afghanistan, brother?

556
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:30,402
Once.

557
00:25:30,537 --> 00:25:32,068
I was giving it to the Taliban.

558
00:25:33,341 --> 00:25:34,834
Hey, work fast.

559
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,842
My wife's gonna be very happy.

560
00:25:36,978 --> 00:25:38,503
Whoa...

561
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:40,511
Yep.

562
00:25:40,647 --> 00:25:42,714
Eight million per bag.

563
00:25:50,821 --> 00:25:52,754
Hey, pick up the radio, dude.

564
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:54,683
Been out here so long. Come on.

565
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,359
You've got
nothing to do all fucking day

566
00:25:56,494 --> 00:25:57,723
but bust my balls.

567
00:25:57,859 --> 00:25:59,027
I told you I'm busy.

568
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:01,728
Yeah, I'm glad
you're taking a bath.

569
00:26:01,864 --> 00:26:03,163
I hope you fucking drown.

570
00:26:07,507 --> 00:26:08,898
Babycakes, kiss the kids.

571
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:10,433
I got to go now.

572
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,875
Oh, fuck.
There's a cop around front.

573
00:26:16,377 --> 00:26:18,781
God, this fucking truck.

574
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:20,884
Son of a bitch!

575
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:22,113
Randazzo, let's roll.

576
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,546
- Here we go.
- It's down.

577
00:26:24,557 --> 00:26:25,789
Pig's not working, Danny.

578
00:26:25,924 --> 00:26:28,060
I told you this thing's
a f-fucking pig,

579
00:26:28,196 --> 00:26:29,926
piece of shit.

580
00:26:31,364 --> 00:26:32,893
Fuck. He's coming.

581
00:26:33,028 --> 00:26:34,758
Yeah, the copper's coming over.

582
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:39,068
Let me see... let me see if I
can bullshit this fucking guy.

583
00:26:39,203 --> 00:26:42,068
- Oh, how you doing, Officer?
- Hey there. No go?

584
00:26:42,203 --> 00:26:44,070
Yeah, you know
the way these trucks...

585
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:46,536
they're funny sometimes,
you know?

586
00:26:48,577 --> 00:26:49,780
Trent!

587
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:52,109
Why are you using
my real name, dude?

588
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:53,775
What the hell are you doing?

589
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:55,253
- Shopping for my girlfriend.
- Leave the lady alone.

590
00:26:55,388 --> 00:26:57,220
Let's go, dumbass.

591
00:26:58,223 --> 00:27:00,550
He's not swearing at you,
Vivian. He's just a dick.

592
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:04,423
Ooh!

593
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,095
- That's a nice-looking engine.
- I got him in front.

594
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,096
Should I fucking kill him?
Should I run him over?

595
00:27:11,132 --> 00:27:13,000
We're gonna leave one by one.

596
00:27:13,136 --> 00:27:15,499
Nobody raise their head.
Do not get up!

597
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:18,601
You are almost there.
You are almost there.

598
00:27:19,744 --> 00:27:21,113
Try it now.

599
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:23,809
All right, what do you know,
Officer?

600
00:27:23,944 --> 00:27:25,277
You saved the day.

601
00:27:25,413 --> 00:27:27,179
Sometimes you just
got to look at her.

602
00:27:27,315 --> 00:27:28,519
Officer Ranshaw,
I'm gonna drop you off

603
00:27:28,654 --> 00:27:30,152
one of my mother's cannolis.

604
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:31,817
- You have a great day. God bless you.
- All right.

605
00:27:31,953 --> 00:27:34,089
Thank you, Officer.

606
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:38,995
Randazzo!

607
00:27:40,131 --> 00:27:42,290
You are all gonna have
the greatest story

608
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:43,664
to tell at dinner tonight.

609
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,297
Hey, you! Stay down!

610
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:46,634
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Come on.

611
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,135
Let's go! Let's go!

612
00:27:48,271 --> 00:27:49,775
Randazzo, it's time to party,
brother.

613
00:27:54,845 --> 00:27:58,113
Fuck. What's taking him so long?

614
00:27:59,651 --> 00:28:00,982
Let's go. Let's go.

615
00:28:01,117 --> 00:28:02,447
- Let's go.
- Move, move, move, move.

616
00:28:04,953 --> 00:28:06,823
Shit. Get down! Get out!

617
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:08,618
Move, move, move! Come on!

618
00:28:12,499 --> 00:28:14,294
Ah, you motherfucker!

619
00:28:16,132 --> 00:28:17,895
Come on! Fuck!

620
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,336
Get outside!

621
00:28:19,471 --> 00:28:20,703
Get outside now!

622
00:28:23,371 --> 00:28:24,704
- It's go time.
- Oh, shit. Let's go.

623
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:26,306
Shit. Get SWAT.

624
00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:40,826
- S.I.S.! S.I.S.!
- S.I.S.!

625
00:28:42,186 --> 00:28:43,686
Randazzo!

626
00:28:45,864 --> 00:28:47,899
Wrong door!

627
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,262
Go, go, go, go! Mel!

628
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:52,662
Mel Gibson, go!
Don't shoot a cop!

629
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:56,666
Ah, you idiot! Come on!

630
00:29:02,247 --> 00:29:05,417
Go, go, go, go, go!
Get down! Down, down, down!

631
00:29:05,553 --> 00:29:07,582
Come on, come on, come on!

632
00:29:07,718 --> 00:29:09,046
Come on, Will.

633
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:10,412
Where's Randazzo?

634
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,280
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

635
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:13,721
Let's go, Will. Come on!

636
00:29:13,857 --> 00:29:15,355
Move!

637
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:28,731
Ah, fuck you! Fuck you!

638
00:29:28,866 --> 00:29:31,041
Randazzo, what the fuck
are you doing, man?

639
00:29:35,946 --> 00:29:37,707
- S.I.S.! S.I.S.!
- S.I.S.!

640
00:29:57,902 --> 00:29:59,603
Split, split, split, split.

641
00:29:59,739 --> 00:30:00,772
All right, what?

642
00:30:00,907 --> 00:30:01,835
Let's talk about the job.

643
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,137
No, this is great.

644
00:30:03,273 --> 00:30:04,101
I feel like
we're really connecting.

645
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:05,302
You know what, fine.

646
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:06,935
I'll just put in for a transfer.

647
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,438
All right, you get
one question a day. That's it.

648
00:30:09,573 --> 00:30:11,143
Boyfriend... do you have one?

649
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:12,615
Of course you're gonna ask that.

650
00:30:12,751 --> 00:30:13,948
Yes, I have a boyfriend.

651
00:30:14,084 --> 00:30:15,320
He's a doctor at Mount Sinai.

652
00:30:17,121 --> 00:30:18,323
- What was that?
- Automatic guns.

653
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:19,615
Oh, shit.

654
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:20,658
Unit 3, shots fired.

655
00:30:20,793 --> 00:30:21,956
First National Bank, Grand.

656
00:30:22,091 --> 00:30:23,152
Copy. We're on the go. Let's go!

657
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:24,661
Move, Scott!

658
00:30:24,797 --> 00:30:26,261
I'm going!

659
00:30:41,815 --> 00:30:43,808
Oh, shit.

660
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:48,283
Be advised, I'm going in.
They've got my partner.

661
00:30:58,963 --> 00:31:00,526
Let's go!

662
00:31:03,636 --> 00:31:05,300
You fucking move!

663
00:31:20,817 --> 00:31:22,350
Contact, front!

664
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,064
Oh, shit!

665
00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:54,948
- You're fucked up, man!
- I'm good.

666
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:57,051
Goddamn it. Shit.

667
00:31:57,187 --> 00:31:59,221
Oh, shit.

668
00:31:59,357 --> 00:32:01,088
You shouldn't have worn
fucking sandals, dude.

669
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:03,125
What did you do to my legs?

670
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,257
Shit!

671
00:32:04,392 --> 00:32:05,422
Go! Fucking move!

672
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:07,593
Hey, let's go.

673
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,901
- You crushed him, man!
- Who cares? Get his bag.

674
00:32:12,036 --> 00:32:13,398
He was at your wedding, bro!

675
00:32:13,534 --> 00:32:16,041
Come on!

676
00:32:18,912 --> 00:32:20,540
It's getting tight.

677
00:32:22,713 --> 00:32:24,743
- Fuck, we're stuck. Goddamn it.
- Hey! What's happening?

678
00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:27,251
- Who's shooting? Randazzo? Mel?
- Will, stop it. Will.

679
00:32:27,386 --> 00:32:29,087
- Mel? Mel? Randazzo?
- Will, just forget about it.

680
00:32:29,222 --> 00:32:30,749
- Who-who is shooting?
- Will, forget about it.

681
00:32:30,884 --> 00:32:32,919
Just fucking stop!
Will, just forget about it!

682
00:32:33,055 --> 00:32:34,954
Hey, hey, hey!

683
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:38,294
Hey, get back! Hey, hey!

684
00:32:45,066 --> 00:32:46,137
Oh, shit!

685
00:32:49,903 --> 00:32:51,672
Oh, shit. What did you do?

686
00:32:51,808 --> 00:32:53,938
- Look, man, I'm sorry.
- No. Hey, hey. Uh-uh. Hey! Okay.

687
00:32:54,074 --> 00:32:55,342
No, no, you're good, you're
good, you're good, you're good.

688
00:32:55,477 --> 00:32:56,772
We got to go. No, we got to go.

689
00:32:56,907 --> 00:32:58,446
No, we got to fucking...
got to go!

690
00:32:58,581 --> 00:33:00,818
- We can't leave him.
- What are you doing?

691
00:33:00,954 --> 00:33:02,617
Just hold your hand like this.

692
00:33:02,753 --> 00:33:04,614
- Will. Hey, Will, come on.
- Give me your hand. Give me...

693
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:07,622
- Let go. You hear me? We have to go.
- No.

694
00:33:07,757 --> 00:33:09,995
- Listen to me. Leave him. Let's go!
- Hey, hey, hey.

695
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,625
- Let's go!
- Hey, put your hand here.

696
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,331
- Yo, you want to stay here?
- This is gonna help.

697
00:33:13,466 --> 00:33:15,024
- Somebody's gonna come, okay?
- Look how this looks.

698
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,296
- Somebody's on the way.
- Look how this looks, Will.

699
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:18,028
- Okay!
- Look how this looks!

700
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:19,496
Just take one second in your
mind and see how this looks.

701
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:21,364
We got to go. We have to go.

702
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,002
Let's go right now.

703

Move. Move.

704
00:33:25,102 --> 00:33:27,471
You fucking punch me,
and that's what happens.

705
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:29,004
He's a fucking Marine, man.

706
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,610
- Hey, let's fucking go!
- What were you thinking?

707
00:33:38,615 --> 00:33:40,620
Drop it! Drop it!

708

Man, they're everywhere.

Go, go! Back, back, back! Go!

Shit. I didn't mean to shoot.
I didn't mean to shoot him.

727
00:34:40,517 --> 00:34:42,517

Shit.

729

00:34:58,201 --> 00:34:59,600
What are you doing?

731
00:35:01,373 --> 00:35:02,907
What are you doing?

732
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:04,234
We gonna shoot our way out?

733
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:05,738
What?

734
00:35:05,873 --> 00:35:07,938
- Fucking had to shoot a cop, huh?
- Oh, no.

735
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:09,947
- Not this, not this.
- This is how we roll.

736
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:11,908
Tell me this is not the plan.

737
00:35:12,044 --> 00:35:14,117

You're okay. Stay with me.

758
00:36:20,944 --> 00:36:22,320
Yeah, I've got you. You hear me?

759
00:36:22,455 --> 00:36:23,813
- Huh? Hey. Hey, hey.
- They're running away.

760
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:26,022
How's the prom queen, bud? Huh?

761
00:36:26,157 --> 00:36:27,526
You gonna ask her out?

762
00:36:27,661 --> 00:36:29,320
Zach!

763
00:36:31,294 --> 00:36:33,298
Hey, get over here!

764
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:35,826
They're coming. Hey.

765

Look at me. Look at me.

00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:38,167
You're okay.

767
00:36:38,302 --> 00:36:39,832
You got to go on that date.

768
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:42,165
You hear me, Zach? Zach!

769
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,475
Go! There's two suspects...
one Black, one white. Go!

770
00:37:04,221 --> 00:37:05,354
Go. Squeeze through.
Squeeze through.

771
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,057
Just go.

Shit.

Shit. Oh, shit!

774
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,704
They're locking this place down.

775
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,783
I don't know, man!
Just, come on!

776
00:37:24,918 --> 00:37:26,084
Come on, let's go!

777
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:27,381
- Hurry!
- Where did he get shot?

778
00:37:27,517 --> 00:37:29,217
- In the leg.
- Oh, shit.

779
00:37:29,352 --> 00:37:30,385
Any other gun wounds?

780
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,090
- I-I don't know.
- Are you sure?

781
00:37:32,225 --> 00:37:34,722
- I don't know.
- Okay. Move.

782
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,223
No exit.
Probably got the femur.

783
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:39,558
Okay.

784
00:37:39,694 --> 00:37:41,128
Shed me light, shed me light.

785
00:37:41,263 --> 00:37:42,594
Over here.

786
00:37:42,729 --> 00:37:44,125
- What's his name?
- Zach.

787
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:45,903
Okay. Give me this.
Give me this.

788
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:47,805
Zach. Zach, buddy.

789
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,566
Come to me.

790
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,403
Zach. Hey, buddy.

791
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:54,379
Come to me. Come to me.

792
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,278
There he is. There he is.

793
00:37:58,414 --> 00:37:59,478
Let's carry him up.

794
00:37:59,614 --> 00:38:01,612
Help us. One, two, three.

795
00:38:01,748 --> 00:38:04,084
Go!

796
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:05,589
Clear.

797
00:38:05,724 --> 00:38:07,487
- Hey, hey. You're okay now.
- Come on, go, go.

798
00:38:07,622 --> 00:38:09,486
I had him go in for a girl.

799
00:38:09,622 --> 00:38:11,088
It's my fault.

800
00:38:11,223 --> 00:38:12,925
- I had him go in for a girl.
- Mark, save it.

801
00:38:22,936 --> 00:38:24,438
Call Memorial.
Tell them we have

802
00:38:24,574 --> 00:38:26,004
an ETA of seven minutes, okay?

803
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:28,813
'Cause you're driving
like a goddamned granny.

804
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:32,278
Zach, I'm gonna be
helping you, okay?

805
00:38:38,258 --> 00:38:39,449
God, he's losing so much blood.

806
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:40,683
Scott?

807
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,457
Shit. Call trauma.

808
00:38:42,592 --> 00:38:43,788
Tell them to activate the team.

809
00:38:43,923 --> 00:38:45,328
We're gonna need lots of blood.

810
00:38:45,463 --> 00:38:46,988
He's hypotensive
and tachycardic.

811
00:38:47,123 --> 00:38:48,858
We need to move fast, okay?

812
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,163
Where is this blood coming from?

813
00:38:50,298 --> 00:38:52,096
Whew.

814
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,875
Stop! Get out.

815
00:38:59,307 --> 00:39:00,511
Get out.

816
00:39:02,014 --> 00:39:03,646
Cam. Cam!

817
00:39:03,782 --> 00:39:05,207
- Get out now.
- Cam, there's a guy with a big

818
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:06,478
fucking gun pointed
at me right now.

819
00:39:06,614 --> 00:39:07,513
That wasn't a question.

820
00:39:07,649 --> 00:39:09,384
- Get out now.
- What?

821
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,481
- I mean, we...
- Now.

822
00:39:14,122 --> 00:39:15,689
Will, get the paramedic's
jacket. You drive.

823
00:39:15,824 --> 00:39:17,693
We don't have a choice.
Let's go.

824
00:39:18,966 --> 00:39:20,162
Step back up.

825
00:39:20,297 --> 00:39:21,560
What do you want?

826
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:22,824
Just gonna borrow it.

827
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,991
All right? Come on.

828
00:39:24,127 --> 00:39:25,530
Did you shoot him already?

829
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:26,730
No, I did not shoot him.

830
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:28,033
Will, bring the bags here.

831
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,511
All right. Let's go.

832
00:39:35,477 --> 00:39:37,246
You got point?

833
00:39:37,382 --> 00:39:39,017
I got point! I got point!

834
00:39:39,152 --> 00:39:40,716
- Overlap!
- Go!

835
00:39:42,014 --> 00:39:44,251
Move. Move. Go.

836
00:39:47,325 --> 00:39:49,059
Whew.

837
00:39:49,194 --> 00:39:50,692
A lot of running.

838
00:39:50,828 --> 00:39:53,356
Just like any other day
for you, Camille,

839
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:55,395
except the life you save today
might be your own.

840
00:39:55,531 --> 00:39:56,893
Do your job, all right?

841
00:39:57,029 --> 00:39:59,570
It's-it's Cam. My name is Cam.

842
00:40:00,701 --> 00:40:02,033
Oh, no way.

843
00:40:02,169 --> 00:40:04,540
My name's Daniel,
but I prefer Danny.

844
00:40:04,675 --> 00:40:06,570
I don't give a fuck.

845
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:08,403
Cam, okay?

846
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,542
We got cops ahead.

847
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:13,713
Okay.

848
00:40:13,848 --> 00:40:15,051
Cops, cops, cops.

849
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:19,887
All right, look, Cam,
we can shoot our way

850
00:40:20,022 --> 00:40:21,616
out of this,
or you can help us, all right?

851
00:40:21,751 --> 00:40:23,858
I'm gonna need you to help us.
Why don't you help us?

852
00:40:25,193 --> 00:40:26,563
- Officer down!
- Nod if you understand.

853
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:29,056
- Get out the way!
- Do you understand, Cam?

854
00:40:29,192 --> 00:40:30,232
What's your hospital, Cam?

855
00:40:30,368 --> 00:40:31,901
It's-it's L.A. Memorial.

856
00:40:32,037 --> 00:40:33,736
- Will, you got it?
- I got it, I got it, I got it.

857
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:37,232
Oh, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.

858
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:38,906
Who let you in here?
Who let you in?

859
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:40,401
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I got an officer down!

860
00:40:40,537 --> 00:40:41,943
- Check the back.
- I've got an officer down.

861
00:40:42,078 --> 00:40:43,575
- We're going to Memorial.
- Let me see your hands.

862
00:40:43,711 --> 00:40:44,741
Wade, check inside.

863
00:40:44,877 --> 00:40:46,243
Who let you in here?

864
00:40:47,253 --> 00:40:48,151
Let me see your hands.

865
00:40:48,287 --> 00:40:50,088
Keep 'em up. Don't move.

866
00:40:50,223 --> 00:40:51,621
Chris, Chris, hold it.

867
00:40:51,757 --> 00:40:53,784
Hey, I'm just a...
I'm just a driver.

868
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,256
I've got an officer down.

869
00:40:55,391 --> 00:40:57,458
Ready? Go.

870
00:40:57,593 --> 00:40:59,659
Who is it? Who is it?

871
00:40:59,794 --> 00:41:01,424
I got a...

872
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,467
I got a cop shot.
We got to go. Move your cars.

873
00:41:03,603 --> 00:41:05,100
We got to get him
to the hospital.

874
00:41:05,235 --> 00:41:06,571
Move!

875
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:10,431
It's a cop!

876
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:12,342
Let me do my job!
What are you doing?

877
00:41:12,478 --> 00:41:13,775
- Go!
- All right. Fine.

878
00:41:13,911 --> 00:41:15,338
He's a cop.
Let's get him out of here.

879
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,108
All right, let's go.
Get him out of here.

880
00:41:17,244 --> 00:41:18,612
- Go! Go, go, go!
- All right, let's go!

881
00:41:18,747 --> 00:41:20,616
Let's go! Let's go, people!

882
00:41:20,751 --> 00:41:22,785
Make a hole. Get 'em out.

883
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,285
All right, move!
Get out of the way!

884
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,352
Out of the way!

885
00:41:25,487 --> 00:41:26,981
There we go.

886
00:41:31,496 --> 00:41:33,598
See? That wasn't so hard.

887
00:41:38,265 --> 00:41:40,004
Give me your phone.
G-Give me your phone.

888
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:41,366
Yeah, yeah.

889
00:41:42,805 --> 00:41:44,035
Lights. I need lights. Lights.

890
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:45,809
Center console. The red button.

891
00:41:45,944 --> 00:41:47,011
- Which one? Which one?
- The red button. Right there.

892
00:41:50,617 --> 00:41:52,980
Hey, Will. We got through it.

893
00:41:53,116 --> 00:41:55,653
Not as tight as I wanted,
but we got through it.

894
00:42:00,822 --> 00:42:03,819
$16 million. $16 million.

895
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:07,825
Say, Cam, how does
your company track this thing?

896
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,667
Satellite.

897
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,205
Found it.

898
00:42:17,674 --> 00:42:20,508
I'm gonna work on him now.

899
00:42:20,643 --> 00:42:22,339
Is that okay with you?

900
00:42:22,475 --> 00:42:24,845
Yeah, yeah.
Work on saving the rookie.

901
00:42:24,981 --> 00:42:26,677
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, buddy!

902
00:42:26,813 --> 00:42:27,844
What happened?

903
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,213
Hey, what happened?

904
00:42:29,348 --> 00:42:30,752
Where's the ambulance?
What happened?

905
00:42:30,888 --> 00:42:32,181
- Huh?
- They took the ambulance.

906
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:34,153
- Say "they"?
- They took...

907
00:42:35,823 --> 00:42:37,355
1-Adam-25 to Control.

908
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:39,924
Suspects have hijacked
a red and white ambulance.

909
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,759
The ambulance got my partner.

910
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:43,833
They got my partner.

911
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:49,767
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

912
00:42:49,902 --> 00:42:51,533
Hey, listen. Hey.

913
00:42:51,668 --> 00:42:55,174
You tell me exactly
what they look like.

914
00:42:56,243 --> 00:42:57,744
Backup car's on Flower, Will.

915
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,546
Just at the end of the street.

916
00:42:59,681 --> 00:43:00,880
- Got it?
- Yeah.

917
00:43:01,016 --> 00:43:02,584
- Hey, give me your radio.
- What?

918
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,380
Give me your radio.

919
00:43:04,516 --> 00:43:06,049
What are you gonna do
with those?

920
00:43:06,185 --> 00:43:07,592
Don't worry about that.

921
00:43:07,728 --> 00:43:09,726
You're not gonna put those
on me, are you?

922
00:43:09,862 --> 00:43:11,256
When we're clear,
I'm gonna call 911.

923
00:43:11,391 --> 00:43:12,954
I'm gonna tell them
where you are. Okay?

924
00:43:13,089 --> 00:43:14,725
All right?

925
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,460
Yeah. Hey.

926
00:43:16,596 --> 00:43:18,299
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to point the gun at you.

927
00:43:18,434 --> 00:43:19,902
I don't really
like pointing guns at anybody.

928
00:43:20,038 --> 00:43:21,970
It's not really my thing,
but, like, when you...

929
00:43:22,106 --> 00:43:23,632
I mean, what was I
supposed to do, you know?

930
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:25,776
I know it's funny, but it's...
I'm sort of more of

931
00:43:25,912 --> 00:43:27,606
the sensitive one
of the two of us. It's...

932
00:43:35,078 --> 00:43:36,317
Hey, boss.

933
00:43:36,452 --> 00:43:38,089
Jesus.

934
00:43:38,224 --> 00:43:39,315
Talk to me.

935
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:40,756
How does something
like this go down

936
00:43:40,892 --> 00:43:42,586
right in front
of LAPD headquarters?

937
00:43:42,722 --> 00:43:44,324
So the Brooklyn crew we've been
following, they're all dead.

938
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,923
Yeah, we think it's an L.A.
crew inside the ambulance.

939
00:43:46,058 --> 00:43:47,291
Oh, we got a new crew?

940
00:43:47,426 --> 00:43:49,466
We don't know.
It's looking that way.

941
00:43:49,601 --> 00:43:50,930
Talk to me about that ambulance.

942
00:43:51,065 --> 00:43:52,669
- Who fucked that up?
- We did.

943
00:43:52,805 --> 00:43:54,438
- It was a clusterfuck.
- You think?

944
00:43:54,573 --> 00:43:55,971
But the rookie screwed us up

945
00:43:56,107 --> 00:43:57,333
trying to get his future
ex-wife's phone number.

946
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:58,775
What's that? What'd you say?

947
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,507
You're the one
that caused this mess.

948
00:44:02,077 --> 00:44:03,440
- Huh? What'd you say?
- Hey!

949
00:44:03,576 --> 00:44:04,647
- What'd you say? Huh?
- All right, all right!

950
00:44:04,783 --> 00:44:05,946
- Say it again!
- Hey!

951
00:44:06,081 --> 00:44:07,111
Calm down
before I smash your ass

952
00:44:07,246 --> 00:44:08,610
- back to the academy.
- Stop.

953
00:44:08,745 --> 00:44:09,851
- You're the reason we're in this.
- Stop!

954
00:44:09,987 --> 00:44:11,280
Mark, right?
Can I call you Mark?

955
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:12,790
- Yeah.
- That was my call, Mark.

956
00:44:12,925 --> 00:44:14,825
You want to blame somebody,
you blame me.

957
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,957
Now it's my job to get
your partner back, okay?

958
00:44:17,092 --> 00:44:19,191
- His name's Zach.
- All right.

959
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,459
Three months out of the academy.
Good kid.

960
00:44:21,595 --> 00:44:23,793
- He's gonna be all right.
- You know that for sure?

961
00:44:23,928 --> 00:44:26,936
No, but I know I got the best
possible people on it, okay?

962
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:31,802
<i>Air 11 over City Hall,
southbound 900.</i>

963
00:44:31,937 --> 00:44:33,539
<i>Be advised, suspect
fled from a parking garage.</i>

964
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:35,945
<i>Ambulance marked "Unit 3."
Injured officer inside.</i>

965
00:44:44,347 --> 00:44:46,648
Whoa! What's going on?

966
00:44:46,783 --> 00:44:48,390
What the hell?

967
00:44:48,526 --> 00:44:49,990
We're screwed.

968
00:44:50,126 --> 00:44:52,291
- We got an airship.
- What?

969
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,495
Airship.

970
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,164
Where?

971
00:44:57,299 --> 00:44:58,667
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

972
00:44:58,802 --> 00:45:00,201
You sure they see us or not?

973
00:45:00,336 --> 00:45:02,006
- Yeah, no, no. Shit. Look.
- I'm not sure.

974
00:45:02,142 --> 00:45:03,340
They just flew right
over us. They didn't see us.

975
00:45:05,143 --> 00:45:06,877
Really, really wasn't expecting
helicopters today.

976
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:10,407
- You think we should bounce on foot?
- No, no.

977
00:45:10,543 --> 00:45:12,408
The stash car's too far.
We won't make it.

978
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:14,682
- Shit.
- Just drive.

979
00:45:14,817 --> 00:45:16,011
Drive, Will. Come on.

980
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:18,020
Will, drive.

981
00:45:18,155 --> 00:45:19,682
We're a sitting duck, Will.
We got to move.

982
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:20,920
We're not gonna do anything.
We're just sitting here.

983
00:45:21,055 --> 00:45:22,253
I got to get back to my wife

984
00:45:22,388 --> 00:45:23,518
and my son, Danny,
no matter what.

985
00:45:23,653 --> 00:45:24,862
You're going to.
You drove generals

986
00:45:24,997 --> 00:45:26,557
and politicians in Kabul.
You can do this.

987
00:45:26,692 --> 00:45:28,358
- This ain't Kabul, man.
- I know. It's L. fucking A.

988
00:45:28,494 --> 00:45:29,698
Nobody knows this city
better than you.

989
00:45:29,834 --> 00:45:31,165
Nobody drives better than you.

990
00:45:32,999 --> 00:45:35,235
Will, come on.

991
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:37,035
I'm gonna get you back home,
little brother.

992
00:45:37,171 --> 00:45:39,035
I'm gonna get everybody home.

993
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,042
Come on, little brother.
Come on.

994
00:45:48,177 --> 00:45:49,543
Will.

995
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:51,288
All right. Yeah?

996
00:45:56,593 --> 00:45:58,225
Let's go.

997
00:46:14,443 --> 00:46:16,439
Hey, what is it?
What's going on back there?

998
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,410
It's good.
I'm just helping him.

999
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:24,079
- Hey, hey! What?
- Hey, what the...

1000
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:25,619
What? What?

1001
00:46:30,728 --> 00:46:33,790
Hey! Don't you move!

1002
00:46:33,926 --> 00:46:35,394
Stop it!

1003
00:46:37,229 --> 00:46:38,769
Come back here now.

1004
00:46:38,905 --> 00:46:41,264
Turn around and go.

1005
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,333
Come on! We do not have time.

1006
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:45,474
Come on, Cam.

1007
00:46:46,646 --> 00:46:47,978
Oh, shit.

1008
00:46:49,311 --> 00:46:51,440
Hey, wake up. Wake up.
Hey, hey. Shit!

1009
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:52,817
Hey, help!

1010
00:46:52,952 --> 00:46:55,443
The heart machine is buzzing!
Help!

1011
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,453
Come on, Cam. Let's go.

1012
00:46:59,491 --> 00:47:01,290
Fuck you.

1013
00:47:01,425 --> 00:47:03,460
I don't know what happened.
It just started beeping.

1014
00:47:03,595 --> 00:47:05,196
Shit. He's V-fib.

1015
00:47:05,331 --> 00:47:06,792
Fuck.

1016
00:47:06,928 --> 00:47:08,427
Come on, Zach.

1017
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,627
Oh, God. Come on.
One, two, three, four, five.

1018
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:14,137
I don't know what happened.

1019
00:47:14,273 --> 00:47:15,306
- It just started beeping.
- He's about to die.

1020
00:47:15,442 --> 00:47:16,867
It's cashmere!

1021
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:18,833
Drive.

1022
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,146
Save that cop's life!

1023
00:47:24,282 --> 00:47:25,882
<i>Okay, we got to stay
in the alleys.</i>

1024
00:47:26,018 --> 00:47:27,345
What? No.
Just-just take Spring.

1025
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,513
You want to drive,
or can I drive?

1026
00:47:29,953 --> 00:47:32,852
Just drive fast.

1027
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:38,323
- We're doing hostages now?
- What?

1028
00:47:38,459 --> 00:47:40,526
- Hostages.
- The ones in the back?

1029
00:47:40,661 --> 00:47:43,297
Yes, we are, Will.
Is there a problem with that?

1030
00:47:50,476 --> 00:47:53,211
<i>L.A. Sheriff's 172,

<i>Uh, coming up to Scientology.

1033
00:47:59,141 --> 00:48:01,176
Hey, Cap. Air support
just spotted the ambulance

1034
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:02,547
six blocks east.

1035
00:48:02,682 --> 00:48:04,349
Lock everything down.
Nothing gets out.

1036
00:48:04,485 --> 00:48:06,354
I want mobile command
moving in five.

1037
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:08,383
- Let's go, boys.
- Hey, Cap. What about your dog?

1038
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:09,717
Yeah, you take Nitro home.

1039
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:10,925
Treat him like
he's your own, okay?

1040
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,190
- Yes, sir.
- Good boy.

1041
00:48:12,325 --> 00:48:14,196
Oh, Cap, what's that smell?

1042
00:48:14,331 --> 00:48:16,097
Oh, we had Mongolian barbecue
last night.

1043
00:48:16,233 --> 00:48:18,898
Good boy. Good boy. All right.

1044
00:48:19,034 --> 00:48:20,829
I'll treat you good.

1045
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,911
Okay, keep pushing,
keep pushing, keep pushing.

1046
00:48:29,046 --> 00:48:30,707
Oh, God.

1047
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:34,513
Two...

1048
00:48:38,022 --> 00:48:40,116
It's clear I'm not a priority.

1049
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:42,783
That's not true.

1050
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:44,058
I mean, it would be great

1051
00:48:44,194 --> 00:48:45,391
if we could talk
about something

1052
00:48:45,526 --> 00:48:47,623
- other than bad guys...
- Mmm.

1053
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:52,133
...and bank robbers
and murderers.

1054
00:48:52,269 --> 00:48:53,762
I'm not quite sure what else

1055
00:48:53,898 --> 00:48:55,730
I'm supposed to talk about
when I get home.

1056
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:58,101
Something other
than bad people, maybe.

1057
00:48:58,236 --> 00:48:59,909
Maybe me.

1058
00:49:00,044 --> 00:49:02,747
You could ask me how I'm doing.

1059
00:49:02,882 --> 00:49:04,747
He got a promotion. Yeah, yeah.

1060
00:49:04,883 --> 00:49:07,282
He's a big FBI agent now.

1061
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:09,751
Finally, I have a chance
to run my own unit.

1062
00:49:09,886 --> 00:49:11,285
What kind of unit?

1063
00:49:11,421 --> 00:49:13,717
Special agent in charge
of L.A. Bank Division.

1064
00:49:15,893 --> 00:49:17,754
People still rob banks?

1065
00:49:19,132 --> 00:49:20,821
Kyle, do we have to pay
for the dumb questions,

1066
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:22,257
or-or are these ones
free of charge?

1067
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:23,930
You're so rude.

1068
00:49:27,238 --> 00:49:28,897
Can you put that away, please?

1069
00:49:29,807 --> 00:49:31,405
I got to go, boo.

1070
00:49:34,637 --> 00:49:36,113
Hey, boss.

1071
00:49:36,248 --> 00:49:38,782
Chief Moore just gave us
full tactical control.

1072
00:49:38,918 --> 00:49:40,181
Of course he did.

1073
00:49:40,316 --> 00:49:41,950
No one else wants
this shit show.

1074
00:49:42,085 --> 00:49:43,283
Hey, the mobile CP just arrived.

1075
00:49:43,419 --> 00:49:45,782
I got to go.
My ride's finally here.

1076
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:50,319
Mobile MCU on site.

1077
00:49:50,455 --> 00:49:51,693
Damn, you're young.

1078
00:49:51,828 --> 00:49:53,157
You're old.

1079
00:49:53,293 --> 00:49:54,862
Let's hope you keep up.

1080
00:49:54,998 --> 00:49:56,458
I like her. Talk to me.

1081
00:49:56,594 --> 00:49:57,958
You better know the city.

1082
00:49:58,094 --> 00:49:59,663
- Like the back of my hand.
- Tell me, then.

1083
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:02,139
We have mutual aid
with Sheriff's, the CHP.

1087
00:50:07,675 --> 00:50:08,977
It looks brand-new,
and the guy driving

1088
00:50:09,112 --> 00:50:10,510
is possibly Lewis Hamilton.

1089
00:50:10,645 --> 00:50:12,010
Who's that?
Basketball player or something?

1090
00:50:12,146 --> 00:50:13,975
Best F1 racer.

1091
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:16,344
F1... that's for fancy people.
I'm a dog guy.

1092

Oh, that's nice.

1093
00:50:17,815 --> 00:50:19,520
Dhazghig.
It's pronounced "Zaga."

1094
00:50:19,656 --> 00:50:21,491
And, due respect, sir,
we don't have time to flirt.

1095
00:50:21,627 --> 00:50:24,022
Rush hour's in 45 minutes, and
Dad's making gomgush tonight.

1096
00:50:24,157 --> 00:50:26,159
Okay. Dhazghig.

1097
00:50:26,294 --> 00:50:27,488
Don't let 'em out of your sight.

they have on board.

1105
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:44,874
Get 'em fast. Over.

1106
00:50:46,713 --> 00:50:48,209

than most,

1110
00:51:02,496 --> 00:51:03,524
and you're gonna
help me execute.

1111
00:51:03,659 --> 00:51:05,027
S.I.S. deals with

1112
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:06,866
the smartest and
the most dangerous criminals.

1113
00:51:07,001 --> 00:51:09,503
I need to know who I'm dealing
with, everything about them.

1114
00:51:13,412 --> 00:51:15,370
<i>I'm requesting units
to set up a perimeter.</i>

1115
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:17,205
Strategy.

1116
00:51:17,341 --> 00:51:19,374
Kind of like a mix between
a chess match and a cage fight.

1117
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,043
Great analogy.

1118
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:22,780
Put a little
pressure on, then I pull back.

1119
00:51:22,915 --> 00:51:25,783
Then I push harder,
get 'em off balance.

1120
00:51:25,918 --> 00:51:27,891
In two hours, they're
either dead or in cuffs.

1121
00:51:28,026 --> 00:51:29,724
Uh, not the fluffy ones, though.

1122
00:51:29,859 --> 00:51:31,956
The real hard metal. You know,
the cold metal on the skin.

1123
00:51:32,091 --> 00:51:34,022
All right. We're on the clock, Dhazghig.

1124
00:51:41,868 --> 00:51:43,898
Okay, this is Captain Monroe.
Listen up.

1125
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:46,066
We're not throwing down
spike strips.

1126
00:51:46,202 --> 00:51:47,735
We're not crashing
into this ambulance.

1127
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:49,774
We got a brother cop on board.

1128
00:51:53,451 --> 00:51:54,576
Cam, we're almost
out of your hair.

1129
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:56,087
You just keep pumping.

1130
00:51:56,222 --> 00:51:57,918
<i>But I'm gonna call 911
for you, okay?</i>

1131
00:51:58,053 --> 00:51:59,421
- <i>And sorry about that gun thing, really.</i>
- <i>Yeah, all good.</i>

1132
00:51:59,556 --> 00:52:00,923
Just call 911.
You're rich now, boys.

1133
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:07,792
No. No, no, no, no, no. No.

1134
00:52:07,928 --> 00:52:10,095
- Shit.
- No. Shit. Where did they come from?

1135
00:52:23,241 --> 00:52:24,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1136
00:52:24,576 --> 00:52:25,909
Quiet. I need it quiet.

1137
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:42,332
<i>Crossed traffic,
due head-on. He's head-on.</i>

1138
00:52:44,668 --> 00:52:46,831
- Whoa. Easy, easy.
- Come on, come on, come on.

1139
00:52:46,966 --> 00:52:48,932
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Two cars! Two cars!

1140
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,167
<i>There are two cars!
They're right...</i>

1141
00:53:05,789 --> 00:53:07,314
- We got to ditch this.
- I'm on it, I'm on it.

1142
00:53:07,449 --> 00:53:08,352
- We got to ditch this ambulance now.
- I'm on it.

1143
00:53:08,488 --> 00:53:09,817
Find me a street, Danny.

1144
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:11,494
- What?
- Just find me a street.

1145
00:53:11,629 --> 00:53:12,856
<i>Air 11,
suspects are now southbound.</i>

1146
00:53:12,991 --> 00:53:14,694
<i>He's coming right at you.</i>

1147
00:53:19,871 --> 00:53:21,371
Shit. Shit.

1148
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:23,833
I can't do this alone.

1149
00:53:23,969 --> 00:53:25,835
I need more hands than this.
Danny!

1150
00:53:25,971 --> 00:53:27,344
Get your ass back here.
He's dying.

1151
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,570
- I need your help. I need more hands.
- What?

1152
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,072
You need to help me.

1153
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,340
Go help her.
Help the cop. Help the cop!

1154
00:53:32,476 --> 00:53:34,209
You're gonna have a cop dead
any minute now, and you're

1155
00:53:34,345 --> 00:53:36,012
going to prison for the rest
of your fucking life.

1156
00:53:38,358 --> 00:53:39,856
- What's going on?
- I'm about to lose him.

1157
00:53:39,992 --> 00:53:41,358
Get the defib pads.

1158
00:53:41,493 --> 00:53:42,685
- The what?
- The defibs on the right pocket.

1159
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,119
Grab them quick. Move, move.

1160
00:53:45,523 --> 00:53:48,223
<i>Turning into the bus
yard underneath the 10 freeway.</i>

1161
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:50,025
<i>We're gonna lose sight.</i>

1162
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,365
<i>Grab them quick. Move, move!</i>

1163
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,031
<i>Help me with his neck, please.</i>

1164
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:54,536
- <i>His neck keeps...</i>
- <i>Just let it go.</i>

1165
00:53:54,672 --> 00:53:55,931
I need the pads urgently,
or he's gonna die.

1166
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:58,032
- Do I look like an EMT?
- Jesus! Daniel!

1167
00:53:58,168 --> 00:53:59,541
<i>Your yelling doesn't help.</i>

1168
00:53:59,676 --> 00:54:00,701
<i>Goddamn it,
I'm not used to being</i>

1169
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:02,369
in a police chase, okay?

1170
00:54:02,504 --> 00:54:03,908
- Open them.
- All right, all right. Just give me a...

1171
00:54:04,043 --> 00:54:05,415
One, two, three.
I need the pads urgently,

1172
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:07,044
- or he's gonna die.
- I got it. Hold tight.

1173
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:08,583
<i>Black pocket,
next to the monitor.</i>

1174
00:54:08,718 --> 00:54:10,884
- Right and left ribs.
- One has a little heart.

1175
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:13,254
- It has a picture.
- And then one has a one on the pad.

1176
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:14,386
So, the right chest, left rib.

1177
00:54:14,521 --> 00:54:15,882
Right there and there.

1178
00:54:16,018 --> 00:54:18,061
M-My right or your right?

1179
00:54:18,197 --> 00:54:19,597
His right, you fucking moron.

1180
00:54:20,366 --> 00:54:22,457
Hang tight. Shit.

1181
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,892
Jesus!

1182
00:54:33,407 --> 00:54:34,442
Charge it to 300.

1183
00:54:36,779 --> 00:54:38,748
Yellow button. Yellow button.
"Alarms."

1184
00:54:38,883 --> 00:54:40,407
- It says "charge," and then it says...
- Yeah, that button.

1185
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:41,746
- The yellow one.
- Then there's, like, a squiggly...

1186
00:54:41,882 --> 00:54:43,410
Yeah, I know. I just-just...

1187
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:45,249
Danny, the only fucking button
that says "charge"!

1188
00:54:45,384 --> 00:54:47,821
It looks like a fucking Atari
game! I don't fucking know!

1189
00:54:47,957 --> 00:54:49,790
- Just... Charge? Charge? What?
- Clear. Stay clear.

1190
00:54:49,925 --> 00:54:51,762
- Move, move, move!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

1191
00:54:51,897 --> 00:54:53,160
Go. Clear.

1192
00:54:53,295 --> 00:54:55,091
Whoa! Shit. Whoa.

1193
00:54:55,226 --> 00:54:56,994
We need to take him
to the hospital now!

1194
00:54:57,129 --> 00:54:58,964
Yeah, well,
I wish I didn't have herpes,

1195
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,768
but, you know, we all
got to go with what we got.

1196
00:55:19,092 --> 00:55:21,017
Oh, man.

1197
00:55:21,152 --> 00:55:22,690
You are lucky
you just get to drive.

1198
00:55:22,825 --> 00:55:24,989
We just zapped him.
We did that shock shit.

1199
00:55:27,095 --> 00:55:29,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Dead end. Dead end.

1200
00:55:32,999 --> 00:55:34,632
Can you get
just a little closer?

1201
00:55:34,768 --> 00:55:36,203
'Cause I can't read the sign.

1202
00:55:36,339 --> 00:55:38,298
My bad, my bad, my bad.

1203
00:55:38,434 --> 00:55:39,506
You're not listening
to my directions.

1204
00:55:39,641 --> 00:55:40,971
<i>Units responding,</i>

1205
00:55:41,107 --> 00:55:41,940
<i>it's a dead-end street.
Slow down.</i>

1206
00:55:53,118 --> 00:55:54,825
Yep, that's on me.
I fucked that up.

1207
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,954
Yeah, yeah.

1208
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,729
Beast.

1209
00:56:01,864 --> 00:56:04,161
He's knocking my cars around
like tenpins.

1210
00:56:04,296 --> 00:56:06,800
Yeah, it's a very expensive
car chase right now.

1211
00:56:31,022 --> 00:56:32,861
That cop helo's got us.

1212
00:56:32,997 --> 00:56:35,189
We should've parked the stash
car under the bridge, man.

1213
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:36,592
Well, sorry I didn't
think of that.

1214
00:56:36,728 --> 00:56:38,259
We need cover.

1215
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:40,497
Enough time to ditch and run.
Shit.

1216
00:56:41,567 --> 00:56:44,207
In Afghanistan, we'd have Preds
track terrorists under bridges

1217
00:56:44,343 --> 00:56:45,441
and they'd Texas-switch on us.

1218
00:56:45,577 --> 00:56:47,036
Texas switch is like
when a terrorist

1219
00:56:47,172 --> 00:56:48,578
drives under a bridge
with one car

1220
00:56:48,713 --> 00:56:50,380
and they pop out
with five identical cars.

1221
00:56:50,515 --> 00:56:52,340
I mean, it's crazy,
but it worked.

1222
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,281
Whoa, it's only six blocks away.

1223
00:56:57,417 --> 00:56:58,885
Cam.

1224
00:56:59,021 --> 00:57:00,587
In the ambulance yard,
do they keep the keys

1225
00:57:00,722 --> 00:57:03,124
in the gas cap or in the visor?

1226
00:57:03,259 --> 00:57:06,090
In the cap. Why?

1227
00:57:19,274 --> 00:57:20,601
Papi.

1228
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:22,103
Roberto.

1229
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:24,548
- Danny Sharp.
- Thank you, son.

1230
00:57:25,712 --> 00:57:27,918
Burner? <i>Qué drama.</i>

1231
00:57:28,053 --> 00:57:29,609
Danny boy.

1232
00:57:29,745 --> 00:57:32,652
You're interrupting
a very exciting police chase.

1233
00:57:32,787 --> 00:57:34,256
They're chasing some ambulance.

1234
00:57:34,392 --> 00:57:36,593
Yeah, I am the ambulance.

1235
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:39,122
Wow.

1236
00:57:39,258 --> 00:57:40,822
It's a bit tense
in here right now.

1237
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,596
Jesus, <i>vato.</i>

1238
00:57:43,732 --> 00:57:45,596
Never a dull moment with you.

1239
00:57:45,732 --> 00:57:47,999
Why are you calling me?

1240
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:49,604
Look, I need help.
I need a diversion.

1241
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:50,936
I'm kind of in
a dealmaking mood.

1242
00:57:51,071 --> 00:57:53,636
<i>All right. Start boxing them in</i>

1243
00:57:59,113 --> 00:58:00,644
You should've thought of that
before, Danny.

1244
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,113
You're on your own now.

1245
00:58:02,248 --> 00:58:03,785
Look, I got 16 million
in here right now.

1246
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,622
You throw me a lifeline,
I'll give you half.

1247
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,493
<i>Come on, Papi.</i>

1248
00:58:09,628 --> 00:58:11,459
<i>Do it for my dad.
You're family.</i>

1249
00:58:11,595 --> 00:58:12,826
I know about the Zetas, Papi.

1250
00:58:12,961 --> 00:58:14,290
I know about the money
you owe them.

1251
00:58:14,425 --> 00:58:15,623
You save my ass,
you can buy 'em out tonight.

1252
00:58:19,434 --> 00:58:20,697
What's the plan?

1253
00:58:20,832 --> 00:58:22,366
Look, it's simple.

1254
00:58:22,502 --> 00:58:23,798
I just need your guys to
pick up some trucks Downtown.

1255
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:25,509
We got a deal?

1256
00:58:25,645 --> 00:58:27,535
We just steal them
from the yard, yeah?

1257
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,642
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man,
we'll pick 'em up. Don't worry.

1258
00:58:29,777 --> 00:58:31,639
I'll get Roberto right now.

1259
00:58:31,775 --> 00:58:32,979
Goddamn.

1260
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,154
Saddle up. We're on the move.

1261
00:58:37,289 --> 00:58:38,378
What's up?

1262
00:58:38,514 --> 00:58:40,718
It's insane,
and it's our ticket.

1263
00:58:40,854 --> 00:58:42,689
Make your moves.

1264
00:58:45,293 --> 00:58:47,528
All you got to do is go that way.

1265
00:58:47,663 --> 00:58:49,324
Pass it, though. Oh, my God.

1266
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:52,501
G-Go!
That's what they pay you for.

1267
00:58:52,636 --> 00:58:54,167
- Hello?
- Hey, Castro.

1268
00:58:54,303 --> 00:58:55,669
Boss man, what's up, man?
Your flamingos just got here.

1269
00:58:55,804 --> 00:58:57,063
What you want me
to do with them?

1270
00:58:57,199 --> 00:58:59,008
They came to the office?

1271
00:58:59,144 --> 00:59:00,539
No, they're supposed to be at
the Turks and Caicos property.

1272
00:59:00,675 --> 00:59:01,874
She turns six tomorrow.

1273
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:03,671
I'm gonna get
in so much trouble, man.

1274
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:06,175
<i>We have the elephants.
We have the bouncy castle.</i>

1275
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:07,517
Tommy the Clown
is already there.

1276
00:59:07,653 --> 00:59:08,915
We've gone over this
so many times.

1277
00:59:09,051 --> 00:59:10,379
Danny, slow the...
First of all, slow down.

1278
00:59:10,514 --> 00:59:11,850
- Castro...
- My blood pressure high.

1279
00:59:11,985 --> 00:59:13,518
Are you... you good? What's up?

1280
00:59:13,653 --> 00:59:14,823
What? I'm fine!

1281
00:59:20,492 --> 00:59:23,029
Yes, I need your sprayer,
blue paint, and you...

1282
00:59:23,164 --> 00:59:25,429
and meet me at that pin
that I just sent you.

1283
00:59:25,565 --> 00:59:27,395
And I'm going to give you
$10,000 when you get there.

1284
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,201
- You hear me? Blue paint.
- Got you.

1285
00:59:29,336 --> 00:59:30,934
But I'm watching the game
right now, and I got

1286
00:59:31,069 --> 00:59:32,101
money on it, so what's going on?

1287
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:34,110
What, soccer? What? I...

1288
00:59:34,246 --> 00:59:35,536
It's football,

1289
00:59:35,671 --> 00:59:37,110
and it's actually
the most sophisticated

1290
00:59:37,245 --> 00:59:38,449
and the biggest game
in the world, but continue.

1291
00:59:38,584 --> 00:59:40,243
I don't care about
your dumb sport

1292
00:59:40,379 --> 00:59:41,913
- or your dumb ball!
- Okay, I got you.

1293
00:59:42,048 --> 00:59:43,616
Blue paint, sprayer, flamingos.

1294
00:59:43,751 --> 00:59:45,550
No! Not the flamingos!

1295
00:59:45,685 --> 00:59:47,053
Listen! No.

1296
00:59:47,188 --> 00:59:48,788
The blue paint comes
with the spray gun.

1297
00:59:48,923 --> 00:59:51,053
Just leave the flamingos alone!

1298
00:59:51,189 --> 00:59:53,257
They are two separate events!

1299
01:00:00,531 --> 01:00:02,773
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way!

1300
01:00:02,908 --> 01:00:04,739
I'm running low on fluids.
He could use some blood.

1301
01:00:04,874 --> 01:00:06,100
What's the problem now?

1302
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:07,434
I'm O negative, universal.

1303
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:08,807
Oh, my God.
You can donate blood.

1304
01:00:08,943 --> 01:00:10,138
Come here. Come here. Help me.

1305
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:11,746
I will run an IV to your arm,

1306
01:00:11,881 --> 01:00:13,573
and I can just connect you
to him.

1307
01:00:17,048 --> 01:00:18,485
It's almost rush hour.

1308
01:00:18,621 --> 01:00:20,252
We got to wrap this up,

1309
01:00:20,387 --> 01:00:22,121
or a lot of innocent people
are gonna be in danger.

1310
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:28,623
Bank surveillance was corrupted.

1311
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:30,624
They got into the computer.
Oh, they're good.

1312
01:00:30,759 --> 01:00:32,092
FBI database facial rec

1313
01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:33,433
has him as Danny Sharp.

1314
01:00:33,568 --> 01:00:35,464
Holy shit.

1315
01:00:36,475 --> 01:00:39,667
Tell LAPD we want in now.

1316
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,437
Air 64 confirmed off Flower

1317
01:00:41,572 --> 01:00:44,112
to Figueroa, approaching
Convention Center Drive.

1318
01:00:44,248 --> 01:00:46,312
Dhazghig, give me a code 100.
Stagger the units ahead.

1319
01:00:46,448 --> 01:00:49,476
Setting all lights
to green for eastbound Olympic.

1320
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:52,147
So far, RHD cyber found
a sat phone

1321
01:00:52,283 --> 01:00:54,456
and police scanners on board.

1322
01:00:54,591 --> 01:00:56,293
So they're hearing us.

1323
01:00:56,428 --> 01:00:58,157
Well, we'll use that.

1324
01:00:58,292 --> 01:01:00,124
Hey, what's up?
What's happening?

1325
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:02,294
They're gonna try to trap 'em.

1326
01:01:02,429 --> 01:01:04,030
All right, our target's
near Staples Center.

1327
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:05,698
Let's roll.

1328
01:01:05,834 --> 01:01:07,460
Let's roll!

1329
01:01:07,596 --> 01:01:08,968
Hey, that's my car.

1330
01:01:13,444 --> 01:01:14,545
Swap the cars out.

1331
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,977
Get our aggressive guys
up front.

1332
01:01:18,777 --> 01:01:20,984
Jesus.

1333
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,346
Careful.

1334
01:01:28,289 --> 01:01:29,490
Send a unit
to the driver's-side door

1335
01:01:29,626 --> 01:01:30,557
and irritate him a bit.

1336
01:01:30,693 --> 01:01:32,192
They don't lay back,

1337
01:01:32,327 --> 01:01:34,027
we're gonna crash this whole
motherfucking thing!

1338
01:01:34,163 --> 01:01:36,563
Why do you keep
switching the cars around?

1339
01:01:36,698 --> 01:01:38,231
It unnerves them,

1340
01:01:38,367 --> 01:01:39,567
makes them feel like
we're coming from everywhere.

1341
01:01:39,703 --> 01:01:41,366
Switch so he can hear me.

1342
01:01:41,501 --> 01:01:44,336
This is Captain Monroe,
LAPD Special Investigations.

1343
01:01:44,471 --> 01:01:46,505
Okay, well, you need
to tell them to lay back.

1344
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,905
Big message for LAPD...
you pull your helos up and out,

1345
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,539
or I hurt people.

1346
01:01:54,046 --> 01:01:55,344
Who am I speaking with?

1347
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,015
I don't want to call you
Mr. Bank Robber.

1348
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:58,512
Come on, buddy.

1349
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:00,381
There's a Dodgers game
tonight at 7:30.

1350
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:02,024
Ooh, I love Dodger Dogs.

1351
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:03,858
I want to wrap this up
so we can both...

1352
01:02:03,993 --> 01:02:05,829
You get your helos
out of here now!

1353
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:12,228
You don't want me
hurting this cop.

1354
01:02:12,363 --> 01:02:14,530
Why don't you listen to me now?

1355
01:02:14,666 --> 01:02:16,598
<i>You give me my officer
and one paramedic,</i>

1356
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:18,706
<i>not only will I get rid
of the choppers,</i>

1357
01:02:18,841 --> 01:02:20,441
I'll throw in a Dodger Dog.

1358
01:02:20,576 --> 01:02:22,036
What do you say?

1359
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:23,911
This asshole.

1360
01:02:24,046 --> 01:02:26,311
We're a locomotive.
We don't stop.

1361
01:02:27,347 --> 01:02:28,776
Look, I'm not trying
to trick you.

1362
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,114
I don't think
you're getting the message.

1363
01:02:30,249 --> 01:02:32,581
We don't stop!

1364
01:02:33,723 --> 01:02:35,254
Well, neither do we.

1365
01:02:37,919 --> 01:02:39,588
Protecting
our investment, Danny.

1366
01:02:40,697 --> 01:02:42,096
Getting ready right now.

1367
01:02:42,232 --> 01:02:43,894
We're bringing one of our
special cartel builds.

1368
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:45,401
We'll be there, brother.

1369
01:02:45,537 --> 01:02:46,903
Three minutes! Let's go!

1370
01:02:48,374 --> 01:02:50,572
- Papi.
- Jesus.

1371
01:02:50,707 --> 01:02:52,770
Roberto's ready to go.

1372
01:02:52,906 --> 01:02:54,273
Get me a Topo.

1373
01:02:58,049 --> 01:03:01,379
I got this very nice gift
from the Zetas.

1374
01:03:02,586 --> 01:03:04,580
Very charming.

1375
01:03:04,715 --> 01:03:06,286
Seems like
the police are playing

1376
01:03:06,421 --> 01:03:07,581
some sort of cat-and-mouse game
with these suspects...

1377
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:09,487
Let's go watch crazy Danny
on TV.

1378
01:03:09,622 --> 01:03:11,258
Chuck,
as you can see in the studio,

1379
01:03:11,393 --> 01:03:13,125
what's going on right now
is there are a lot of cops

1380
01:03:13,261 --> 01:03:14,630
staggered around
a bunch of blocks

1381
01:03:14,766 --> 01:03:16,263
around the Convention Center.

1382
01:03:16,398 --> 01:03:18,098
We have
a-a massive police presence

1383
01:03:18,233 --> 01:03:19,762
forming around
the Convention Center.

1384
01:03:19,898 --> 01:03:21,497
<i>It's gonna be
a hard one to lock down.</i>

1385
01:03:21,632 --> 01:03:23,434
<i>18, you on for 11?
You available?</i>

1386
01:03:23,569 --> 01:03:24,807
A hundred percent.
Yes. Come on.

1387
01:03:24,942 --> 01:03:26,443
We're gonna trap 'em here.

1388
01:03:26,578 --> 01:03:28,109
Lock this place down.

1389
01:03:28,245 --> 01:03:29,810
We have no visuals
around the corner.

1390
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,688
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1391
01:03:37,823 --> 01:03:39,582
Oh, shit!
They're gonna box us in.

1392
01:03:52,132 --> 01:03:54,432
Just keep it steady, Will.

1393
01:04:04,115 --> 01:04:06,444
Who the hell is this?
I can't shake this guy.

1394
01:04:10,854 --> 01:04:12,846
Jesus. Careful.

1395
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:16,520
Slow down. I'm gonna shoot one.

1396
01:04:19,294 --> 01:04:20,689
- What are you doing?
- Steady.

1397
01:04:21,489 --> 01:04:22,495
I'm right on you.

1398
01:04:22,631 --> 01:04:23,734
No!

1399
01:04:23,869 --> 01:04:25,368
Hey, what... Hey!

1400
01:04:27,963 --> 01:04:29,505
Stop! Goddamn it!

1401
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,332
Stop! You hear me?

1402
01:04:31,468 --> 01:04:33,343
You're gonna hurt someone.

1403
01:04:50,829 --> 01:04:52,160
I'm going inside.

1404
01:04:57,828 --> 01:04:59,332
They're going into
the Convention Center.

1405
01:05:00,839 --> 01:05:02,368
Ah, you got to be kidding me.

1406
01:05:15,051 --> 01:05:16,882
This guy's a hell of a driver.

1407
01:05:17,018 --> 01:05:18,281
Blockade every exit.

1408
01:05:18,416 --> 01:05:20,023
Keep leapfrogging the teams.

1409
01:05:26,257 --> 01:05:27,123
Block 'em in!

1410
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:35,598
Come here.

1411
01:05:35,733 --> 01:05:37,271
I'm gonna teach them a lesson.

1412
01:05:39,742 --> 01:05:41,275
Hey, let her go!

1413
01:05:42,712 --> 01:05:43,974
Get back!

1414
01:05:46,214 --> 01:05:47,942
This boy is certifiable.

1415
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:49,979
- Danny, what's going on back there?
- Get the fuck back!

1416
01:05:50,114 --> 01:05:51,585
Drive!

1417
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,082
Back!

1418
01:05:57,926 --> 01:05:59,595
Back up! Back up!

1419
01:05:59,731 --> 01:06:00,888
I'm not backing up!

1420
01:06:03,799 --> 01:06:05,165
Whoa! Shit!

1421
01:06:05,301 --> 01:06:07,501
Fuck it!

1422
01:06:10,568 --> 01:06:12,101
Who the fuck put you back here?

1423
01:06:13,471 --> 01:06:15,005
Is that my... Is that my...

1424
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:16,611
Is that my dog?

1425
01:06:18,415 --> 01:06:20,611
Who brought my fucking dog
on a police chase?

1426
01:06:20,746 --> 01:06:23,610
And who puts a big-ass dog
in a cop car?

1427
01:06:23,745 --> 01:06:25,787
Pull back, everybody. Pull back.

1428
01:06:25,922 --> 01:06:27,915
Nitro, down. Get down.

1429
01:06:31,659 --> 01:06:34,527
Nitro. Nitro, get down, boy.

1430
01:06:34,663 --> 01:06:37,133
<i>Pull back. Pull back.
It's too dangerous.</i>

1431
01:06:39,633 --> 01:06:41,132
Calm down, Danny.

1432
01:06:41,268 --> 01:06:42,866
I'm pulling everyone back.

1433
01:06:43,001 --> 01:06:45,108
<i>I'm gonna give you some room
so we can talk.</i>

1434
01:06:51,783 --> 01:06:53,182
We're not hurting her.

1435
01:06:53,318 --> 01:06:54,676
Look, I just need them
to think that we will.

1436
01:06:54,812 --> 01:06:56,379
Danny, we are not
hurting her, okay?

1437
01:06:56,515 --> 01:06:58,013
Look, I'm not him. I'm not LT.

1438
01:06:58,148 --> 01:06:59,987
I don't know how many times
I have to tell you that.

1439
01:07:00,122 --> 01:07:02,820
You shot a cop, an LAPD cop.

1440
01:07:02,956 --> 01:07:05,161
Okay? They're gonna kill us
the first chance that they get.

1441
01:07:05,296 --> 01:07:07,161
So forget about her.
It's all about him.

1442
01:07:07,297 --> 01:07:09,132
He is the reason
that we're alive.

1443
01:07:11,965 --> 01:07:13,734
<i>Suspects are now
southbound on the 110 freeway</i>

1444
01:07:13,869 --> 01:07:16,064
<i>at a high rate of speed.</i>

1445
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,499
<i>L.A. 5-0.
They can extend the Sigalert</i>

1446
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:19,567
<i>for one more hour.</i>

1447
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:23,675
<i>This is Sky 4. As you can see,</i>

1448
01:07:23,810 --> 01:07:25,715
<i>Highway Patrol, uh,
out on the forefront</i>

1449
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:27,349
<i>stopping, uh, traffic,</i>

1450
01:07:27,484 --> 01:07:28,911
<i>trying to close, uh,
the highway down.</i>

1451
01:07:29,046 --> 01:07:31,682
Several helos are following
these two suspects.

1452
01:07:31,817 --> 01:07:34,521
And with police cars
in pursuit, it just...

1453
01:07:34,656 --> 01:07:36,724
I don't know how much longer
these two suspects

1454
01:07:36,859 --> 01:07:38,027
can, uh, go on.

1455
01:07:38,162 --> 01:07:39,356
Uh, got to wonder
what's going on

1456
01:07:39,492 --> 01:07:40,823
through the minds of these...

1457
01:07:42,663 --> 01:07:44,198
You know that feeling
when you're a kid

1458
01:07:44,334 --> 01:07:46,101
playing hide-and-seek...

1459
01:07:46,236 --> 01:07:47,737
...and you're about
to get caught?

1460
01:07:47,872 --> 01:07:49,370
Mm-hmm.

1461
01:07:49,506 --> 01:07:51,871
I'm real good at making people
feel that way.

1462
01:07:52,006 --> 01:07:54,701
<i>This, uh... just
such a crazy day. It just...</i>

1463
01:07:54,836 --> 01:07:56,209
<i>It reminds me of, uh, years ago</i>

1464
01:07:56,344 --> 01:07:57,575
<i>the North Hollywood shoot-out.</i>

1465
01:07:57,710 --> 01:07:59,549
<i>Suspects are southbound</i>

1466
01:07:59,684 --> 01:08:01,679
on the 110 freeway, approaching
Manchester in the ExpressLane.

1467
01:08:09,557 --> 01:08:10,853
Where's that blood coming from?

1468
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:14,723
No.

1469
01:08:14,859 --> 01:08:17,057
Where's it coming from?
Shit.

1470
01:08:20,071 --> 01:08:22,402
- You shot him twice.
- No.

1471
01:08:22,538 --> 01:08:24,097
- What's going on?
- He's bleeding out.

1472
01:08:29,737 --> 01:08:31,709
Finally.

1473
01:08:33,708 --> 01:08:35,108
Feds.

1474
01:08:35,243 --> 01:08:37,251
I'm Captain Monroe.
You're wasting my time.

1475
01:08:37,387 --> 01:08:39,823
Why didn't S.I.S.
hit the robbery?

1476
01:08:39,958 --> 01:08:41,256
Oh, that's old-school S.I.S.

1477
01:08:41,392 --> 01:08:43,093
That'll get you shoot-outs
and kidnappings.

1478
01:08:43,228 --> 01:08:44,484
Yeah. We hit 'em
when they come out.

1479
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,987
Oh, wonderful.

1480
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,427
Well, that's working out
real well, huh, guys?

1481
01:08:47,563 --> 01:08:49,794
Are you from L.A.,
Special Agent Clark,

1482
01:08:49,929 --> 01:08:51,599
with your suspenders
and looking like you're 20?

1483
01:08:53,397 --> 01:08:55,267
20? No, Toledo.

1484
01:08:55,402 --> 01:08:56,667
Oh, great, another tourist.

1485
01:08:56,803 --> 01:08:58,441
Okay, can we just
skip over the whole

1486
01:08:58,576 --> 01:09:00,473
"I don't know shit and
you fought in Vietnam" speech?

1487
01:09:00,608 --> 01:09:02,812
How old do you think I am, man?

1488
01:09:02,948 --> 01:09:05,106
Look, I can help you here.

1489
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:07,008
This isn't a bank robbery.
It's a hostage situation.

1490
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:09,318
- Oh, it's far worse than that, sir.
- What?

1491
01:09:09,453 --> 01:09:11,117
The guy who held your paramedic
out the back

1492
01:09:11,252 --> 01:09:12,617
is named Danny Sharp.

1493
01:09:12,753 --> 01:09:14,621
Danny's been robbing banks
since he was 17.

1494
01:09:14,756 --> 01:09:17,492
His father LT was a legend,
bona fide psychotic.

1495
01:09:17,628 --> 01:09:20,190
Killed six bank managers,
two tellers in the '90s.

1496
01:09:20,325 --> 01:09:21,821
Oh, tremendous.

1497
01:09:21,956 --> 01:09:23,465
Well, he is causing a shitstorm.

1498
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,497
- Oh, wonderful, FBI.
- Oh, great.

1499
01:09:25,633 --> 01:09:27,169
We could run a mini war
from in here.

1500
01:09:27,305 --> 01:09:29,297
Plus, RHD can stagger
our assets.

1501
01:09:29,432 --> 01:09:32,141
Wade, tell D-Team to get ready.
We're gonna trap this fucker.

1502
01:09:32,276 --> 01:09:33,501
- Roger that. On it, boss.
- Don't.

1503
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:34,840
That is a mistake.

1504
01:09:34,976 --> 01:09:35,978
Why?

1505
01:09:36,113 --> 01:09:37,311
Danny is a different breed.

1506
01:09:37,446 --> 01:09:38,708
He could've easily
killed your cop

1507
01:09:38,843 --> 01:09:40,139
back there at the bank,
but he didn't.

1508
01:09:40,275 --> 01:09:42,852
All right?
He is looking for a way out.

1509
01:09:42,987 --> 01:09:44,518
How do you know that?

1510
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:47,785
We used to be friends.

1511
01:09:48,859 --> 01:09:50,155
Let's roll.

1512
01:09:50,291 --> 01:09:51,661
Get this bitch rolling!

1513
01:09:57,669 --> 01:09:59,401
We'll be there in a few.
You just-just stay there.

1514
01:09:59,537 --> 01:10:00,864
- We'll be there in a few.
- Y-You're just

1515
01:10:00,999 --> 01:10:02,332
more uptight
than you normally are, man.

1516
01:10:02,468 --> 01:10:03,401
You know, I don't know.

1517
01:10:03,536 --> 01:10:04,567
Uh, everything is gonna be okay.

1518
01:10:04,703 --> 01:10:05,832
I got your... I got the spray.

1519
01:10:05,967 --> 01:10:07,167
I got the flamingos that landed.

1520
01:10:07,302 --> 01:10:08,738
Counted them by hand,
all of that, man.

1521
01:10:08,874 --> 01:10:10,179
Okay? So everything
will be fine.

1522
01:10:10,315 --> 01:10:11,510
You just got to take
a deep breath,

1523
01:10:11,646 --> 01:10:12,513
'cause you
stressing me out, man.

1524
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,550
Hey, Toledo.
So you're telling me

1525
01:10:17,686 --> 01:10:19,346
you went to college
with Danny Sharp?

1526
01:10:19,482 --> 01:10:21,421
I was getting my doctorate
in criminology at Maryland.

1527
01:10:21,557 --> 01:10:23,224
Ooh, you're a regular
Doogie Howser.

1528
01:10:23,359 --> 01:10:24,889
Don't know who that is, boomer.

1529
01:10:25,025 --> 01:10:27,028
So, what, they were bringing
criminals in to study?

1530
01:10:27,164 --> 01:10:29,195
No. He was in the program.

1531
01:10:29,331 --> 01:10:30,865
He was there to study us.

1532
01:10:31,001 --> 01:10:32,762
Daddy's idea.

1533
01:10:32,898 --> 01:10:34,398
Yeah, he lasted
about two semesters,

1534
01:10:34,534 --> 01:10:36,372
took every class he could.

1535
01:10:36,508 --> 01:10:39,242
Then, one night,
after sharing a bottle of rosé,

1536
01:10:39,378 --> 01:10:40,568
telling each other
bad-father stories,

1537
01:10:40,704 --> 01:10:41,869
poof, he disappears.

1538
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:43,947
- Rosé? Ugh.
- Yeah, rosé.

1539
01:10:44,082 --> 01:10:45,381
You got a problem with that?

1540
01:10:45,516 --> 01:10:47,383
- It's just gross.
- I like rosé.

1541
01:10:47,519 --> 01:10:50,611
In the last ten years,
he's robbed 37 banks.

1542
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,419
No, make that 38.

1543
01:10:52,555 --> 01:10:55,386
- That's good.
- How is that good?

1544
01:10:55,522 --> 01:10:57,452
'Cause he'll talk to you.

1545
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:01,723
- Prognosis?
- He needs an OR.

1546
01:11:01,858 --> 01:11:03,399
He doesn't need more blood.

1547
01:11:03,535 --> 01:11:05,135
He needs a doctor
that knows what he's doing

1548
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:06,398
to open him up,
stop the bleeding.

1549
01:11:06,533 --> 01:11:08,130
I don't know how to do this.

1550
01:11:08,266 --> 01:11:10,065
All right, so call one.
Have him talk you through it.

1551
01:11:11,908 --> 01:11:13,108
No.

1552
01:11:13,243 --> 01:11:14,967
Mm-mm. No, no, no. I can't.

1553
01:11:15,103 --> 01:11:16,610
Wh-Why is the answer no

1554
01:11:16,745 --> 01:11:18,107
- when it has to be yes?
- No, because I'm not...

1555
01:11:18,242 --> 01:11:19,746
- Know someone in your ER?
- I'm not qualified.

1556
01:11:19,881 --> 01:11:22,082
Yeah, doctors, doctors...
All right, Dr. Franken?

1557
01:11:22,217 --> 01:11:23,313
- Huh?
- No.

1558
01:11:23,449 --> 01:11:24,579
Dr. Williams?

1559
01:11:24,714 --> 01:11:25,920
That's my shrink.

1560
01:11:26,055 --> 01:11:27,418
Dr. Waters?

1561
01:11:27,554 --> 01:11:29,455
What is that picture from?

1562
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:32,560
What is that, Cancún? McDreamy.

1563
01:11:33,558 --> 01:11:35,398
Colin Waters.

1564
01:11:37,402 --> 01:11:39,459
- Where's he work?
- At Mount Sinai.

1565
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:41,935
- All right, I'm calling him.
- I-I can't do this. Please.

1566
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:43,930
- Yes, you can. You're gonna do some doctor shit.
- Please.

1567
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:46,266
Yes, you can.

1568
01:11:46,401 --> 01:11:47,944
Yeah, I'm microwaving.
Hold on a sec.

1569
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,940
Loud, yeah?

1570
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,114
- Colin, it's me.
- Hey, Cam.

1571
01:11:54,249 --> 01:11:55,678
It's been a while.

1572
01:11:55,814 --> 01:11:57,278
I know. It's been six months.

1573
01:11:57,413 --> 01:11:58,983
Yeah, listen, uh,
this isn't really a good time.

1574
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:01,122
- I'm on my way to work.
- I need you to walk me through

1575
01:12:01,257 --> 01:12:02,855
a GSW to the abdomen.

1576
01:12:02,991 --> 01:12:04,623
What are you talking about?
You're not a surgeon.

1577
01:12:04,759 --> 01:12:06,959
You can't do that.
You're an EMT.

1578
01:12:07,095 --> 01:12:10,794
Yeah, I fucking know that,
Colin, but I have a situation.

1579
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:12,131
Situation? What situation?

1580
01:12:12,267 --> 01:12:13,799
I'm a hostage.

1581
01:12:14,796 --> 01:12:16,296
Oh, shit.

1582
01:12:16,431 --> 01:12:18,305
That thing in L.A.?
You're in the ambulance?

1583
01:12:18,441 --> 01:12:20,534
- Colin.
- Yeah. Who's this?

1584
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:23,402
Yeah, I'm the guy who's gonna
kill her if you don't help us.

1585
01:12:24,605 --> 01:12:26,339
Okay, no, no, no, no.
All right, don't hurt her.

1586
01:12:26,474 --> 01:12:28,541
Cam, give me his stats.
Tell me what you see.

1587
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,983
His vitals are dropping fast.
He's losing blood. I'm...

1588
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:32,650
<i>I'm gonna call
some trauma guys. Hang on.</i>

1589
01:12:32,785 --> 01:12:33,951
What's up, Colin?

1590
01:12:35,016 --> 01:12:36,325
Farcy!

1591
01:12:36,461 --> 01:12:38,226
You got to pair my phone
to the screen.

1592
01:12:38,361 --> 01:12:39,523
He needs to see the surgery.

1593
01:12:39,659 --> 01:12:41,063
Dr. Resnick and Dr. Farcy.

1594
01:12:41,198 --> 01:12:43,032
We're trauma surgeons.

1595
01:12:43,168 --> 01:12:45,160
Hey, Cam. What do you got?

1596
01:12:48,304 --> 01:12:49,670
Surgeons are walking her

1597
01:12:49,805 --> 01:12:51,340
through an operation
to remove the bullet.

1598
01:12:51,476 --> 01:12:53,199
- Come again?
- RHD are on with her,

1599
01:12:53,335 --> 01:12:54,839
with doctors
on with her right now.

1600
01:12:54,975 --> 01:12:57,041
Do you hear
what's going on right now?

1601
01:12:57,176 --> 01:12:59,042
Cam, what's the vital sign,
blood pressure, pulse?

1602
01:12:59,177 --> 01:13:00,345
It's not good.
I'm sending through.

1603
01:13:00,481 --> 01:13:02,184
Vitals are crashing.

1604
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:03,486
We need to start working faster.

1605
01:13:05,484 --> 01:13:06,489
Hey, Danny!

1606
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:09,185
Yeah?

1607
01:13:09,321 --> 01:13:10,920
- Come and switch with me, man. I've done...
- What?

1608
01:13:11,056 --> 01:13:12,594
I've done this before.
I can help.

1609
01:13:12,730 --> 01:13:14,356
All right, Cam,
these are trauma docs.

1610
01:13:14,491 --> 01:13:15,762
We're all gonna help.
What do you got for supplies?

1611
01:13:15,897 --> 01:13:18,193
Yeah, I got everything
but no anesthesia.

1612
01:13:25,341 --> 01:13:27,210
- Will.
- What?

1613
01:13:27,345 --> 01:13:28,874
Don't forget she's the hostage.

1614
01:13:29,009 --> 01:13:30,536
All right,
show us what you got.

1615
01:13:30,671 --> 01:13:32,910
You can see the abdominal area
is really swollen.

1616
01:13:33,046 --> 01:13:34,750
I'm thinking there's
internal bleeding.

1617
01:13:36,677 --> 01:13:37,912
He's likely
bleeding out from the spleen.

1618
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:40,219
Hey. Do you have EMT experience?

1619
01:13:40,355 --> 01:13:41,917
Combat triage.

1620
01:13:42,052 --> 01:13:43,553
- I can follow orders.
- Good.

1621
01:13:43,688 --> 01:13:45,352
You're a soldier?

1622
01:13:46,524 --> 01:13:47,930
Yeah.

1623
01:13:48,066 --> 01:13:49,898
Gloves. Move.

1624
01:13:50,033 --> 01:13:51,597
Sir, did you shoot him
with an AR or with a handgun?

1625
01:13:51,732 --> 01:13:52,930
You got to slow down.

1626
01:13:53,066 --> 01:13:54,401
We're about to do
surgery right here.

1627
01:13:54,537 --> 01:13:56,565
We're a shark. We don't stop.

1628
01:14:02,244 --> 01:14:03,575
Well, hey, pal.

1629
01:14:03,710 --> 01:14:05,413
Nice to see you haven't changed.

1630
01:14:05,548 --> 01:14:07,073
Oh, my God.

1631
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:09,581
You got time for an old buddy?

1632
01:14:09,717 --> 01:14:11,413
Well, I recognize that voice.

1633
01:14:11,549 --> 01:14:13,446
If you're calling me, you're
the head of Bank Division.

1634
01:14:13,581 --> 01:14:15,823
It's about time.
It's always been your destiny.

1635
01:14:15,959 --> 01:14:17,450
<i>I guess you're wondering
why we're slowed down.</i>

1636
01:14:17,585 --> 01:14:18,990
I'm actually wondering
why you would ever

1637
01:14:19,126 --> 01:14:20,594
put yourself in this situation
to begin with,

1638
01:14:20,729 --> 01:14:22,092
but sure, yeah,
let's start there.

1639
01:14:22,228 --> 01:14:23,665
We're just trying to keep
a cop alive back here.

1640
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,658
- It's a little tense.
- Camille can't do this.

1641
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:27,766
- She's not a doctor.
- Yeah, no shit she's not a doctor.

1642
01:14:27,901 --> 01:14:29,802
She's actually competent.
Listen.

1643
01:14:29,938 --> 01:14:31,099
- Danny, Danny, Danny...
- Uh, I got to go,

1644
01:14:31,235 --> 01:14:32,342
but, uh, I-I'll drop you
a line sometime.

1645
01:14:32,477 --> 01:14:34,303
- We got to catch up.
- Oh, yeah?

1646
01:14:34,438 --> 01:14:35,840
Well, I got a funny feeling
you're about to have

1647
01:14:35,976 --> 01:14:37,604
a lot of free time
on your hands.

1648
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:39,680
Mm. Yeah, on a tropical island.
I'll send you a postcard.

1649
01:14:39,816 --> 01:14:41,308
Yeah. Who's the other guy,
your driver?

1650
01:14:41,444 --> 01:14:43,150
Get a pen and paper.
Write this on it:

1651
01:14:43,285 --> 01:14:44,587
Fuck off!

1652
01:14:46,758 --> 01:14:49,449
Poke a hole in the skin,
then take the scissors.

1653
01:14:49,584 --> 01:14:51,654
I need you to open him up.
Open the skin.

1654
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:53,457
Here we go. Here we go.

1655
01:14:53,592 --> 01:14:55,290
I got it.

1656
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:57,695
I'm going for the skin.

1657
01:14:57,830 --> 01:14:59,963
Okay, I'm cutting, cutting skin.

1658
01:15:00,098 --> 01:15:01,796
Out of the fucking way! Look...

1659
01:15:01,932 --> 01:15:03,797
We're an ambulance!

1660
01:15:03,933 --> 01:15:05,301
Skin is open.

1661
01:15:05,436 --> 01:15:07,873
Then you and your
criminal friend right there

1662
01:15:08,008 --> 01:15:10,304
put both of your hands
in the wound,

1663
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:13,110
and I need you to spread
the muscle apart.

1664
01:15:14,818 --> 01:15:17,046
Man, the way people drive
in this city.

1665
01:15:17,182 --> 01:15:18,686
- Stop yelling.
- Slow down.

1666
01:15:18,822 --> 01:15:22,020
You cannot do this
at 60 miles an hour.

1667
01:15:22,155 --> 01:15:23,657
Just pull it
like a rubber band.

1668
01:15:23,793 --> 01:15:25,689
- You have four minutes to do this.
- Go.

1669
01:15:25,825 --> 01:15:27,327
Okay, and pull.

1670
01:15:27,463 --> 01:15:29,159
Pull, pull, pull, pull.

1671
01:15:30,966 --> 01:15:32,365
I need you to blunt-dissect
with your hand.

1672
01:15:32,501 --> 01:15:34,000
All right? Totally down.

1673
01:15:34,135 --> 01:15:35,371
- You're doing good.
- Slow down, Danny.

1674
01:15:35,506 --> 01:15:36,738
Danny, I need you to slow down.

1675
01:15:36,873 --> 01:15:38,340
How about we all just
get out and walk?

1676
01:15:38,476 --> 01:15:39,869
Get... Danny, just give me 20!

1677
01:15:40,005 --> 01:15:41,341
Now is not the time to argue!

1678
01:15:41,477 --> 01:15:42,843
This is as slow as I go.

1679
01:15:42,979 --> 01:15:44,572
- I need you to slow down, man!
- Slower.

1680
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:46,408
We're playing live Operation
back here. Just slow down!

1681
01:15:46,543 --> 01:15:49,248
This is gonna be the slowest
cop chase in the world.

1682
01:15:49,383 --> 01:15:51,013
- Lots of crazy shit going on back here!
- Just shut up!

1683
01:15:51,148 --> 01:15:52,378
- Just... Okay.
- Shit.

1684
01:15:52,514 --> 01:15:55,850
Tell everyone to calm
the fuck down.

1685
01:15:55,986 --> 01:15:57,019
What are you doing?

1686
01:15:57,154 --> 01:15:59,024
The aorta. Yeah, I can feel it.

1687
01:15:59,159 --> 01:16:01,220
I need you to squeeze it now.
Squeeze it hard

1688
01:16:01,355 --> 01:16:02,528
to stop the blood to the spleen.

1689
01:16:02,664 --> 01:16:04,195
God, I'm trying.

1690
01:16:04,330 --> 01:16:06,060
You're do... you're doing good.
You're doing good.

1691
01:16:06,195 --> 01:16:07,835
It's working. It's working.

1692
01:16:11,338 --> 01:16:13,600
Drop down to 20 miles an hour.
Give 'em some distance.

1693
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:16,239
<i>She's operating
on our brother right now.</i>

1694
01:16:17,342 --> 01:16:18,708
Cam,
his blood pressure's dropping.

1695
01:16:18,844 --> 01:16:20,215
He's about to code.

1696
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:21,782
Palpate for the bullet.

1697
01:16:21,918 --> 01:16:23,211
- You got it.
- Okay.

1698
01:16:23,347 --> 01:16:24,581
It should be a sharp object.

1699
01:16:24,716 --> 01:16:26,121
Okay.

1700
01:16:26,256 --> 01:16:27,452
I can't find it.

1701
01:16:30,856 --> 01:16:33,060
- Oh, God.
- What?

1702
01:16:33,196 --> 01:16:35,221
It's on the spleen. Colin,
it's pressed onto the spleen.

1703
01:16:35,356 --> 01:16:37,064
What do I do? What do I do?

1704
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,558
- I've never done this before.
- Okay, Cam, Cam, Cam, Cam.

1705
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:40,059
Calm down. I need you
to show me the spleen.

1706
01:16:40,195 --> 01:16:41,738
I need to visualize it.

1707
01:16:41,873 --> 01:16:43,234
- Where's he bleeding from?
- Hey, look at me.

1708
01:16:43,369 --> 01:16:44,440
- You're just nervous, okay? That's it.
- Okay.

1709
01:16:44,575 --> 01:16:45,807
- You're just nervous.
- Okay.

1710
01:16:45,942 --> 01:16:46,903
My wife, she gets nervous
all the time.

1711
01:16:47,038 --> 01:16:47,737
You know what we do? We breathe.

1712
01:16:47,872 --> 01:16:49,074
You're doing good.

1713
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:50,479
Okay, I got it, I got it.

1714
01:16:50,614 --> 01:16:52,911
I think he's waking up.

1715
01:16:53,047 --> 01:16:54,580
I think he's waking up.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1716
01:16:54,715 --> 01:16:56,114
He is fully awake. Oh!

1717
01:16:56,249 --> 01:16:58,253
- Hold him down. I'm in his gut!
- Yeah, yeah.

1718
01:16:58,388 --> 01:16:59,319
I think he knows.

1719
01:17:00,724 --> 01:17:02,120
- Stop.
- He's fully awake!

1720
01:17:02,255 --> 01:17:03,416
- Oh, my God. This is insane.
- That's insane.

1721
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:04,923
- Stop him, Will.
- Trying to save you.

1722
01:17:05,059 --> 01:17:06,419
No! Hey, whoa, whoa.

1723
01:17:06,555 --> 01:17:08,792
Just trying to help out.
Stop. Stop.

1724
01:17:08,928 --> 01:17:10,794
We are trying to save you.

1725
01:17:10,929 --> 01:17:13,598
Oh, sh... Go to sleep!

1726
01:17:13,734 --> 01:17:15,430
What are you doing?!

1727
01:17:17,073 --> 01:17:19,265
I-I let you back there
for like five minutes,

1728
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,441
and now you're punching the cop?

1729
01:17:20,577 --> 01:17:22,074
That worked.

1730
01:17:25,644 --> 01:17:28,183
- Is... is he out?
- Yeah, he's out, he's out, he's out.

1731
01:17:32,088 --> 01:17:33,615
<i>All right,
all right, listen to me.</i>

1732
01:17:33,751 --> 01:17:36,283
The spleen has an artery
attached to the bottom of it.

1733
01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:38,283
You need to pull it out slowly.

1734
01:17:38,419 --> 01:17:39,859
Pull the spleen.

1735
01:17:39,994 --> 01:17:41,461
Gentle.
I don't want it to burst.

1736
01:17:41,597 --> 01:17:43,130
Cam, you can do it.

1737
01:17:43,265 --> 01:17:44,960
- Gentle. Don't let him die.
- You got it, you got it.

1738
01:17:45,096 --> 01:17:47,364
It's coming out.

1739
01:17:47,499 --> 01:17:50,196
Colin, if this spleen ruptures,
he's got 60 seconds.

1740
01:17:50,331 --> 01:17:51,306
I got it.

1741
01:17:51,441 --> 01:17:53,032
I'm gonna grab it.

1742
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:54,804
I got it. Okay.

1743
01:17:54,939 --> 01:17:55,974
I'm taking it out.

1744
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:57,808
I got the bullet.
It's coming out.

1745
01:17:57,944 --> 01:17:59,479
Okay, I've almost got it.

1746
01:17:59,615 --> 01:18:01,844
I've almost got it.

1747
01:18:01,979 --> 01:18:03,348
It's out. It's...

1748
01:18:05,316 --> 01:18:07,990
Oh, God. It burst.
It burst, Colin.

1749
01:18:08,126 --> 01:18:09,992
What do I do? I don't know
what to do in this situation.

1750
01:18:10,128 --> 01:18:11,493
You got to clamp that right
now. He's gonna bleed out.

1751
01:18:11,628 --> 01:18:13,159
I-I used all the fucking clamps!

1752
01:18:13,294 --> 01:18:14,564
- I don't have anything to clamp it.
- Hey, hey,

1753
01:18:14,699 --> 01:18:16,027
hey, hey, hey!
Look at me. Look at me.

1754
01:18:16,163 --> 01:18:17,057
Listen. Listen.
Do you know what we do?

1755
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:18,824
We breathe. Okay?

1756
01:18:18,959 --> 01:18:20,526
- That's all. We just breathe, okay?
- Okay. I got it.

1757
01:18:20,661 --> 01:18:22,070
Clamp. I got to clamp it.

1758
01:18:22,205 --> 01:18:24,036
I got a clamp in my hair.
I got a clamp in my hair.

1759
01:18:24,171 --> 01:18:25,564
Grab it, grab it,
grab it, grab it.

1760
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,074
Okay. You got to clamp
underneath.

1761
01:18:27,209 --> 01:18:29,172
You got to clamp the artery.
Fast, fast, fast.

1762
01:18:29,308 --> 01:18:32,639
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1763
01:18:33,647 --> 01:18:35,008
It worked.

1764
01:18:35,143 --> 01:18:36,478
Oh, shit.

1765
01:18:37,522 --> 01:18:39,353
Did it work?

1766
01:18:39,488 --> 01:18:41,589
It worked.

1767
01:18:41,725 --> 01:18:43,853
Oh, shit.

1768
01:18:43,989 --> 01:18:45,718
This shit is crazy.

1769
01:18:45,853 --> 01:18:47,863
Yeah, we're doing crazy today.

1770
01:18:54,497 --> 01:18:56,905
Does your wife know
you rob banks?

1771
01:19:01,543 --> 01:19:03,076
Why you asking?

1772
01:19:05,406 --> 01:19:07,942
Situational awareness.

1773
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:09,384
That's all.

1774
01:19:09,519 --> 01:19:11,548
Let's tape him up.

1775
01:19:13,687 --> 01:19:16,125
<i>Why they have slowed
down to 20 miles an hour...</i>

1776
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:19,560
<i>because that heroic EMT
in the back of that ambulance,</i>

1777
01:19:19,695 --> 01:19:21,122
<i>Camille Thompson,</i>

1778
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:22,731
is performing surgery

1779
01:19:22,867 --> 01:19:25,425
on that officer,
trying to save his life.

1780
01:19:25,561 --> 01:19:26,901
- Hey.
- How you doing?

1781
01:19:27,036 --> 01:19:28,736
We're good here. How about you?

1782
01:19:28,871 --> 01:19:30,068
Yeah, no, we're good.

1783
01:19:30,204 --> 01:19:32,435
We're good.

1784
01:19:33,911 --> 01:19:35,601
We're bringing
some party favors:

1785
01:19:35,737 --> 01:19:37,771
C-4, special package,
Papi's gift.

1786
01:19:37,907 --> 01:19:39,911
Hey, yeah, listen to me.
We're just trying to get away.

1787
01:19:40,046 --> 01:19:41,244
We're not trying to start a war.

1788
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:43,247
Can't believe
what we got for you.

1789
01:19:43,383 --> 01:19:45,248
Tell Papi
I appreciate it, all right?

1790
01:19:45,384 --> 01:19:47,480
Just protecting
our investment, Danny.

1791
01:19:47,615 --> 01:19:49,925
We roll strong. We're <i>familia.</i>

1792
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:54,162
<i>Hey, Will.</i>

1793
01:19:54,298 --> 01:19:56,623
<i>Your big brother
is making moves!</i>

1794
01:19:56,758 --> 01:19:58,996
So you and that doctor, Colin?

1795
01:19:59,131 --> 01:20:01,464
Yeah. We met at med school.

1796
01:20:01,599 --> 01:20:04,302
I made it to my third year
of residency.

1797
01:20:05,807 --> 01:20:07,976
I got addicted to speed.

1798
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:10,913
And I blew it.

1799
01:20:11,912 --> 01:20:14,515
And now I'm here, so...

1800
01:20:14,650 --> 01:20:16,446
What about Colin?

1801
01:20:17,483 --> 01:20:19,182
Well, I found a way
to screw that up, too.

1802
01:20:19,317 --> 01:20:20,681
Hey, get out of the way!

1803
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:22,682
Mm, mm. Yeah,
I know what you mean. Shit.

1804
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,023
Out of the way!
Will, you got to drive!

1805
01:20:25,158 --> 01:20:26,958
- Get back up here.
- Hey.

1806
01:20:27,094 --> 01:20:29,462
I'm gonna get you out of this.

1807
01:20:29,597 --> 01:20:31,263
Okay?

1808
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:35,102
Yes?

1809
01:20:38,605 --> 01:20:40,839
I got cut off as the officer's
spleen was rupturing.

1810
01:20:40,974 --> 01:20:42,840
Bottom-line it for me.

1811
01:20:42,975 --> 01:20:44,643
Is our guy alive?

1812
01:20:44,778 --> 01:20:46,477
I just told you.

1813
01:20:46,613 --> 01:20:49,147
It's a tough procedure,
even for the best of doctors.

1814
01:20:49,282 --> 01:20:51,149
She tried her best.

1815
01:20:51,285 --> 01:20:52,386
Chief's on the line.

1816
01:20:52,521 --> 01:20:54,323
Chief?

1817
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:56,148
Our guy's dead.

1818
01:20:56,283 --> 01:20:57,851
Yeah.

1819
01:20:57,987 --> 01:21:00,559
These sons of bitches
about to have a really bad day.

1820
01:21:00,694 --> 01:21:03,692
Hey, Will, I got on the 105,
a-and I headed to the airport.

1821
01:21:03,827 --> 01:21:05,661
- Really? The 105?
- I don't know what fucking happened.

1822
01:21:05,796 --> 01:21:07,398
- How did you get to the 105?
- I don't know, man!

1823
01:21:07,534 --> 01:21:09,038
There's so much shit going on!
If we just...

1824
01:21:09,173 --> 01:21:10,666
Do you know how many cops
are at the airport, Danny?

1825
01:21:10,801 --> 01:21:11,974
Know how to get...
How can we get back Downtown?

1826
01:21:20,681 --> 01:21:23,014
They're on the 105,
heading toward the airport.

1827
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:25,350
Give me a code 100 for D-Team.

1828
01:21:25,485 --> 01:21:28,087
Have 'em jump ahead
to the 105-405 overpass.

1829
01:21:28,222 --> 01:21:30,082
Leapfrog the teams
if you have to.

1830
01:21:30,217 --> 01:21:32,223
I got a plan I've been working
for about 45 minutes.

1831
01:21:32,359 --> 01:21:33,921
You need to take me
to this bridge.

1832
01:21:34,056 --> 01:21:36,530
Olympic Bridge... you know it,
along the L.A. River.

1833
01:21:36,665 --> 01:21:39,694
<i>Everybody converge
at the 105-405 interchange.</i>

1834
01:21:40,696 --> 01:21:42,762
- You should wait.
- For what?

1835
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:45,038
They won't talk.
They won't negotiate.

1836
01:21:45,174 --> 01:21:47,042
What am I supposed to do,
FBI boy?

1837
01:21:47,177 --> 01:21:49,011
All right, for one,
cut the "boy" shit.

1838
01:21:50,571 --> 01:21:51,876
<i>Chief wants this.</i>

1839
01:21:52,011 --> 01:21:53,275
Mayor wants this.

1840
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:55,384
He's a Silver Lake liberal.

1841
01:21:55,519 --> 01:21:57,242
What's the move?

1842
01:21:57,378 --> 01:21:58,918
Remember that place we used to
boost cars by the L.A. River?

1843
01:21:59,053 --> 01:22:00,252
I need you to take me there.

1844
01:22:00,388 --> 01:22:01,714
Olympic Bridge is
right next to where

1845
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:03,422
we used to ditch
and scatter cops.

1846
01:22:03,557 --> 01:22:05,221
Want to take 'em on
a Kobe-to-Shaq alley-oop?

1847
01:22:05,356 --> 01:22:07,225
We'll shake 'em. All right?

1848
01:22:07,361 --> 01:22:08,898
We didn't necessarily
steal a Jag.

1849
01:22:09,033 --> 01:22:10,455
I can't do those moves
in this thing.

1850
01:22:10,591 --> 01:22:12,232
You can do anything.

1851
01:22:12,367 --> 01:22:14,565
You can do anything.
You don't need a Jag.

1852
01:22:14,701 --> 01:22:17,103
Fuck it. Leave 'em in the dust
just like the old days.

1853
01:22:17,239 --> 01:22:18,463
Then I'll get us
right by the bridge.

1854
01:22:18,599 --> 01:22:20,273
I'm gonna take you home.

1855
01:22:26,711 --> 01:22:28,941
All right, let's go. Fan out!

1856
01:22:30,249 --> 01:22:31,919
We got to think about this.

1857
01:22:32,054 --> 01:22:33,919
There's nothing to think about.

1858
01:22:34,055 --> 01:22:35,917
Nobody gets to kill a cop.

1859
01:22:36,053 --> 01:22:38,390
<i>We're herding them into a place
that's already prepped.</i>

1860
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:41,823
<i>D-Team is taking them out
simultaneously.</i>

1861
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:44,891
<i>They're gonna be dead
in three minutes.</i>

1862
01:22:46,596 --> 01:22:48,264
This might be our last chance.

1863
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,937
Blockade every exit. Push 'em.

1864
01:22:51,073 --> 01:22:52,603
The paramedic is still alive.

1865
01:22:52,738 --> 01:22:54,768
<i>And I want
to keep her that way.</i>

1866
01:22:54,903 --> 01:22:56,640
<i>Coming at us about 65,</i>

1867
01:22:56,775 --> 01:22:58,939
<i>70 miles an hour,
about a minute out.</i>

1868
01:22:59,075 --> 01:23:01,942
- What are your odds?
- Well, it's not 100%.

1869
01:23:02,077 --> 01:23:03,945
She's in the back, sir.
It'll have to be head shots.

1870
01:23:04,081 --> 01:23:06,486
Then we've got a ground team
that'll come in and sweep it up.

1871
01:23:06,622 --> 01:23:08,116
Give me your odds.
What are the chances, Dyle?

1872
01:23:08,251 --> 01:23:10,454
80, 90 percent.

1873
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:13,124
No more waiting.
Wait broke the wagon.

1874
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:14,856
D-Team, that's a green light.

1875
01:23:14,991 --> 01:23:17,266
You got to negotiate her out.
This is a mistake.

1876
01:23:18,102 --> 01:23:20,631
<i>This is a mistake, Toledo?</i>

1877
01:23:20,767 --> 01:23:22,929
- Not your buddy killing a cop?
- He's not my buddy.

1878
01:23:27,001 --> 01:23:28,540
Why haven't they tried
to stop us?

1879
01:23:28,676 --> 01:23:30,043
<i>'Cause our lucky
rookie cop is on board.</i>

1880
01:23:30,178 --> 01:23:31,973
Mobile unit is in position now.

1881
01:23:32,109 --> 01:23:34,179
<i>Hey, we got to turn around.</i>

1882
01:23:34,314 --> 01:23:36,118
<i>We got to get back Downtown.</i>

1883
01:23:38,117 --> 01:23:39,647
Zach's phone.

1884
01:23:39,783 --> 01:23:41,147
Zach's ph...
Hey, give me the...

1885
01:23:41,282 --> 01:23:43,015
the cop in the ambulance,
give me his phone number.

1886
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,992
<i>Snipers, 45 seconds.</i>

1887
01:24:07,382 --> 01:24:09,079
- Hello?
- Cam?

1888
01:24:09,215 --> 01:24:10,746
Don't talk. Just listen.

1889
01:24:10,882 --> 01:24:12,680
This is Agent Clark, FBI.
I need you to get down

1890
01:24:12,816 --> 01:24:14,816
under the stretcher,
and do it now.

1891
01:24:16,321 --> 01:24:17,517
Snipers, 20 seconds.

1892
01:24:17,653 --> 01:24:19,722
I have eyes on the target.

1893
01:24:28,330 --> 01:24:31,338
Two-nine, negative.
We're still on the freeway.

1894
01:24:32,874 --> 01:24:34,506
Light brown car.

1895
01:24:35,674 --> 01:24:36,870
The snipers are gonna
take them out.

1896
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:38,106
You need to stay
as low as possible.

1897
01:24:38,241 --> 01:24:39,207
What?

1898
01:24:39,342 --> 01:24:40,710
We still green?

1899
01:24:40,845 --> 01:24:41,940
We're still green.
Green for go.

1900
01:24:42,076 --> 01:24:42,844
Take-take the shot
if you got it.

1901
01:24:44,354 --> 01:24:46,121
Target one, green.

1902
01:24:46,257 --> 01:24:48,053
Kill shots.
Nothing gets in the back.

1903
01:24:48,188 --> 01:24:49,382
We've got friendlies.

1904
01:24:49,517 --> 01:24:50,555
On my call.

1905
01:24:52,054 --> 01:24:55,021
Target two, red.
Target two not clear.

1906
01:24:57,193 --> 01:24:58,757
Wh-What about Zach?
I can't protect him. Can you?

1907
01:24:58,892 --> 01:25:00,134
What are you talking about?

1908
01:25:00,269 --> 01:25:02,098
- He's alive?
- Yes, he's alive.

1909
01:25:02,233 --> 01:25:03,136
Hey, he's alive.

1910
01:25:03,271 --> 01:25:04,398
- Our cop's alive.
- God!

1911
01:25:04,533 --> 01:25:06,302
- Three.
- No.

1912
01:25:06,438 --> 01:25:07,907
- Cam?
- No.

1913
01:25:08,042 --> 01:25:09,706
Two.

1914
01:25:15,416 --> 01:25:16,752
- Snipers! Snipers!
- What?

1915
01:25:16,887 --> 01:25:18,915
Where? Black building!

1916
01:25:19,051 --> 01:25:20,253
One.

1917
01:25:20,389 --> 01:25:22,958
Engage.

1918
01:25:23,094 --> 01:25:25,117
Oh, shit!

1919
01:25:35,435 --> 01:25:37,300
Go!

1920
01:25:37,435 --> 01:25:38,634
Ten-David, stand down.

1921
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:40,273
- Stand down.
- Fuck! The billboard!

1922
01:25:40,409 --> 01:25:41,467
<i>He knows what he's doing.</i>

1923
01:25:41,603 --> 01:25:43,307
<i>Must be a vet.</i>

1924
01:25:43,442 --> 01:25:45,143
I see what's happening now!

1925
01:25:45,278 --> 01:25:46,908
Oh, you want to play?

1926
01:25:56,491 --> 01:25:57,953
Now we just pissed them off.

1927
01:25:58,088 --> 01:25:59,356
- So, where are they going?
- Anywhere he wants.

1928
01:25:59,492 --> 01:26:00,955
She warned them.

1929
01:26:10,264 --> 01:26:12,637
All units, fall back.
I repeat, fall back.

1930
01:26:12,773 --> 01:26:14,804
And give me an assessment.
Anybody get hurt?

1931
01:26:17,007 --> 01:26:19,178
All right. You want to play?
Let's go.

1932
01:26:19,313 --> 01:26:20,645
<i>I only want two</i>

1933
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:22,016
<i>undercover cars on them,
500 feet.</i>

1934
01:26:22,152 --> 01:26:23,313
<i>These are smart L.A. boys.</i>

1935
01:26:23,449 --> 01:26:24,814
<i>Danny's studied FBI.</i>

1936
01:26:24,949 --> 01:26:26,482
<i>He's studied
LAPD pursuit tactics.</i>

1937
01:26:26,617 --> 01:26:28,214
<i>He knows it's all standard shit</i>

1938
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:30,824
But what he doesn't know,
super special agent,

1939
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,525
is I'm S.I.S.

1940
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:34,828
We set traps.
We let the bad guys come to us.

1941
01:26:34,963 --> 01:26:37,165
So you text Cam.

1942
01:26:37,301 --> 01:26:38,826
You make her an asset,
you hear me?

1943
01:26:38,962 --> 01:26:40,366
You find out
where they're going.

1944
01:26:40,502 --> 01:26:42,469
I'll set a trap
nobody gets out of.

1945
01:26:44,302 --> 01:26:45,498
Where's Monroe?

1946
01:26:45,633 --> 01:26:47,203
We got contact.

1947
01:26:47,338 --> 01:26:48,739
I'm here.

1948
01:26:48,874 --> 01:26:51,169
You're supposed to save
the hostages, right?

1949
01:26:51,305 --> 01:26:53,342
You're supposed to
keep them alive, right?

1950
01:26:53,478 --> 01:26:54,840
Or did I get that wrong?

1951
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:56,580
I want everyone alive, Danny.

1952
01:26:56,716 --> 01:26:58,853
So why the fuck
are you shooting at us?

1953
01:26:58,988 --> 01:27:00,018
That was a breach.

1954
01:27:00,154 --> 01:27:01,682
A what?

1955
01:27:01,817 --> 01:27:04,020
A mistake. Miscommunication.

1956
01:27:04,156 --> 01:27:07,352
Bullshit! You don't think
I'm gonna hurt anyone, do you?

1957
01:27:07,488 --> 01:27:09,862
That's not true.
I know what you're capable of.

1958
01:27:09,997 --> 01:27:12,895
Oh, yeah? Did Anson tell you
what my father would've done?

1959
01:27:14,203 --> 01:27:15,901
Why don't you tell me again?

1960
01:27:16,036 --> 01:27:18,274
He would've killed your cops
and the EMT back at the bank,

1961
01:27:18,409 --> 01:27:20,265
and then he would've had
a snack afterwards.

1962
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:22,210
Just take it easy,
all right, Danny?

1963
01:27:22,346 --> 01:27:23,710
Everybody knows
how dangerous you are.

1964
01:27:23,846 --> 01:27:25,205
Do you?

1965
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:27,073
Hey, you need to keep it cool
back there, man.

1966
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:28,911
You don't got to prove
a thing to me.

1967
01:27:31,850 --> 01:27:34,213
Danny? Did I lose you, buddy?

1968
01:27:35,253 --> 01:27:36,287
Take it.

1969
01:27:36,422 --> 01:27:38,223
- No.
- Take it.

1970
01:27:38,359 --> 01:27:40,424
- Why?
- Go on, take it.

1971
01:27:40,559 --> 01:27:42,430
Come on. Just click it open

1972
01:27:42,565 --> 01:27:44,899
and make sure
they can hear everything.

1973
01:27:45,035 --> 01:27:47,259
Tell him what I'm doing.

1974
01:27:49,034 --> 01:27:52,398
He's standing up,
and he has a gun in his hand.

1975
01:27:52,534 --> 01:27:55,073
Danny...

1976
01:27:55,208 --> 01:27:57,071
I saved you.

1977
01:27:57,206 --> 01:27:59,579
I saved both of you. Okay?

1978
01:27:59,714 --> 01:28:02,284
Why does everybody think
they are so special?

1979
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:04,415
I don't know
what's going on nowadays.

1980
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:05,811
You're just like the rest of us.

1981
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:07,449
You're just not important.

1982
01:28:07,584 --> 01:28:08,751
Yo, Danny, relax.

1983
01:28:08,887 --> 01:28:10,420
No, I'm not important,
but he is.

1984
01:28:10,556 --> 01:28:12,150
And I'm keeping him alive.

1985
01:28:12,286 --> 01:28:13,652
You need me, Danny.

1986
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:14,986
Careful, kid.

1987
01:28:15,122 --> 01:28:16,757
No, we don't need you anymore.

1988
01:28:16,892 --> 01:28:18,759
Danny, relax!

1989
01:28:18,894 --> 01:28:20,864
You're full of shit, Danny.

1990
01:28:21,567 --> 01:28:22,797
Am I?

1991
01:28:22,932 --> 01:28:24,764
Danny!

1992
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,138
- Will!
- Danny!

1993
01:28:30,605 --> 01:28:31,975
Will!

1994
01:28:32,110 --> 01:28:33,310
- Are you crazy right now?
- What are you doing?

1995
01:28:33,446 --> 01:28:34,783
What did she say? Will?

1996
01:28:34,918 --> 01:28:36,115
Was that a name?

1997
01:28:36,251 --> 01:28:37,512
What are you doing?

1998
01:28:37,648 --> 01:28:39,448
They need to know...

1999
01:28:42,421 --> 01:28:43,986
Motherfucker!

2000
01:28:53,434 --> 01:28:55,300
William Sharp.

2001
01:28:55,435 --> 01:28:56,833
He's Danny's brother.

2002
01:28:56,968 --> 01:28:58,468
You always got a fucking plan.

2003
01:28:58,604 --> 01:28:59,837
Stop the car!

2004
01:29:00,969 --> 01:29:02,334
Who's fighting? Can we see?

2005
01:29:03,772 --> 01:29:05,308
You fucking stop!

2006
01:29:05,443 --> 01:29:07,013
God!

2007
01:29:09,515 --> 01:29:11,783
That hurt!

2008
01:29:13,349 --> 01:29:15,182
Hey! All right, all right,
all right, all right,

2009
01:29:15,317 --> 01:29:16,822
all right, all right,
all right, all right...

2010
01:29:16,957 --> 01:29:17,816
- Do it again. Do it again!
- All right, all right...

2011
01:29:17,951 --> 01:29:19,553
Easy, easy. Easy.

2012
01:29:21,188 --> 01:29:22,693
- You're crazy.
- Say it! Say it!

2013
01:29:22,829 --> 01:29:25,324
- Look! I have a plan!
- Shut up!

2014
01:29:25,459 --> 01:29:26,660
Papi's guys are
setting a diversion

2015
01:29:26,796 --> 01:29:28,395
for us at Boyle Heights.

2016
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:29,665
She says they're going
to Boyle Heights intersection.

2017
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:30,666
Boyle Heights intersection.

2018
01:29:30,801 --> 01:29:32,232
He's gonna try to lose us there.

2019
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:34,409
Shit, the FBI. Let go.

2020
01:29:34,545 --> 01:29:36,910
It's Anson, FBI.
Danny, you there?

2021
01:29:37,045 --> 01:29:38,679
Danny?

2022
01:29:38,815 --> 01:29:41,543
No, we just got a change
in the pitching rotation.

2023
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:43,078
Hi, Will.

2024
01:29:43,214 --> 01:29:45,747
You boys having a little
squabble in there, huh?

2025
01:29:45,882 --> 01:29:47,379
What's your plan here, man?

2026
01:29:47,514 --> 01:29:49,554
Guess you're in charge now,
little brother.

2027
01:29:49,689 --> 01:29:51,019
Bad guys can't hear me.

2028
01:29:51,155 --> 01:29:52,217
Our fixed-wing has
high-altitude eyes.

2029
01:29:52,352 --> 01:29:54,025
Make it look like
we disappeared.

2030
01:29:54,161 --> 01:29:56,093
<i>Air 11 to every team.
We're pulling off.</i>

2031
01:29:56,229 --> 01:29:58,191
You know, it seems to me like
we're the only ones trying

2032
01:29:58,327 --> 01:29:59,764
to keep these people alive,
Special Agent.

2033
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,860
Oh, yeah? How you figure?

2034
01:30:01,996 --> 01:30:03,430
Just give us some space.

2035
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:04,930
I thought you were supposed
to be the smart one, no?

2036
01:30:05,065 --> 01:30:06,775
Yeah, apparently not.

2037
01:30:06,910 --> 01:30:08,941
I've seen your file.
I mean, you joined the Marines

2038
01:30:09,077 --> 01:30:11,036
so you wouldn't have to end up
like dipshit brother Danny

2039
01:30:11,172 --> 01:30:12,380
or your psycho dad LT, right?

2040
01:30:12,516 --> 01:30:13,443
I mean, you're
a fucking war hero, man.

2041
01:30:13,579 --> 01:30:15,045
What are you doing?

2042
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:16,384
That was yesterday.
We're talking about today.

2043
01:30:16,519 --> 01:30:18,210
You take a hostage,
it's 30 years.

2044
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:19,552
Just shut the fuck up, Danny.

2045
01:30:19,688 --> 01:30:21,050
What are you,
his fucking lawyer?

2046
01:30:21,185 --> 01:30:22,315
I'm giving him
great legal advice.

2047
01:30:22,451 --> 01:30:23,424
Will, listen to me.
You got a family.

2048
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:24,491
You got your whole life
ahead of you.

2049
01:30:24,627 --> 01:30:25,525
You gonna tell him
it's 30 years?

2050
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:26,992
You take a hostage,
it's 30 years?

2051
01:30:27,128 --> 01:30:27,721
- You gonna tell him, Anson?
- It's time to call it quits.

2052
01:30:27,857 --> 01:30:28,926
Just pull over, man.

2053
01:30:29,061 --> 01:30:30,391
Fucking reading you
out of the playbook.

2054
01:30:30,527 --> 01:30:31,732
- Don't listen to him.
- You take a hostage,

2055
01:30:31,867 --> 01:30:33,324
- it's 30 years.
- Danny, this is between Will and I.

2056
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:35,661
- Will, focus.
- This guy.

2057
01:30:35,796 --> 01:30:37,005
Your wife... you want me
to call your wife right now?

2058
01:30:37,141 --> 01:30:38,399
Do not call my wife.

2059
01:30:38,534 --> 01:30:39,805
He's got your best interests,
my friend. That's it.

2060
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:41,399
There's only so much
I can do for you, Will.

2061
01:30:41,535 --> 01:30:42,776
- 30 years.
- You've got a family.

2062
01:30:42,912 --> 01:30:44,239
- Ask him what happens when you shoot a cop.
- Shut up!

2063
01:30:44,374 --> 01:30:46,139
Tate will only see his daddy
behind plexiglass.

2064
01:30:46,275 --> 01:30:47,640
What the fuck are you doing?

2065
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:49,143
The truth is he probably won't
even want to see you at all.

2066
01:30:49,279 --> 01:30:50,944
Okay, everybody...
everybody just shut up!

2067
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:52,447
Everybody just shut up, okay?

2068
01:30:52,582 --> 01:30:54,749
You're gonna dig your
own grave on this one, my man.

2069
01:30:54,884 --> 01:30:55,819
I can give you an out,

2070
01:30:55,955 --> 01:30:57,922
but I can only do that
right now.

2071
01:31:00,262 --> 01:31:01,758
We don't stop.

2072
01:31:01,893 --> 01:31:03,925
<i>That's my brother!</i>

2073
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:05,761
William Sharp is the weak link.

2074
01:31:05,896 --> 01:31:07,635
He is not gonna kill anyone.

2075
01:31:09,564 --> 01:31:12,805
Cam, you need to work Will.

2076
01:31:16,647 --> 01:31:19,008
Rerouting to surface streets.

2077
01:31:19,144 --> 01:31:21,473
Don't lick your fingers
and touch my shit.

2078
01:31:23,786 --> 01:31:25,643
All units, Boyle Heights,
set perimeters.

2079
01:31:25,779 --> 01:31:27,488
Where is that? I don't usually
go east of Downtown.

2080
01:31:27,624 --> 01:31:29,355
You realize
four million Angelenos

2081
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:30,956
live east of Downtown?

2082
01:31:31,091 --> 01:31:33,127
Sorry. My husband is
an environmental attorney.

2083
01:31:33,263 --> 01:31:34,662
Okay? We like the beach.

2084
01:31:34,798 --> 01:31:36,188
That's, like, the whitest
thing I've ever heard.

2085
01:31:36,323 --> 01:31:37,864
Well, I'm white.
I can't help it.

2086
01:31:37,999 --> 01:31:40,096
Save it for Oprah, buddy.
We got shit going on.

2087
01:31:41,662 --> 01:31:43,972
You get any of that freaking
Cheeto dust in my hair,

2088
01:31:44,107 --> 01:31:45,464
I swear...

2089
01:31:45,599 --> 01:31:47,741
Please. You could lose
a raccoon in there.

2090
01:31:48,777 --> 01:31:50,372
Easy on the blood bank, Cam.

2091
01:31:50,508 --> 01:31:52,971
- Will needs some of it, too.
- Okay.

2092
01:31:53,107 --> 01:31:54,974
It's fine. Just take it.

2093
01:31:55,109 --> 01:31:56,710
So you were a Marine?

2094
01:31:56,845 --> 01:31:58,510
Until today.

2095
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:04,553
It's my wife.

2096
01:32:04,688 --> 01:32:05,852
Hey, babe.

2097
01:32:05,988 --> 01:32:07,521
Will, where are you?

2098
01:32:09,161 --> 01:32:11,897
Yeah, the interview
went long, and, uh...

2099
01:32:12,032 --> 01:32:15,234
and they needed somebody
to start today, so...

2100
01:32:15,369 --> 01:32:16,571
You got the job?

2101
01:32:16,707 --> 01:32:19,841
Yeah, I got... I got the job.

2102
01:32:21,137 --> 01:32:22,571
He got the job.

2103
01:32:22,706 --> 01:32:24,068
He got the job.

2104
01:32:24,204 --> 01:32:25,675
Oh, we'll celebrate.

2105
01:32:25,811 --> 01:32:27,174
Wait, are you driving now?

2106
01:32:27,310 --> 01:32:29,377
Yeah, there's a lot of traffic.

2107
01:32:29,512 --> 01:32:32,186
Yeah, some car chase
bank robbery thing on the news.

2108
01:32:32,321 --> 01:32:33,754
Only in L.A., huh?

2109
01:32:33,889 --> 01:32:35,690
Yeah, you know,
they probably don't want me

2110
01:32:35,825 --> 01:32:38,688
to be on the phone
on my first day, so...

2111
01:32:38,824 --> 01:32:40,486
call you back, all right?

2112
01:32:41,493 --> 01:32:43,526
Will?

2113
01:32:43,661 --> 01:32:44,891
Yeah, baby?

2114
01:32:45,027 --> 01:32:46,833
I'm so proud of you.

2115
01:32:48,001 --> 01:32:50,034
Not just for taking care
of everything

2116
01:32:50,169 --> 01:32:52,535
with the insurance
and the money, but...

2117
01:32:52,670 --> 01:32:54,368
for being a man.

2118
01:32:55,376 --> 01:32:57,008
Aw, babe.

2119
01:32:58,041 --> 01:33:00,506
One our son will look up to.

2120
01:33:02,352 --> 01:33:04,377
- Can I see him?
- Yeah.

2121
01:33:04,512 --> 01:33:06,444
Hey, vampire princess,
are you done?

2122
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:08,281
Are you done sucking
the life out

2123
01:33:08,417 --> 01:33:10,384
of every person
in this ambulance?!

2124
01:33:13,387 --> 01:33:15,387
Hey, what's up, big guy?

2125
01:33:15,523 --> 01:33:18,194
Just waking up?
You're so beautiful.

2126
01:33:19,368 --> 01:33:21,263
So beautiful.

2127
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:24,200
I love you.

2128
01:33:32,379 --> 01:33:34,139
Surgery?

2129
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:36,747
Yeah. Cancer's expensive.

2130
01:33:36,883 --> 01:33:38,414
You know what's gonna happen?

2131
01:33:38,549 --> 01:33:40,118
You're gonna get all his blood,
and then we're gonna die

2132
01:33:40,253 --> 01:33:41,981
in some perfectly preventable
traffic accident.

2133
01:33:42,117 --> 01:33:43,481
Fan-fucking-tastic!

2134
01:33:43,617 --> 01:33:44,789
That's why you're
robbing the banks.

2135
01:33:44,924 --> 01:33:46,420
Yeah, that and everything else.

2136
01:33:46,555 --> 01:33:48,154
I'm not blaming nobody.
I'm here because of me.

2137
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:50,260
You're not blaming your brother?

2138
01:33:50,395 --> 01:33:51,931
I think you need to be
a little more careful, Cam.

2139
01:33:52,066 --> 01:33:53,932
That's my brother
you're talking about.

2140
01:33:54,068 --> 01:33:55,604
I know it's your brother
I'm talking about,

2141
01:33:55,739 --> 01:33:57,603
but he's putting
people's lives at risk.

2142
01:33:57,739 --> 01:33:59,466
- Let me help you, Will.
- Stop.

2143
01:34:02,236 --> 01:34:04,604
What you talking about?

2144
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:07,078
Nothing. It's okay.
I-I have everything I need.

2145
01:34:14,248 --> 01:34:16,114
Castro? Castro?

2146
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:17,459
You tuck way under?

2147
01:34:17,594 --> 01:34:19,287
Danny, listen. Um...

2148
01:34:19,423 --> 01:34:21,658
what the hell is going on
right now, man?

2149
01:34:21,794 --> 01:34:23,160
Is this shit legal?

2150
01:34:23,295 --> 01:34:24,966
You cannot be arrested
for possession of paint.

2151
01:34:25,102 --> 01:34:26,635
Yeah, I understand
that, but th-these guys are

2152
01:34:26,770 --> 01:34:27,699
giving me
<i>Grand Theft Auto</i> vibes,

2153
01:34:27,835 --> 01:34:29,199
man, and it's throwing me off.

2154
01:34:29,334 --> 01:34:31,137
I don't know,
the explosives, th-the guns.

2155
01:34:31,273 --> 01:34:32,972
These guys look like they do
this type of shit all the time.

2156
01:34:33,108 --> 01:34:34,706
Man, I just...
I just really want to go home.

2157
01:34:34,842 --> 01:34:36,139
I really want to go home, man.

2158
01:34:36,275 --> 01:34:37,535
You're not going
anywhere, Castro.

2159
01:34:37,671 --> 01:34:38,678
- You stay right there.
- Is that Danny?

2160
01:34:38,813 --> 01:34:40,312
- Um, uh...
- Just say yes.

2161
01:34:40,447 --> 01:34:41,717
Yeah.

2162
01:34:41,852 --> 01:34:43,785
Give him the phone.

2163
01:34:45,613 --> 01:34:48,153
Hey, we're all set up.
You close?

2164
01:34:48,288 --> 01:34:50,490
- Yeah. Five minutes.
- All right, good. The money?

2165
01:34:50,625 --> 01:34:52,156
I'm a man of my word.

2166
01:34:52,291 --> 01:34:53,860
Good. Papi's gonna be glad
to hear that.

2167
01:34:53,996 --> 01:34:56,492
We're tapping
his AirPods right now.

2168
01:34:56,628 --> 01:34:59,363
These guys are nutjobs.
What's going on in there?

2169
01:34:59,498 --> 01:35:01,159
Whew! I got to
chill out. I got to chill out.

01:36:00,422 --> 01:36:02,286
<i>or can we get to a hospital?</i>

2191
01:36:02,422 --> 01:36:04,064
Why the L.A. River?

2192
01:36:04,199 --> 01:36:07,559
It's 40 miles of empty concrete
in either direction.

2193
01:36:07,694 --> 01:36:09,068
Might be trying to lose us

2194
01:36:09,204 --> 01:36:11,037
in the tunnels that go
under the street or...

2195
01:36:13,103 --> 01:36:15,602
Pull over. Pull over.

2196
01:36:18,942 --> 01:36:20,914
We can see him,

2197
01:36:21,049 --> 01:36:22,774
but we can't hide
from him, either.

2198
01:36:22,909 --> 01:36:25,084
He's watching us,
trying to draw me in.

2199
01:36:25,219 --> 01:36:28,054
Fixed-wing aircraft,
zoom in, please.

2200
01:36:32,789 --> 01:36:35,292
<i>Cessna,
bogey stepping out of vehicle.</i>

2201
01:36:38,096 --> 01:36:39,800
Dial that sat phone of his.

2202
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:42,761
Air 11, I want you to be
real aggressive.

2203
01:36:42,896 --> 01:36:45,236
Drop down and buzz him.
Chase him out of there.

2204
01:36:50,073 --> 01:36:51,242
I see you, Danny.

2205
01:36:52,242 --> 01:36:53,981
We're coming by to say hi.

2206
01:36:54,116 --> 01:36:55,477
- You sure you want to do that?
- Incoming!

2207
01:37:08,663 --> 01:37:10,096
Drive. Drive.

2208
01:37:11,426 --> 01:37:13,132
Where's my bag? I need mags.

2209
01:37:18,266 --> 01:37:19,303
We're in pursuit.

2210
01:37:26,783 --> 01:37:28,316
They got two on us.

2211
01:37:39,828 --> 01:37:40,858
<i>Gun, gun, gun.</i>

2212
01:37:40,994 --> 01:37:42,360
<i>Move!</i>

2213
01:37:42,495 --> 01:37:44,130
He's coming back.
Caution. Watch out.

2214
01:37:45,826 --> 01:37:48,200
Will you just stay
out of the water?!

2215
01:37:48,335 --> 01:37:50,032
I'm driving through
the fucking L.A. River!

2216
01:37:50,168 --> 01:37:51,696
There's water everywhere!

2217
01:37:51,832 --> 01:37:53,535
If the air team
can take him out, do it.

2218
01:38:21,338 --> 01:38:23,267
- We're hit. We just took fire.
- I think I got them.

2219
01:38:23,402 --> 01:38:24,538
How long
till I get fresh helos?

2220
01:38:24,673 --> 01:38:26,040
Yes! I did, I did.

2221
01:38:27,670 --> 01:38:29,401
Let's do the alley-oop
right now, okay?

2222
01:38:29,537 --> 01:38:30,911
All units, here he comes.

2223
01:38:31,046 --> 01:38:32,076
You press him.
You press him hard.

- The ambulance.

- Wh-Why?
- Wh... Just...

What?
Just spray the whole thing.

2250

The whole
motherfucking ambulance?

2251

- Yeah. Spray it.
- It's gonna be like five hours.

You have 45 seconds.

2253
01:40:02,762 --> 01:40:04,164
All right. Gonna be sloppy.

2254
01:40:18,018 --> 01:40:19,712
All right.

2255
01:40:19,848 --> 01:40:21,220
They thought
they were being tricky

2256
01:40:21,356 --> 01:40:22,716
going the wrong way
down that one-way.

But now they're cornered
three blocks away.

They think they shook us

2259
01:40:28,122 --> 01:40:30,692
and that our air support
is having mechanical issues.

2260
01:40:30,827 --> 01:40:32,997
Police Cessna is watching 'em
under a bridge.

2261

We're gonna let 'em relax.

2262
01:40:34,795 --> 01:40:36,202

01:40:41,173 --> 01:40:42,172
- Just walk.
- What?

2267
01:40:42,308 --> 01:40:43,969
It's your time. You can walk.

Neon green? I told you blue.

2273
01:40:59,690 --> 01:41:01,354
I said blue.
What is this, 1992?

2274
01:41:01,490 --> 01:41:02,729
Boss, this is all I got.

2275
01:41:02,865 --> 01:41:04,095
Are you in trouble?

2276
01:41:04,230 --> 01:41:05,592
No. It's just called stress.

2277
01:41:05,727 --> 01:41:07,360
It's called stress. That's all.

2278

You got 45 seconds.

2279

- Got him.

Get him out of here.

<i>then you pop up

2287
01:41:27,682 --> 01:41:29,623

2288
01:41:31,522 --> 01:41:33,392
This is the real deal.

2289
01:41:35,358 --> 01:41:36,896
It's fully loaded.

2290
01:41:37,032 --> 01:41:38,423
Yeah, all right. Let's go.

2291

2293
01:41:42,029 --> 01:41:44,064
- No idea.
- What's going on, Will?

2294
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:46,570
Five minutes, 45 seconds,
or whatever the fuck he said.

2295
01:41:46,705 --> 01:41:50,976
No, man, don't cover
the fucking window.

2296
01:41:51,111 --> 01:41:52,809
How am I gonna drive?

2297
01:41:52,945 --> 01:41:54,645
Better hustle before they find us here.

2298
01:41:54,780 --> 01:41:56,816
I hear one coming.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

2300
01:41:58,748 --> 01:41:59,952
I need you to take
this ambulance.

2301
01:42:00,088 --> 01:42:01,616
I need you to go that way.

2302
01:42:01,751 --> 01:42:03,088
- Okay? Here's 10K.
- Wait, what?

2303
01:42:03,223 --> 01:42:04,753
Anybody stops you, you tell them

2304
01:42:04,889 --> 01:42:06,822
that you don't know why
you are in an ambulance.

2305
01:42:06,957 --> 01:42:08,656
- Okay?
- Who's gonna... Who's gonna ask me that, man?

2306
01:42:08,792 --> 01:42:09,929
Nobody.
Nobody's gonna ask you that.

2307
01:42:10,065 --> 01:42:11,096
I don't think. All right?

2308
01:42:11,231 --> 01:42:12,261
- You don't think?
- Okay?

2309
01:42:12,397 --> 01:42:13,634
This motherfucker's crazy.

2310
01:42:18,399 --> 01:42:20,065
We're
locked down and ready to go.

2311

We got six cars leaving.

2312

Helos, split up.

2314

<i>He's going east. You go west.</i>

Yo, I don't even know
how I got here.

2324
01:43:36,046 --> 01:43:37,844
I wasn't feeling well.
I went to the doctors,

2325
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:39,882
and they told me
to go to the hospital.

2326
01:43:40,018 --> 01:43:41,521
I had the motherfucking
wine cooler with the medicine,

2327
01:43:41,656 --> 01:43:43,017
and I don't know...
I-I thought it was Kool-Aid.

They said I didn't have enough
medicine, then I had too much.

01:46:39,192 --> 01:46:41,392
Fuck off!

2346
01:46:52,011 --> 01:46:53,045
Oh, hold...
Whoa, whoa. Apparently...

2347
01:46:53,181 --> 01:46:54,211
What was that?

2348
01:46:54,346 --> 01:46:55,540
That's Roberto.

2349
01:46:55,676 --> 01:46:57,045
No.

2350
01:46:57,181 --> 01:46:58,385
We can't see
if he's moving or not.

2351
01:46:58,521 --> 01:46:59,783
It's-it's...
Rick, pull up. Zoom out.

2352
01:46:59,919 --> 01:47:01,281
We're gonna get off of it.

2353
01:47:01,416 --> 01:47:02,723
Well,
we hear it was a code four.

2354
01:47:04,924 --> 01:47:06,619
Apparently, the suspect is dead.

2355
01:47:15,262 --> 01:47:16,730
Blue-One to Control.

2356
01:47:16,866 --> 01:47:18,237
Give me a clear frequency.

2357
01:47:18,372 --> 01:47:19,936
All units, be advised.

2358
01:47:20,071 --> 01:47:22,306
This is Special Agent
Anson Clark, FBI.

2359
01:47:22,441 --> 01:47:24,439
Land immediately.

2360
01:47:41,564 --> 01:47:43,989
Yes, yes, yes, yes!
Hey, we made it.

2361
01:48:00,810 --> 01:48:03,341
Who are these guys?

2362
01:48:03,477 --> 01:48:05,613
Just relax.
They just saved our asses.

2363
01:48:05,749 --> 01:48:07,849
Who saves us from them?

2364
01:48:07,984 --> 01:48:09,649
You heard about Roberto?

2365
01:48:09,784 --> 01:48:11,317
He's dead.

2366
01:48:12,820 --> 01:48:14,925
Hey, is it true?

2367
01:48:16,430 --> 01:48:18,462
It's a sad day today.

2368
01:48:18,597 --> 01:48:20,964
Papi's in his office.

2369
01:48:22,136 --> 01:48:23,494
Will.

2370
01:48:25,966 --> 01:48:27,267
Casper.

2371
01:48:28,276 --> 01:48:29,434
Watch the cop.

2372
01:48:34,846 --> 01:48:37,981
No matter what, do not get out.

2373
01:48:52,632 --> 01:48:54,057
I know, Papi.

2374
01:48:54,193 --> 01:48:55,728
I'm sorry for your loss.

2375
01:48:55,864 --> 01:48:57,328
It's terrible.

2376
01:48:57,464 --> 01:48:59,706
Can't imagine
how you feel right now.

2377
01:48:59,842 --> 01:49:02,137
I think I have something
to ease your suffering.

2378
01:49:03,136 --> 01:49:04,810
Pay me my fucking money.

2379
01:49:08,651 --> 01:49:11,377
You think you're so tough
with that gun.

2380
01:49:13,983 --> 01:49:15,748
Eight million. It's yours.

2381
01:49:15,884 --> 01:49:18,082
Let me see it.

2382
01:49:18,217 --> 01:49:20,023
I'll handle our money.

2383
01:49:26,227 --> 01:49:28,031
Fuck.

2384
01:49:28,166 --> 01:49:29,862
Keep it down, keep it down,
keep it down.

2385
01:49:32,372 --> 01:49:34,004
It's a shitshow.

2386
01:49:35,072 --> 01:49:37,044
I don't think
they like cops here.

2387
01:49:37,179 --> 01:49:39,709
Was your...

2388
01:49:39,844 --> 01:49:42,342
Was your hand in my stomach?

2389
01:49:43,351 --> 01:49:44,685
Like, way in.

2390
01:49:46,847 --> 01:49:48,513
Okay.

2391
01:49:50,854 --> 01:49:52,386
It's all there, Papi.

2392
01:49:52,522 --> 01:49:54,724
Hard to put a price
on the life of a child, Danny.

2393
01:49:54,860 --> 01:49:57,027
Yeah, I know, Papi. I'm sorry.

2394
01:49:58,232 --> 01:49:59,566
Yeah.

2395
01:49:59,702 --> 01:50:01,959
I worked for your daddy
a long time.

2396
01:50:02,094 --> 01:50:03,937
Long time.

2397
01:50:04,906 --> 01:50:08,203
He never came close
to nothing like this.

2398
01:50:12,914 --> 01:50:17,083
Y-You think how proud
he'd be of you now.

2399
01:50:17,218 --> 01:50:18,786
Yeah.

2400
01:50:18,921 --> 01:50:20,481
<i>Zach's phone
is in the ambulance.</i>

2401
01:50:20,616 --> 01:50:22,582
- Triangulate it and find them.
- It's dead.

2402
01:50:22,718 --> 01:50:24,251
You hear all that?

2403
01:50:24,387 --> 01:50:27,119
They're getting hot
out there, Papi.

2404
01:50:29,890 --> 01:50:32,498
You two need to sit down
and relax for a couple hours.

2405
01:50:32,633 --> 01:50:34,625
We'll get the van ready for you.

2406
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:36,334
We can talk business
while we're waiting.

2407
01:50:36,469 --> 01:50:37,970
Nah. We're good.

2408
01:50:38,105 --> 01:50:39,839
Yeah, no, look.
And all due respect, Papi,

2409
01:50:39,974 --> 01:50:41,600
you don't need an MBA
to figure it out.

2410
01:50:41,735 --> 01:50:43,667
That's yours. We got ours.
Business is closed.

2411
01:50:43,802 --> 01:50:45,445
Uh, no, you're right.
You're right, Danny.

2412
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:47,114
You're right. It's not business.

2413
01:50:47,249 --> 01:50:49,449
It is personal.

2414
01:50:49,584 --> 01:50:51,112
My son died for this money.

2415
01:50:51,248 --> 01:50:53,114
Yeah, and that's
a hell of a lot more

2416
01:50:53,250 --> 01:50:54,513
than most people get
when they die.

2417
01:50:54,648 --> 01:50:56,357
Well, I guess
that makes him lucky, huh?

2418
01:50:56,492 --> 01:50:58,689
No. That's not what he's saying.

2419
01:50:58,824 --> 01:51:00,484
Just a straight split, Papi.

2420
01:51:00,620 --> 01:51:03,654
That's what
we talked about... 50-50.

2421
01:51:03,789 --> 01:51:06,767
Papi, there's a cop
in the van, huh?

2422
01:51:08,999 --> 01:51:11,101
We're hostages, you know?

2423
01:51:12,601 --> 01:51:15,702
Yeah, but one of them
is trying to help us.

2424
01:51:15,837 --> 01:51:18,043
Will.

2425
01:51:18,178 --> 01:51:20,605
You've got a lot of his blood
through you right now.

2426
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:25,346
Hey.

2427
01:51:26,355 --> 01:51:27,650
It's my partner's.

2428
01:51:27,786 --> 01:51:29,550
It was under my leg.

2429
01:51:29,686 --> 01:51:31,391
No.

2430
01:51:31,527 --> 01:51:33,393
There's too many of them.

2431
01:51:33,529 --> 01:51:35,326
They're going to kill us.

2432
01:51:35,461 --> 01:51:37,193
Yeah.

2433
01:51:38,962 --> 01:51:41,167
We're family, Danny.

2434
01:51:41,302 --> 01:51:43,035
50-50.

2435
01:51:43,170 --> 01:51:44,833
- Great. Let's go.
- Let's go. Get the van. We out.

2436
01:51:44,968 --> 01:51:46,067
Yeah. Let's go.

2437
01:51:46,202 --> 01:51:48,138
<i>Espérate, Danny.</i>

2438
01:51:53,710 --> 01:51:55,816
The cop.

2439
01:51:57,149 --> 01:51:58,984
We're gonna take him
off your hands.

2440
01:52:00,350 --> 01:52:02,349
- Wait, what?
- Yeah, all right.

2441
01:52:02,485 --> 01:52:04,182
You can have the cop.
We keep the EMT.

2442
01:52:04,318 --> 01:52:05,348
No deal. We want 'em both.

2443
01:52:05,484 --> 01:52:07,190
No, no, no, no.

2444
01:52:07,326 --> 01:52:09,028
You brought that woman
into my inner sanctum.

2445
01:52:09,164 --> 01:52:11,590
She laid eyes on all the shit
I got going on in here,

2446
01:52:11,725 --> 01:52:13,528
everything I do
for all these special people.

2447
01:52:13,663 --> 01:52:16,233
You brought her here,
regrettably, so now she stays.

2448
01:52:16,368 --> 01:52:18,235
No, she comes with us.
We take 'em both. Let's go.

2449
01:52:18,370 --> 01:52:20,070
- Now, that's dumber than a box of rocks.
- Yo.

2450
01:52:20,206 --> 01:52:21,434
I would've thought
your pretend father

2451
01:52:21,569 --> 01:52:22,905
schooled you better
than that, Will.

2452
01:52:23,041 --> 01:52:24,371
Yeah, he schooled me on a lot.

2453
01:52:24,507 --> 01:52:25,544
He schooled me on exactly
what not to do.

2454
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:27,244
And yet here you are!

2455
01:52:27,380 --> 01:52:29,408
- Yeah, here I am.
- Will, c-come on. Come on. Hey, look.

2456
01:52:29,544 --> 01:52:30,750
Listen to me.
Listen to me. Stop.

2457
01:52:30,885 --> 01:52:32,209
Stop it, Will.
What are you doing?

2458
01:52:32,344 --> 01:52:34,049
Stop. Stop it now.

2459
01:52:34,184 --> 01:52:35,585
You want to get killed for her?

2460
01:52:35,721 --> 01:52:37,121
She fucked us.

2461
01:52:37,256 --> 01:52:38,783
How do you think
the police knew how to block

2462
01:52:38,918 --> 01:52:40,290
- all those intersections?
- Because she told them.

2463
01:52:40,426 --> 01:52:41,962
What? What, they just all
appeared out of nowhere?

2464
01:52:42,097 --> 01:52:43,389
- No, because she told them, Danny.
- She fucked us.

2465
01:52:43,525 --> 01:52:45,065
She did what she was
supposed to do

2466
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:46,891
- with the bad guys, Danny. How do you...
- No, no, no.

2467
01:52:47,027 --> 01:52:48,802
No, we are not the bad guys!
It is not that simple, Will.

2468
01:52:48,938 --> 01:52:50,937
It is not that simple.
We're not the bad guys.

2469
01:52:51,072 --> 01:52:52,903
We're just the guys
trying to get home.

2470
01:52:57,278 --> 01:52:59,405
Danny, we've been trying
to get home for the whole day,

2471
01:52:59,541 --> 01:53:01,114
and you know
what we've been causing?

2472
01:53:01,249 --> 01:53:02,741
- A whole fucking wake behind us.
- Listen, listen...

2473
01:53:02,876 --> 01:53:04,579
There's a whole fucking wake
of bodies behind us

2474
01:53:04,715 --> 01:53:06,317
because we've been just trying to get home!

2475
01:53:06,453 --> 01:53:07,411
- We don't get home, Danny!
- Listen to me. Listen to me.

2476
01:53:07,546 --> 01:53:08,920
We are almost there. Just...

2477
01:53:09,056 --> 01:53:10,749
We've already lost, Danny.

2478
01:53:10,884 --> 01:53:12,787
What are you trying to do,
some fucking cowboy shit?

2479
01:53:12,923 --> 01:53:14,421
Stop. Stop it.

2480
01:53:14,557 --> 01:53:16,126
Just come. Let's go.
We get the money.

2481
01:53:16,262 --> 01:53:18,088
We get the money
for your family. Let's go.

2482
01:53:18,223 --> 01:53:19,457
Okay?

2483
01:53:19,592 --> 01:53:21,301
We're there. Do you understand?

2484
01:53:21,436 --> 01:53:22,929
We're there.

2485
01:53:23,065 --> 01:53:24,905
Let's go home.

2486
01:53:25,904 --> 01:53:27,100
I can't do it, Danny.

2487
01:53:27,236 --> 01:53:28,468
What's going on with you?

2488
01:53:28,603 --> 01:53:30,106
Honestly, what's going on
with you?

2489
01:53:30,242 --> 01:53:32,843
We run the town.
We're there, man.

2490
01:53:32,979 --> 01:53:35,106
Will. Will, brother, come on.

2491
01:53:35,241 --> 01:53:36,306
Look, look.

2492
01:53:36,442 --> 01:53:38,442
I'll give you all of it.

2493
01:53:38,578 --> 01:53:40,479
Okay? I'll give you all of it.

2494
01:53:40,615 --> 01:53:42,486
Danny, you know what
your problem is?

2495
01:53:42,621 --> 01:53:44,616
You think you can get away.

2496
01:53:44,751 --> 01:53:46,785
You hear those helicopters
out there?

2497
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:48,793
What happens next?
What's the plan next, Danny?

2498
01:53:48,928 --> 01:53:50,126
What's the next plan, Danny?

2499
01:53:50,262 --> 01:53:51,523
I've rolled with you
all this way.

2500
01:53:51,658 --> 01:53:53,132
- What's your next plan?
- We got to go.

2501
01:53:53,267 --> 01:53:54,793
- And what's the plan after that?
- We got to go.

2502
01:53:54,928 --> 01:53:56,133
- And what's the plan after that?
- Stop your talking.

2503
01:53:56,268 --> 01:53:57,663
- We got to go.
- No, it's over, Danny!

2504
01:53:57,799 --> 01:53:58,803
We don't get to walk off
into the sunset, Danny.

2505
01:53:58,938 --> 01:54:00,802
We fucked up! We fucked up!

2506
01:54:00,938 --> 01:54:02,809
We fucked up!

2507
01:54:02,945 --> 01:54:04,635
And I'm not fucking up again,
Danny.

2508
01:54:04,771 --> 01:54:06,310
I'm not leaving
nobody else behind.

2509
01:54:06,445 --> 01:54:08,478
Then I guess we've reached
the end of the road, huh?

2510
01:54:08,614 --> 01:54:09,679
Wow.

2511
01:54:09,814 --> 01:54:10,878
I'm sorry.

2512
01:54:11,014 --> 01:54:12,852
Yeah.

2513
01:54:12,988 --> 01:54:15,049
I'm sorry.
I'm just not like you.

2514
01:54:15,184 --> 01:54:16,816
That's it. We're done.

2515
01:54:16,952 --> 01:54:18,151
Go.

2516
01:54:18,287 --> 01:54:20,826
Yeah, you're not like me.

2517
01:54:20,961 --> 01:54:22,963
- You got that right.
- Yeah.

2518
01:54:24,532 --> 01:54:26,461
I'm not leaving.

2519
01:54:27,969 --> 01:54:30,162
We caused enough trouble
for today.

2520
01:54:30,298 --> 01:54:31,998
I'm not leaving 'em.

2521
01:54:33,839 --> 01:54:36,006
Strong choice.

2522
01:54:36,141 --> 01:54:38,675
<i>Carnales.</i>

2523
01:54:51,858 --> 01:54:53,385
What a fucking waste.

2524
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:54,693
Everybody just...

2525
01:54:54,829 --> 01:54:56,253
Everybody just calm down.

2526
01:54:56,388 --> 01:54:57,891
Just calm down.

2527
01:54:58,026 --> 01:54:59,494
Okay?

2528
01:55:00,497 --> 01:55:01,769
I'm sorry, brother.
I'm just...

2529
01:55:01,904 --> 01:55:03,266
I'm not like you.
I-I don't...

2530
01:55:03,401 --> 01:55:05,236
I'm not up
for these kind of heroics.

2531
01:55:06,404 --> 01:55:08,041
I'm sorry that
I brought you into this.

2532
01:55:08,176 --> 01:55:10,041
I just wanted things
to be the way they were,

2533
01:55:10,176 --> 01:55:11,939
the way they used to be,
you know?

2534
01:55:12,074 --> 01:55:15,411
But I guess so much has changed
that we're just different now.

2535
01:55:16,509 --> 01:55:18,584
It breaks my heart.

2536
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:21,415
Don't be sad, Danny.

2537
01:55:21,550 --> 01:55:23,590
Ain't like
he's your real brother.

2538
01:55:23,726 --> 01:55:25,588
We used to be so in sync.

2539
01:55:25,724 --> 01:55:28,424
And now you want to do this,
and I want to do that, you know?

2540
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:30,297
You want to go right,
and I want to go left.

2541
01:55:30,433 --> 01:55:33,128
And I wish we just both wanted
to go left together, you know?

2542
01:55:33,263 --> 01:55:35,062
We should just go left together.

2543
01:55:35,197 --> 01:55:36,797
Go left. Go left.

2544
01:55:56,456 --> 01:55:58,757
What'd you say,
that he's my pretend brother?

2545
01:55:58,892 --> 01:55:59,917
He's my real brother!

2546
01:56:06,402 --> 01:56:08,825
<i>Multiple
shots fired. Shots fired.</i>

2547
01:56:11,563 --> 01:56:13,634
Damn it!

01:56:24,618 --> 01:56:25,910
Cam!

2549

Cam!

No!

2551
01:56:40,294 --> 01:56:41,864
No.

2552
01:56:44,633 --> 01:56:46,837
- Who shot him?
- I don't know.

2553
01:56:46,972 --> 01:56:48,332
Just the shoulder?

2554
01:56:48,468 --> 01:56:50,638
You all right?

2555
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:22,802
Shit. Fuck.

2556
01:57:25,305 --> 01:57:27,180
Damn it!

2557
01:57:43,823 --> 01:57:45,197
Shoot at me, you fucker?

2558
01:57:45,333 --> 01:57:47,398
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Don't shoot at me!

2559
01:57:49,167 --> 01:57:50,693
Shoot me, motherfucker?

2560
01:57:50,829 --> 01:57:52,062
Get out of my fucking car!

2561
01:57:59,375 --> 01:58:00,706
Cam, you save his life!

2562
01:58:00,842 --> 01:58:02,248
You saved that cop.
You save him.

2563
01:58:03,418 --> 01:58:05,410
- Almost there.
- Cam, Cam, is he okay?

2564
01:58:05,545 --> 01:58:06,920
Just get us there.

2565
01:58:07,055 --> 01:58:09,046
I love my brother. You hear me?

2566
01:58:14,262 --> 01:58:16,796
Okay, Will. Just hold on.

2567
01:58:16,932 --> 01:58:18,891
Will, stop moving, please.

2568
01:58:21,234 --> 01:58:23,801
Will. Will, just stop moving.

2569
01:58:28,374 --> 01:58:30,441
Will, please stop moving,
please.

2570
01:58:31,541 --> 01:58:33,405
Give this to my wife, please.

2571
01:58:33,541 --> 01:58:35,545
My wife needs this.

2572
01:58:41,752 --> 01:58:44,554
Okay, I got you.
Now let me do my job. Come on.

2573
01:58:48,294 --> 01:58:49,590
Got their asses now.

2574
01:58:49,725 --> 01:58:51,955
Stay with me, Will.
Will, come on.

2575
01:58:52,090 --> 01:58:54,234
God fucking damn.

2576
01:58:55,135 --> 01:58:56,929
Shit.

2577
01:58:58,236 --> 01:58:59,466
Hey, pull them back.

2578
01:58:59,601 --> 01:59:01,468
They're not gonna listen to you.

2579
01:59:01,603 --> 01:59:02,501
They've just lost their friends.

2580
01:59:02,637 --> 01:59:04,843
Danny, we have a code red.

2581
01:59:04,979 --> 01:59:06,846
He's fa... He's fading.

Will. One, two, three.

2583
01:59:09,948 --> 01:59:11,782
Fuck!

2584
01:59:11,917 --> 01:59:13,810
Okay.

2585
01:59:13,945 --> 01:59:15,486
Okay, you're gonna stay with me.

2586
01:59:15,621 --> 01:59:17,280
We're gonna do this
for your kid. Okay.

2587
01:59:17,416 --> 01:59:19,791
Will, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

Will, come on.

01:59:21,588 --> 01:59:23,289
Come on. Come on.

2590
01:59:27,593 --> 01:59:28,526
Four. Five.

2591
01:59:41,343 --> 01:59:42,513
That way!

2592
01:59:45,786 --> 01:59:47,287
Triage!

2593
01:59:51,157 --> 01:59:52,358
Cam, we... Oh, shit.

2594
02:00:11,539 --> 02:00:14,343
Two, three, four.

2595
02:00:14,479 --> 02:00:16,878
One, two... It's not working.

2596
02:00:17,014 --> 02:00:18,844
- How-how is he?
- He's fading. I need to shock him.

2597
02:00:18,979 --> 02:00:20,418
Shit! No, this isn't happening.

2598
02:00:20,554 --> 02:00:22,181
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, Will.

2599
02:00:22,316 --> 02:00:24,489
His heart is slowing down.
His heart is slowing down.

2600
02:00:54,721 --> 02:00:56,580
Let's go. Let's go.
Take me down there now.

2601
02:00:58,853 --> 02:01:00,390
- Come on. What?
- Think.

2602
02:01:00,525 --> 02:01:01,889
- Is he okay?
- I'm trying.

2603
02:01:02,024 --> 02:01:03,891
I'm trying everything I can.
Come on, Will.

2604
02:01:04,026 --> 02:01:05,895
Please stay with me.
Please stay with me.

2605
02:01:06,031 --> 02:01:07,760
- Just stay where you are.
- No, you can't, not right now.

2606
02:01:07,896 --> 02:01:08,969
- Back up.
- What's happening?

2607
02:01:11,106 --> 02:01:12,805
Sierra-One to Sierra-Three.

2608
02:01:12,940 --> 02:01:14,236
You have a shot?

2609
02:01:14,371 --> 02:01:16,906
Sierra-Three set.

2610
02:01:17,042 --> 02:01:18,569
Eyes on.

2611
02:01:21,883 --> 02:01:23,744
Lieutenant Dyle.

2612
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:25,149
Sierra-One.
The windows are murky.

2613
02:01:25,284 --> 02:01:26,643
We don't have a shot.

2614
02:01:26,778 --> 02:01:28,419
Repeat, no shot.

2615
02:01:28,555 --> 02:01:29,780
I know this man.
I can talk him down.

2616
02:01:29,915 --> 02:01:30,981
You give me some time.

2617
02:01:31,117 --> 02:01:32,154
Sierra-One. Stand by.

2618
02:01:32,290 --> 02:01:34,256
Give me that.

2619
02:01:34,391 --> 02:01:35,756
Danny, it's Anson.

2620
02:01:35,891 --> 02:01:37,089
- Come on, Will.
- W-W-Wait.

2621
02:01:37,225 --> 02:01:38,429
- It's over, Danny.
- I have to think.

2622
02:01:38,564 --> 02:01:39,660
I-I got to think.
I got to think.

2623
02:01:39,795 --> 02:01:41,293
I don't know what to do.

2624
02:01:41,428 --> 02:01:42,663
This is your last
chance, man, so talk to me.

2625
02:01:42,799 --> 02:01:44,470
- What is that?
- Danny.

2626
02:01:47,637 --> 02:01:50,234
What is this? What is this?

2627
02:01:52,447 --> 02:01:54,111
This is a cop's gun.
This is a Glock.

2628
02:01:54,246 --> 02:01:55,609
Is this your gun?

2629
02:01:55,744 --> 02:01:57,483
Where'd this gun come from?

2630
02:01:58,745 --> 02:02:00,420
You shoot him?

2631
02:02:01,787 --> 02:02:04,455
- You shot him! You shot him.
- No.

2632
02:02:04,590 --> 02:02:05,787
- Danny, I did.
- You're lying.

2633
02:02:05,923 --> 02:02:07,517
I did. I didn't know
that it was Will.

2634
02:02:07,653 --> 02:02:08,952
- I just opened the door, and I just didn't know...
- What?

2635
02:02:09,087 --> 02:02:10,296
And I'm so sorry. I'm so...

2636
02:02:10,432 --> 02:02:11,794
- You shot him?
- Danny, it was me.

2637
02:02:11,929 --> 02:02:14,298
- You sh... Bullshit.
- Danny, I did. I did.

2638
02:02:14,434 --> 02:02:16,000
- Bullshit.
- I'm sorry.

2639
02:02:16,135 --> 02:02:17,299
I'm sorry. I...

2640
02:02:17,435 --> 02:02:18,805
You should be dead.

2641
02:02:18,940 --> 02:02:20,368
I'm sorry.

2642
02:02:20,504 --> 02:02:23,306
This cop should be dead!

2643
02:02:23,442 --> 02:02:25,709
He was trying to save you!

2644
02:02:29,684 --> 02:02:31,682
That's you on a stretcher.

2645
02:02:31,817 --> 02:02:34,454
What's happening in there?

2646
02:02:36,658 --> 02:02:38,151
- Danny? This is it.
- It's okay.

2647
02:02:38,286 --> 02:02:39,686
Danny, they're gonna blow
your fucking head off

2648
02:02:39,821 --> 02:02:41,159
if you don't come out right now.

2649
02:02:41,295 --> 02:02:43,122
We're gonna go outside...

2650
02:02:44,523 --> 02:02:47,467
...and I'm gonna shoot you
in the head on live TV.

2651
02:02:48,629 --> 02:02:50,902
Okay? Okay.

2652
02:02:51,037 --> 02:02:52,628
Okay?

2653
02:02:53,631 --> 02:02:56,337
We're gonna die together.

2654
02:02:56,472 --> 02:02:58,168
You ready?

2655
02:02:58,304 --> 02:03:00,545
Let's go. Let's go.

2656
02:03:00,681 --> 02:03:02,378
Sierra-One.
Get ready to breach.

2657
02:03:02,513 --> 02:03:04,015
You stand down.

2658
02:03:04,150 --> 02:03:05,679
Stand down!

2659
02:03:05,815 --> 02:03:08,013
You hold. Hold. Wait for my...

2660
02:03:08,149 --> 02:03:09,688
Danny, I can't hold
these guys off.

2661
02:03:09,823 --> 02:03:11,188
I don't know what the fuck
you want me to do here.

2662
02:03:11,323 --> 02:03:12,588
Don't do anything.

2663
02:03:12,723 --> 02:03:14,086
Keep your hands where they are.

2664
02:03:14,222 --> 02:03:16,025
Okay? Just keep your hands
where they are.

2665
02:03:16,161 --> 02:03:18,021
Danny, these guys are
gonna shoot you if you don't...

2666
02:03:18,156 --> 02:03:19,395
It's your last chance, man.

2667
02:03:19,531 --> 02:03:20,727
Sierra-One.

2668
02:03:20,863 --> 02:03:22,366
I've got movement at the door.

2669
02:03:22,501 --> 02:03:24,036
He looks agitated. Stand by.

2670
02:03:24,172 --> 02:03:25,505
I may have the shot.

2671
02:03:26,704 --> 02:03:28,906
I'm opening the door!

2672
02:03:29,042 --> 02:03:30,606
- You tell everyone to back up!
- Stand down, Dyle.

2673
02:03:30,741 --> 02:03:32,069
- Do not shoot.
- Back up!

2674
02:03:32,204 --> 02:03:33,545
Talk to me, Danny.

2675
02:03:33,681 --> 02:03:35,079
Wh-Where's your brother?
Where's Will, huh?

2676
02:03:35,214 --> 02:03:36,612
He's dead!

2677
02:03:36,747 --> 02:03:37,876
Danny, this is it.

2678
02:03:38,012 --> 02:03:39,275
I've got nothing else for you.

2679
02:03:39,411 --> 02:03:40,943
You've got to come out
right now.

2680
02:03:41,079 --> 02:03:42,952
Get those guys back!

2681
02:03:43,087 --> 02:03:44,948
You're gonna pull
your men back, or I'm gonna

2682
02:03:45,083 --> 02:03:46,382
shoot her in the head.

2683
02:03:46,518 --> 02:03:47,891
There's nothing more
I can do for you.

2684
02:03:48,026 --> 02:03:51,089
- Shoot him!
- You think I'm stupid, Anson?

2685
02:03:51,225 --> 02:03:52,929
No, I...
I don't think you're stupid.

2686
02:03:53,064 --> 02:03:54,565
- Just come...
- You're gonna pull your men back,

2687
02:03:54,701 --> 02:03:56,866
or I'm gonna shoot her
in the head.

2688
02:03:58,201 --> 02:04:01,098
They're not moving back,
and those choppers are up there!

2689
02:04:01,233 --> 02:04:03,570
You fucking come out right now.

2690
02:04:03,706 --> 02:04:05,942
I'm done!

2691
02:04:06,078 --> 02:04:08,073
- Shoot him. Shoot him!
- Oh, I'm done, motherfucker!

2692
02:04:08,209 --> 02:04:09,446
Sierra-One.
He's cracking the door.

2693
02:04:09,582 --> 02:04:11,746
I-I may have a shot. Stand by.

2694
02:04:11,882 --> 02:04:13,749
Anson, you were right.

2695
02:04:13,885 --> 02:04:16,083
My brother didn't do
anything wrong!

2696
02:04:18,555 --> 02:04:20,560
He was a good man!

2697
02:04:26,631 --> 02:04:28,264
Just shoot him!

2698
02:04:28,399 --> 02:04:29,932
But I'm not!

2699
02:05:06,469 --> 02:05:08,803
- No!
- Come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

2700
02:05:08,939 --> 02:05:10,933
No!

2701
02:05:11,936 --> 02:05:14,204
Got to clear a path
for transport to get in here.

2702
02:05:17,777 --> 02:05:19,810
Will...

2703
02:05:19,945 --> 02:05:22,446
Will, I'm sorry.

2704
02:05:23,683 --> 02:05:25,217
- It's okay.
- You really helped us out with the phone.

2705
02:05:25,352 --> 02:05:26,988
- I'm fine.
- You helped us out a lot.

2706
02:05:27,124 --> 02:05:28,551
Come on.
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

2707
02:05:28,686 --> 02:05:30,496
What happened? Huh?
Tell me what happened.

2708
02:05:30,631 --> 02:05:32,632
I don't know. Uh...

2709
02:05:33,834 --> 02:05:36,326
Danny said he was gonna
kill me, and-and...

2710
02:05:36,461 --> 02:05:38,337
Will...
Will must have heard him.

2711
02:05:38,473 --> 02:05:40,003
They need to get him in there.

2712
02:05:40,138 --> 02:05:42,675
Cam, Cam, Cam, Cam,
he's not your friend, okay?

2713
02:05:42,811 --> 02:05:44,343
He never was.
He's not your responsibility.

2714
02:05:44,478 --> 02:05:45,810
He's a criminal, all right?

2715
02:05:48,975 --> 02:05:50,980
Danny!

2716
02:06:58,912 --> 02:07:00,753
Excuse me.

2717
02:07:36,616 --> 02:07:38,182
<i>The situation is now over with.</i>

2718
02:07:38,317 --> 02:07:39,990
<i>Uh, uh, suspects on the ground.</i>

2719
02:07:40,125 --> 02:07:42,325
<i>The heroic EMT
was safely extracted.</i>

2720
02:07:42,460 --> 02:07:44,191
Will!

2721
02:07:44,326 --> 02:07:45,825
- Somebody help him!
- Ma'am.

2722
02:07:45,960 --> 02:07:47,299
Will!

2723
02:07:47,435 --> 02:07:49,001
- Will!
- Come on.

2724
02:07:49,137 --> 02:07:50,962
- Don't let him die, please!
- Behind the tape, please.

2725
02:07:51,097 --> 02:07:52,630
Don't let him die.

2726
02:07:52,766 --> 02:07:53,869
- Will!
- Ma'am, please. The police did all we could.

2727
02:07:54,004 --> 02:07:55,164
- Will!
- Ma'am, calm down.

2728
02:07:55,300 --> 02:07:57,544
Somebody help him! Will!

2729
02:07:57,679 --> 02:08:00,011
Please,
somebody help my husband.

2730
02:08:00,147 --> 02:08:02,140
- You need to forget him.
- Please. Please.

2731
02:08:02,275 --> 02:08:04,482
No. I didn't finish the job.

2732
02:08:04,618 --> 02:08:05,715
He's gonna die!

2733
02:08:05,850 --> 02:08:06,978
We need you to calm down, ma'am.

2734
02:08:07,114 --> 02:08:08,487
He's my husband. Please.

2735
02:08:08,622 --> 02:08:09,820
Please.

2736
02:08:09,956 --> 02:08:10,981
Hey, stop!
This is a crime scene.

2737
02:08:11,117 --> 02:08:12,489
Get off of me!

2738
02:08:12,624 --> 02:08:14,017
Back up! Back up!

2739
02:08:16,796 --> 02:08:18,189
Will. Come on, Will.

2740
02:08:18,325 --> 02:08:19,861
Good. Come on.

2741
02:08:19,996 --> 02:08:21,326
Hey. Look at me. Look at me.

2742
02:08:21,462 --> 02:08:23,028
Your wife is right here.
You can do this.

2743
02:08:23,163 --> 02:08:24,463
You can do this, Will.

2744
02:08:26,631 --> 02:08:28,505
Come on, Will.
Will, you got this.

2745
02:08:28,641 --> 02:08:29,899
What is wrong with you?

2746
02:08:30,035 --> 02:08:31,344
My God.

2747
02:08:31,479 --> 02:08:33,503
We'll get to him soon.

2748
02:08:33,639 --> 02:08:36,181
He'll be dead soon.
Help me now.

2749
02:08:36,316 --> 02:08:37,582
What?

2750
02:08:37,718 --> 02:08:40,585
He saved your partner's life.

2751
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:42,684
Come on, Will. You got this.

2752
02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:44,421
Come on, Will.

2753
02:08:44,557 --> 02:08:46,853
Come on. Move.

2754
02:08:46,989 --> 02:08:48,851
Come on. Come on, Will.

2755
02:08:48,986 --> 02:08:51,395
Come on, let's get him...
Come on, let's get him up.

2756
02:08:51,530 --> 02:08:53,056
Let's go.

2757
02:08:54,665 --> 02:08:56,061
Make a hole!

2758
02:08:56,197 --> 02:08:58,365
Make a hole. Make a hole.

2759
02:08:59,399 --> 02:09:01,236
You got this. Hey, hey.

2760
02:09:04,206 --> 02:09:05,845
Come on. You're almost there.

2761
02:09:06,844 --> 02:09:08,538
Tell my wife I'm sorry.

2762
02:09:08,674 --> 02:09:10,374
- I'm sorry.
- You tell her yourself.

2763
02:09:10,509 --> 02:09:12,046
Here you go.

2764
02:09:12,181 --> 02:09:13,714
- His name is Will.
- Yep.

2765
02:09:29,196 --> 02:09:30,731
Is he gonna make it?

2766
02:09:30,867 --> 02:09:33,129
I don't know.

2767
02:09:33,264 --> 02:09:35,039
I hope so.

2768
02:09:36,736 --> 02:09:39,271
I saw you on TV.
You're the one they took.

2769
02:09:39,406 --> 02:09:41,540
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

2770
02:09:42,548 --> 02:09:44,048
He saved me.

2771
02:09:45,045 --> 02:09:46,545
He saved me.

2772
02:09:48,116 --> 02:09:49,955
Try to forgive him.

2773
02:09:51,259 --> 02:09:53,222
For him.

2774
02:09:54,257 --> 02:09:56,086
Hi, cutie. Hi.

2775
02:09:56,221 --> 02:09:57,923
Hello. Hi.

2776
02:09:58,058 --> 02:09:59,496
Hi, baby.

2777
02:09:59,631 --> 02:10:01,333
Hi, cutie.

2778
02:10:21,982 --> 02:10:23,355
Hey.

2779
02:10:23,490 --> 02:10:24,957
You okay?

2780
02:11:27,688 --> 02:11:29,681
Ma'am, you can't...

2781
02:11:38,565 --> 02:11:40,032
It's okay.

2782
02:11:47,168 --> 02:11:48,832
Who shot you?

2783
02:12:28,539 --> 02:12:30,544
He saved my life.

2784
02:12:34,885 --> 02:12:37,056
I'm sorry.

2785
02:13:23,330 --> 02:13:25,269
Don't let go.
