I was running and all that shit.

602

Man, my stepdad had to shoot the
motherfucker off me, like, straight up.

Let me get that number.

606
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,960

That's like a ten.

607
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,040
[SEAN]
Yeah, it probably cost like a thousand.

608
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,440
Damn, look at that house down there.

609
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,720
[SEAN] The thing about it was, I wasn't
even hunting turkey. I was hunting deer.

610
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,406
I wasn't even trying
to hunt the motherfucker.

That's a bunch of shit, all that.
You don't gotta listen to that.

666
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,040
See, 'cause in Jake's book
there's one fucking step.

667
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,129
Not five, just one.
It just takes one step.

668
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,722
Once you get this one fucking step down,
you're the chief of the tribe.

And I'm gonna teach you
that one step today.

You hear what I'm saying?

671
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,480
Basically, as soon as they
open that door and look at you,

672
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,000
that's the critical moment,
that's the make-or-break moment.

673
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,280
'Cause in that second you gotta work them,

674
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,960
you gotta read them, you gotta be able
to scan them and figure them out,

figure what kind of person
that person wants in their life.

Then you gotta be that person. You know?

So, like, a couple of the
other agents are really rigid

about the five sales steps
and all this shit.

"Oh, you know, my dad, he died in Iraq."

over and over and over again
until it's meaningless.

give a fuck about magazines, right?

Oh, sure.

So if you just pick
two items off this list,

towards making my dreams a reality.

you pick, I get points for.

I don't really read magazines anymore.

[JAKE] Yeah, you could give
the magazines to whoever you want.

765
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,000
I mean, it's less about the magazines

766
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,764
and more about sponsoring
impoverished youths,

767

so that they can chase their dreams

and actually make something
of their lives, you know.

It'd be a belief in me, you know.
I come from nothing, ma'am.

770
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,080
Like I'm an impoverished youth,
bottom barrel,

771
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,840
and this would be my chance to, like,
achieve something more with myself.
