I don't understand

9
00:00:55,511 --> 00:00:56,981
what you're talking about.
What is this break?

10
00:00:57,014 --> 00:00:59,816
Like, I-I... I'm here
as often as I can be.

11
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,384
I'm working two jobs.

12
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:02,952
I don't know what else
you want me to do.

13
00:01:02,986 --> 00:01:04,789
Ah, what a wonderful day.

14
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,727
The sun is out.
The water is shimmering.

15
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:11,795
Scallops are chirping.

16
00:01:11,828 --> 00:01:15,032
So peaceful.

17
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:16,600
Good morning to you, sir.

18
00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:18,902
Would you care to blow a bubble?

19
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:23,734
Oliver.

20
00:07:23,766 --> 00:07:25,735
We're okay. We're okay.

21
00:07:25,768 --> 00:07:28,037
What happened? Huh?

22
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:30,140
Can you use your words, please?

23
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:33,943
There you go.

24
00:07:39,015 --> 00:07:40,984
Something.

25
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:42,919
In.

26
00:07:42,953 --> 00:07:44,121
House.

27
00:07:44,153 --> 00:07:46,255
Something in house.

28
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:48,125
That was probably
just a nightmare,

29
00:07:48,157 --> 00:07:50,259
'cause there is nobody
in the house

30
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:52,228
but your mom and your dad.

31
00:07:52,261 --> 00:07:53,830
All right, come here.

32
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:55,499
Come here, come here, come here.

33
00:07:55,532 --> 00:07:58,435
Can you take some deep breaths
for me, huh?

34
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:02,306
Okay? We're gonna do
some deep breaths.

35
00:08:02,338 --> 00:08:04,807
Okay?

36
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:21,291
So, he woke up in the
middle of the night screaming.

37
00:08:21,323 --> 00:08:23,893
I went in there. I was up
for two hours with him.

38
00:08:23,926 --> 00:08:25,763
He's a little boy.

39
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,098
- He has nightmares.
- That's easy for you to say.

40
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:30,032
You never go in with him.
It's always me.

41
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:31,435
I slept through it.

42
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:33,503
- All right? I'm sorry.
- No, don't do that.

43
00:08:33,537 --> 00:08:35,939
Why can't you just admit
that you don't want to help?

44
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:37,975
I help, okay?

45
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:39,877
I always help... when I'm awake.

46
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:42,044
Hey, buddy.

47
00:08:42,077 --> 00:08:44,148
No more nightmares, huh?

48
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:46,550
I heard you had
a bad dream, bud.

49
00:08:46,582 --> 00:08:48,951
Need a hug?

50
00:08:48,984 --> 00:08:51,888
I know what the problem is.

51
00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:54,859
Too far away.

52
00:08:55,959 --> 00:08:57,527
Yep. Let's see.

53
00:08:57,561 --> 00:09:00,964
Ten feet. Oh, that's definitely
too far for a hug.

54
00:09:00,997 --> 00:09:03,066
What do you think five feet is?

55
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:04,501
Yeah, okay.

56
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:06,102
Little closer.

57
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:08,437
I'm getting the weirdest
reading on this thing.

58
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,806
It just...

59
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,109
Tummy tickles!

60
00:09:12,142 --> 00:09:13,343
Ooh!

61
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:16,012
Your throne, sire.

62
00:09:19,548 --> 00:09:22,518
Are you able to make it
to his speech therapy today?

63
00:09:22,551 --> 00:09:24,153
Oh, sorry, I can't.

64
00:09:24,186 --> 00:09:26,989
Uh, I picked up a shift
at the parking lot.

65
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:29,192
Oh, well, hopefully,
you can make one soon, right?

66
00:09:30,224 --> 00:09:30,527
Yeah, for sure.

67
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,029
Are.

68
00:09:33,562 --> 00:09:35,965
We.

69
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,334
Moving.

70
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:40,304
Are we moving?

71
00:09:45,141 --> 00:09:48,412
You are not moving anywhere,
okay?

72
00:09:48,445 --> 00:09:50,281
So don't worry.

73
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:53,950
Today, we're gonna start in

74
00:09:53,984 --> 00:09:55,619
with multiplying
more than two numbers.

75
00:09:55,652 --> 00:09:57,554
Not cool, man.

76
00:09:57,586 --> 00:10:00,157
You don't even know
what you're groaning about.

77
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,992
It's not so hard.
If you can multiply

78
00:10:02,024 --> 00:10:04,126
two numbers, you can multiply
three. You just take it...

79
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,495
Make sure you pay attention
to the lesson, okay?

80
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:08,231
Anybody want to take this?

81
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:10,399
Come on, you learn by trying.

82
00:10:10,432 --> 00:10:12,468
Nobody?

83
00:10:12,502 --> 00:10:14,171
Oliver.

84
00:10:16,538 --> 00:10:19,409
What do you make
of these three numbers?

85
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,450
The.

86
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:27,584
Answer.

87
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:29,286
Is.

88
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:31,054
Eight.

89
00:10:31,086 --> 00:10:33,289
The answer is eight.

90
00:10:33,322 --> 00:10:35,524
Not quite. I see
what you did there, though.

91
00:10:35,557 --> 00:10:36,926
You were adding
instead of multiplying.

92
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,262
Very good try, Oliver.

93
00:10:38,295 --> 00:10:40,163
Anyone else
want to give it a go?

94
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:41,931
Go ahead, Byron.

95
00:10:41,965 --> 00:10:44,468
How come Oliver still gets
to use his phone in class

96
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,335
but you took mine away?

97
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:48,238
He's autistic, dude.

98
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:50,107
So he gets special treatment?

99
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:52,074
Oliver gets to use his phone

100
00:10:52,108 --> 00:10:53,210
because he wasn't playing
<i>Fortnite</i>

101
00:10:53,243 --> 00:10:54,378
during the Pledge of Allegiance.

102
00:10:54,411 --> 00:10:56,046
Ooh.

103
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,614
Let's get back
to our first pair.

104
00:10:58,648 --> 00:11:02,252
The product of two and four...
why don't we start there?

105
00:11:02,284 --> 00:11:03,986
Try one of those

106
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:06,055
radioactive sludge balls
you call food?

107
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:07,324
Next, I suppose you'll want me

108
00:11:07,356 --> 00:11:08,624
to go square-dancing
with Patrick.

109
00:11:08,657 --> 00:11:10,159
Hey. What's up?

110
00:11:10,192 --> 00:11:12,028
Sorry, Patrick.

111
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:14,632
Do you want to come
hang out with us?

112
00:11:17,267 --> 00:11:18,502
Where?

113
00:11:18,534 --> 00:11:20,670
Oh, uh, it's just...

114
00:11:20,704 --> 00:11:22,973
I saw something cool over there.

115
00:11:28,277 --> 00:11:30,113
That way.

116
00:11:30,146 --> 00:11:32,216
I'll catch up in a sec.

117
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:08,151
Friends.

118
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,560
Hello?

119
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:27,370
Hey.

120
00:12:27,403 --> 00:12:29,038
I can't believe
he actually fell for it.

121
00:12:29,071 --> 00:12:31,207
Of course he did.

122
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,508
- He's such a loser.
- Is he having

123
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:34,076
- a heart attack?
- He totally is.

124
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:35,211
We're supposed to call 911.

125
00:12:35,244 --> 00:12:36,312
Dude, dude, listen.

126
00:12:36,345 --> 00:12:38,347
That's just how he talks.

127
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,082
Moaner Boner.

128
00:12:40,115 --> 00:12:42,686
It's like, he can't even talk.

129
00:12:49,158 --> 00:12:51,427
Exactly. Hey, maybe
he's a robot under his skin.

130
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,196
Moaner Boner thinks he's special.

131
00:12:55,764 --> 00:12:58,167
Oh, did you want
to say something?

132
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,469
I can't believe you used to be

133
00:12:59,502 --> 00:13:00,737
friends with
Moaner Boner over here.

134
00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:02,371
- My mom made me.
- You.

135
00:13:02,404 --> 00:13:03,739
I didn't want to.

136
00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:06,609
Are.

137
00:13:06,643 --> 00:13:08,077
Very.

138
00:13:09,711 --> 00:13:12,548
You are very ugly.

139
00:13:16,652 --> 00:13:18,721
Who's ugly now?

140
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,258
Come on.

141
00:13:42,378 --> 00:13:45,148
<i>I didn't know
what to think when I pulled up</i>

142
00:13:45,181 --> 00:13:47,551
and he wasn't there
waiting for me.

143
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:50,387
I went right into
the worst-case scenarios.

144
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,322
Uh, did he get in trouble?

145
00:13:52,354 --> 00:13:54,324
Did someone take him?

146
00:13:55,758 --> 00:13:59,796
And then I found him
just screaming in the field.

147
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:02,599
That sounds very scary
for both of you.

148
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:05,268
And he lost his phone somehow.

149
00:14:06,536 --> 00:14:08,405
I wish he could explain
what happened.

150
00:14:08,437 --> 00:14:10,506
Good.

151
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,243
Now we're gonna try
using our words.

152
00:14:13,276 --> 00:14:14,678
"Lost...

153
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,580
in field."

154
00:14:17,614 --> 00:14:19,749
We're gonna work
on your F's, okay?

155
00:14:19,782 --> 00:14:21,484
F's can be tricky.

156
00:14:21,518 --> 00:14:23,353
"Field."

157
00:14:23,385 --> 00:14:26,422
"Field." Can you try that?

158
00:14:26,455 --> 00:14:28,558
F...

159
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:32,595
F...

160
00:14:33,595 --> 00:14:35,131
F...

161
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,700
Oliver, you can do it.

162
00:14:36,733 --> 00:14:39,536
F...

163
00:14:42,504 --> 00:14:43,672
Okay.

164
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:46,276
Good practicing.

165
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:48,344
<i>Have you been
trying to provide him</i>

166
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:49,912
<i>with social experiences,</i>

167
00:14:49,946 --> 00:14:51,480
like we discussed?

168
00:14:51,513 --> 00:14:53,282
Poor guy still doesn't have
any friends.

169
00:14:53,316 --> 00:14:58,254
You said he was hanging out
with your friend's son?

170
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:00,257
- Jennifer's son, Byron.
- Yeah.

171
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,226
- Yeah, w-we're not close anymore.
- Okay.

172
00:15:03,258 --> 00:15:06,662
<i>So, if you can make any effort
to help him find friends...</i>

173
00:15:06,696 --> 00:15:09,331
<i>take him to birthday parties,
anything...</i>

174
00:15:09,364 --> 00:15:11,935
<i>it can be a good way
to get him to open up.</i>

175
00:15:11,968 --> 00:15:14,437
<i>And just like he's trying
to get better at talking,</i>

176
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,439
<i>we have to make sure
we're listening.</i>

177
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:23,380
Okay, Patrick,
it's all in the technique.

178
00:15:23,412 --> 00:15:25,315
First, go like this.

179
00:15:25,348 --> 00:15:26,850
Spin around. Stop.

180
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:28,718
Double-take three times.

181
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,553
- One, two, three.
- Come on.

182
00:15:30,586 --> 00:15:32,622
Oliver, you got to stay
with me, okay?

183
00:15:49,638 --> 00:15:51,207
Five bucks, please.

184
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,942
Thanks a lot.

185
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:12,762
Come on.

186
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,479
Oliver, take that box off.

187
00:18:09,512 --> 00:18:10,813
Whoa, buddy.

188
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:12,982
It's time to brush your teeth.

189
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:16,019
He's full of energy tonight.

190
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:17,521
Yeah, he is.

191
00:18:19,021 --> 00:18:20,590
Where'd you get that?

192
00:18:20,622 --> 00:18:22,926
It was at
the lost and found at work.

193
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,994
I think it just
needs to be charged.

194
00:18:25,026 --> 00:18:27,563
I guess you like it, huh?

195
00:18:27,597 --> 00:18:29,632
Hey, be careful with the screen.

196
00:18:29,665 --> 00:18:31,701
It's a little cracked.

197
00:18:31,734 --> 00:18:32,968
- What?
- You know what.

198
00:18:33,002 --> 00:18:34,738
I run around
with our son all day,

199
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:37,407
and you get to swoop in
and be the hero once again?

200
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,674
The hero?

201
00:18:59,695 --> 00:19:02,432
It's not all presents
and tummy tickles with me

202
00:19:02,465 --> 00:19:04,167
like it is with you.

203
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:06,535
I just wish I could take
that part of him

204
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:08,638
and put it in a box
and tape it up

205
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,905
and hide it somewhere

206
00:19:09,938 --> 00:19:12,574
so he didn't have to deal
with it.

207
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:14,845
Then he wouldn't be our Oliver.

208
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,483
I should've...

209
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:23,720
I should've taken him sooner.

210
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:27,924
What if he never learns to talk
because I didn't

211
00:19:27,956 --> 00:19:29,825
- do anything for so long?
- No.

212
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:31,595
We didn't do anything.

213
00:19:34,563 --> 00:19:36,999
He's never looked me
in the eyes.

214
00:19:37,032 --> 00:19:39,135
Do you know what it's like
for your own child

215
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:41,537
to never look you in the eyes?

216
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:46,074
Well...

217
00:19:46,108 --> 00:19:48,878
he's got nice eyes,
if that helps.

218
00:19:52,048 --> 00:19:54,884
No, Marty, it doesn't help,
because he... he loves you

219
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:56,119
and he hates me.

220
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:31,067
Okay, now, how many of you

221
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,202
have played
musical instruments before?

222
00:23:33,234 --> 00:23:35,237
Do instruments of torture count?

223
00:23:35,271 --> 00:23:38,707
- No.
- Is mayonnaise an instrument?

224
00:23:38,741 --> 00:23:41,444
No, Patrick, mayonnaise
is not an instrument.

225
00:24:07,403 --> 00:24:08,871
Is.

226
00:24:08,904 --> 00:24:11,107
Dad.

227
00:24:11,139 --> 00:24:12,876
Gone.

228
00:24:14,976 --> 00:24:17,112
Is Dad gone?

229
00:24:18,513 --> 00:24:20,250
Yes.

230
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:27,891
Hello.

231
00:24:40,002 --> 00:24:42,338
Who.

232
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,107
Are.

233
00:24:45,774 --> 00:24:47,877
You.

234
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:50,479
Who are you?

235
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:12,201
I am Larry.

236
00:25:16,237 --> 00:25:18,840
Your parents want you

237
00:25:18,873 --> 00:25:21,042
to be normal.

238
00:25:21,076 --> 00:25:23,513
I just want

239
00:25:23,545 --> 00:25:26,181
to be your friend.

240
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:35,257
Hi, honey.

241
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:39,328
So, I just had a little chat
with Jennifer.

242
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,164
You know how Dr. Robyn's always

243
00:25:41,196 --> 00:25:43,198
talking about
you making friends?

244
00:25:43,232 --> 00:25:46,035
Well, we're gonna have
a sleepover this weekend.

245
00:25:46,068 --> 00:25:47,503
I know it's scary.

246
00:25:47,535 --> 00:25:49,337
I'm nervous, too.

247
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:53,842
I haven't really seen Jennifer
since that whole incident,

248
00:25:53,876 --> 00:25:56,780
but can you try and have
some fun for me?

249
00:26:01,516 --> 00:26:05,888
You noticed your dad's gone
earlier than usual, huh?

250
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,390
I have something
I need to talk to you about.

251
00:26:08,424 --> 00:26:11,093
Um, I've been wanting
to talk to you about it

252
00:26:11,126 --> 00:26:12,862
for a while, but I've just...

253
00:26:12,895 --> 00:26:15,097
I haven't been sure what to say.

254
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:17,999
Your dad and I love you so much.

255
00:26:18,032 --> 00:26:20,069
I don't want you to feel alone.

256
00:26:20,101 --> 00:26:23,305
That's why we're gonna have
the sleepover this weekend.

257
00:26:44,092 --> 00:26:45,460
Is that your way of saying

258
00:26:45,494 --> 00:26:47,562
you don't want to talk to me
about it?

259
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,122
- Hi.
- Hi.

260
00:27:14,156 --> 00:27:15,590
- How are you?
- Thank you for coming.

261
00:27:15,623 --> 00:27:17,425
- Nice to see you.
- You, too.

262
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:20,897
So, I hope you're gonna be okay
with these guys.

263
00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:23,666
They can be a little bit
of a handful.

264
00:27:23,698 --> 00:27:25,301
Oh.

265
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:27,003
Yeah, I think we'll be fine.

266
00:27:27,035 --> 00:27:29,237
Byron just felt more
comfortable with his posse.

267
00:27:29,271 --> 00:27:32,541
- You're welcome to stay for a while.
- Oh.

268
00:27:32,573 --> 00:27:34,342
And spend more time with Byron
than I have to?

269
00:27:34,376 --> 00:27:35,978
- Mom.
- Yes.

270
00:27:36,011 --> 00:27:38,214
I'm just kidding, honey.

271
00:27:38,246 --> 00:27:40,282
Not kidding.

272
00:27:41,282 --> 00:27:44,654
So, um, can I say hi?

273
00:27:44,686 --> 00:27:46,656
Oh, yeah. Of course, yes.

274
00:27:46,688 --> 00:27:48,323
Yeah.

275
00:27:49,725 --> 00:27:51,526
Oliver.

276
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,561
You remember Jennifer, right?

277
00:27:53,594 --> 00:27:55,163
Hi, Oliver.

278
00:27:56,465 --> 00:27:58,667
Why does he do that
weird thing with his fingers?

279
00:27:58,701 --> 00:28:01,070
- Okay, be nice, guys.
- No, it's okay. Um...

280
00:28:01,102 --> 00:28:03,171
It helps calm him down.

281
00:28:03,205 --> 00:28:05,174
- It's called stimming.
- Okay.

282
00:28:05,206 --> 00:28:06,574
But why?

283
00:28:06,608 --> 00:28:09,712
Well, he's under-sensitive
to stimulation,

284
00:28:09,744 --> 00:28:12,180
so sometimes he needs
to touch his own skin

285
00:28:12,214 --> 00:28:15,216
or spin in a circle,
and it makes him feel good.

286
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,520
Can he spin forever
without puking?

287
00:28:17,552 --> 00:28:19,522
Sure seems like it.

288
00:28:19,554 --> 00:28:21,423
That's kind of cool.

289
00:28:21,456 --> 00:28:23,126
Come on, Oliver.

290
00:28:24,193 --> 00:28:25,394
Hi, Oliver.

291
00:28:25,426 --> 00:28:27,495
It's really nice
to see you, honey.

292
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:29,231
My gosh, you've gotten big.

293
00:28:29,263 --> 00:28:31,233
Yeah. Yeah, he's...
he's still not talking,

294
00:28:31,265 --> 00:28:34,003
but his writing
has really improved.

295
00:28:34,035 --> 00:28:37,005
- That's awesome.
- Mm-hmm.

296
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,641
High five?

297
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,013
Whoa. Still strong.

298
00:28:44,045 --> 00:28:46,247
Okay, that is not gonna happen,

299
00:28:46,281 --> 00:28:49,417
because he knows now
to keep his hands to himself.

300
00:28:49,451 --> 00:28:51,320
- Of course.
- Right, Oliver?

301
00:28:51,352 --> 00:28:54,489
Well, the boys have
all agreed to include Oliver,

302
00:28:54,523 --> 00:28:57,392
so I'm sure it's just gonna be
a really great night.

303
00:29:20,482 --> 00:29:23,285
Is he gonna make
those sounds the whole night?

304
00:29:23,318 --> 00:29:25,221
Keep it down.

305
00:29:34,128 --> 00:29:36,398
Isn't it sad that your mom
has to force kids

306
00:29:36,432 --> 00:29:38,634
to come over and pretend
to be your friend?

307
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:40,369
What are you
staring at, anyway?

308
00:29:40,401 --> 00:29:43,238
Moaner Boner's been looking
at that closet all night.

309
00:29:43,272 --> 00:29:46,274
Maybe that's where he keeps
his secret candy stash.

310
00:29:48,276 --> 00:29:49,644
What? Are you guys telling me

311
00:29:49,677 --> 00:29:51,414
you don't have
a secret candy stash?

312
00:29:51,446 --> 00:29:53,349
I'm gonna check it out.

313
00:30:02,491 --> 00:30:04,460
Do you see any candy?

314
00:30:21,176 --> 00:30:22,778
Hey!

315
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:25,080
What's your deal?
We all got these.

316
00:30:25,113 --> 00:30:26,781
Aw, does he think
we're gonna steal it?

317
00:30:26,814 --> 00:30:29,517
Want to see what kind of games
you got on here.

318
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,554
What's this?

319
00:30:32,588 --> 00:30:34,523
Does your mommy still read you
bedtime stories?

320
00:30:39,194 --> 00:30:40,596
"This is Larry."

321
00:30:40,628 --> 00:30:42,465
Who's Larry?

322
00:30:42,497 --> 00:30:44,165
Yeah, who's Larry?

323
00:30:44,198 --> 00:30:45,400
This guy.

324
00:30:45,434 --> 00:30:47,735
Whoa. Look at that dude.

325
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:49,472
Yeah.
He looks just like your dad.

326
00:30:49,504 --> 00:30:50,738
Shut up.

327
00:30:50,772 --> 00:30:53,208
My dad is way hairier.

328
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:57,378
"Larry never gets to play pretend.

329
00:30:57,411 --> 00:30:59,547
He gets made fun of
because he's different."

330
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,852
Okay, did your parents
forget to pay

331
00:31:02,885 --> 00:31:04,720
the electricity bill?

332
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:09,825
"Larry just wants a friend."

333
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:14,396
Are you guys seriously
afraid of a dead light bulb?

334
00:31:16,732 --> 00:31:18,701
Two dead light bulbs.

335
00:31:32,481 --> 00:31:35,584
"He's tall and pale and thin

336
00:31:35,617 --> 00:31:37,753
"and tries to hide his face.

337
00:31:39,554 --> 00:31:41,623
"He isn't from
the world you know.

338
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:46,494
Larry comes from another place."

339
00:31:46,528 --> 00:31:48,764
Uh, maybe we should
stop reading.

340
00:31:55,637 --> 00:31:57,639
"Larry watches
through your windows,

341
00:31:57,673 --> 00:32:00,776
"which connect
his realm to yours.

342
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:02,744
"He needs you to know
his whole story

343
00:32:02,778 --> 00:32:05,314
to turn those windows
into doors."

344
00:32:05,347 --> 00:32:06,815
What does that mean?

345
00:32:09,584 --> 00:32:10,818
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

346
00:32:10,851 --> 00:32:13,688
Shit! Shit!

347
00:32:13,722 --> 00:32:14,924
Oh, my God.

348
00:32:14,956 --> 00:32:16,457
What's going on?

349
00:32:16,491 --> 00:32:18,194
Oh, my God!

350
00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:23,766
Oh, my God!

351
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:34,275
Come on.

352
00:32:52,561 --> 00:32:55,731
Are you making
those sounds, Moaner Boner?

353
00:33:52,888 --> 00:33:56,324
What the shit is that?

354
00:33:56,358 --> 00:33:57,859
Shit.

355
00:33:57,892 --> 00:33:59,995
Shit, shit, shit.

356
00:34:06,702 --> 00:34:09,338
- What the hell kind of app is this?
- Is it an app?

357
00:34:09,371 --> 00:34:11,507
Should I read the next page?
I'm gonna read the next page.

358
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,442
No, no, no.
Don't read the next page.

359
00:34:14,476 --> 00:34:16,045
"Larry has looked
through the glass

360
00:34:16,078 --> 00:34:17,946
"and found you staring back.

361
00:34:17,978 --> 00:34:19,814
"He understands your loneliness.

362
00:34:19,848 --> 00:34:21,951
"A true friend is what you lack.

363
00:34:24,752 --> 00:34:26,020
Will you be Larry's friend?"

364
00:34:26,054 --> 00:34:29,925
No! No, I will not
be Larry's friend.

365
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:33,095
Guys, guys, th-there's nothing
in the corner.

366
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:34,696
- No. No, no, no.
- No. No, no, no.

367
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:35,998
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

368
00:34:36,031 --> 00:34:37,632
- Don't! No, don't!
- No, don't! Don't!

369
00:34:42,603 --> 00:34:44,439
See?

370
00:34:48,043 --> 00:34:50,446
It's probably just a fuse.

371
00:34:50,478 --> 00:34:52,348
Do you see him?

372
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,815
Do you see Larry?

373
00:34:53,848 --> 00:34:55,984
Guys, there's
no such thing as Larry.

374
00:34:56,016 --> 00:34:58,587
It's just your imagination
playing tricks on you.

375
00:35:07,061 --> 00:35:09,031
What is happening?

376
00:35:09,063 --> 00:35:10,799
Oh, my God!

377
00:35:10,831 --> 00:35:12,868
Byron, are you okay?

378
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,710
I don't know how this happened.

379
00:35:22,743 --> 00:35:24,746
I don't see how Oliver
could've done this.

380
00:35:24,779 --> 00:35:27,715
Byron, baby?

381
00:35:27,748 --> 00:35:30,118
Do you think you can tell us
what happened now?

382
00:35:30,152 --> 00:35:31,686
Who did this?

383
00:35:33,889 --> 00:35:36,825
It was... it was Oliver.

384
00:35:36,857 --> 00:35:39,094
He's a freak.

385
00:35:40,529 --> 00:35:43,065
- Excuse me?
- Let's go.

386
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,503
Jennifer, I... I'm sorry.

387
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:49,538
I am so sorry.

388
00:35:49,571 --> 00:35:51,906
We got to go.

389
00:36:09,657 --> 00:36:11,893
How did you blow out
all of these lights?

390
00:36:13,494 --> 00:36:14,763
I don't understand.

391
00:36:14,795 --> 00:36:16,831
Were you trying
to hurt Byron again?

392
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,969
Not you?

393
00:36:22,002 --> 00:36:23,871
Well, who else
could it have been?

394
00:36:23,904 --> 00:36:25,173
You know, if you want friends,

395
00:36:25,206 --> 00:36:26,674
you can't push furniture
into them.

396
00:36:28,009 --> 00:36:29,978
Will you at least help me
move this table?

397
00:36:30,011 --> 00:36:31,980
Please stop humming.

398
00:36:32,013 --> 00:36:34,016
We are not happy right now.
This...

399
00:36:35,884 --> 00:36:38,487
Is that the <i>SpongeBob</i> song?

400
00:36:57,739 --> 00:37:01,177
You don't...
you don't have to stop.

401
00:37:03,011 --> 00:37:05,014
Does that help you calm down?

402
00:37:06,915 --> 00:37:09,884
Maybe I pushed you
into this too fast.

403
00:37:11,185 --> 00:37:13,187
We've got a lot going on
in this house,

404
00:37:13,221 --> 00:37:16,257
and maybe we're just
not ready for friends.

405
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:27,735
Let's fly on over

406
00:37:27,768 --> 00:37:29,237
to the Midwestern region.

407
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:32,607
Which one is this?
North or South Dakota?

408
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:34,042
South Dakota.

409
00:37:34,074 --> 00:37:35,710
That's right.

410
00:37:35,743 --> 00:37:39,146
Underneath South Dakota is...?

411
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:42,250
- Nebraska?
- Nebraska.

412
00:37:42,284 --> 00:37:44,286
Jade, what's under Nebraska?

413
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:45,786
Kansas.

414
00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:47,855
Kansas. Nice one.

415
00:37:47,889 --> 00:37:51,059
Oliver, do you want
to give this one a try?

416
00:37:51,092 --> 00:37:53,596
Oliver, did you bring
your talker today?

417
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,600
Another day.

418
00:37:59,801 --> 00:38:01,569
And under Kansas?

419
00:38:02,603 --> 00:38:04,172
Oklahoma?

420
00:39:17,978 --> 00:39:20,281
<i>Misunderstood Monsters.</i>

421
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:24,052
"This is Larry.

422
00:39:25,886 --> 00:39:28,122
"Larry never gets
to play pretend.

423
00:39:28,156 --> 00:39:31,159
"He gets made fun of
because he's different.

424
00:39:31,192 --> 00:39:33,161
Larry just wants a friend."

425
00:40:22,777 --> 00:40:24,346
Marty?

426
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,893
Hello?

427
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,810
Hello?

428
00:41:30,277 --> 00:41:31,812
Hello.

429
00:41:41,522 --> 00:41:44,325
Is somebody watching me?

430
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:47,496
Oliver, what the hell
did you download on this thing?

431
00:41:47,529 --> 00:41:51,433
Say goodbye to Oliver.

432
00:41:51,465 --> 00:41:53,400
Have you been talking to my son?

433
00:41:53,433 --> 00:41:56,203
You need to stop.
This is not funny.

434
00:42:02,409 --> 00:42:06,415
Stay away from my son.
I won't let you hurt him.

435
00:42:07,514 --> 00:42:09,752
Not hurt.

436
00:42:12,085 --> 00:42:14,355
Take.

437
00:42:14,389 --> 00:42:15,857
Take, take,

438
00:42:15,889 --> 00:42:18,192
take, take, take, take.

439
00:42:29,036 --> 00:42:32,507
Why? To collect and...

440
00:42:34,007 --> 00:42:36,377
- Everything okay?
- Sorry. Uh, Oliver?

441
00:42:36,411 --> 00:42:38,446
- Is Oliver here?
- Yeah.

442
00:42:38,478 --> 00:42:40,381
Thank God you're all right.

443
00:42:40,415 --> 00:42:42,150
We got to go.

444
00:42:42,183 --> 00:42:47,121
We have a family emergency,
so we're just gonna go.

445
00:42:50,491 --> 00:42:53,561
We just got to get you home,
okay?

446
00:42:53,594 --> 00:42:56,464
I know. I know this isn't
part of your routine.

447
00:42:56,496 --> 00:42:58,533
It's just...

448
00:43:00,034 --> 00:43:02,369
Someone was watching us at home.

449
00:43:02,402 --> 00:43:04,973
They said they want to take you.

450
00:43:05,005 --> 00:43:07,275
Oh.

451
00:43:09,444 --> 00:43:12,114
Hi. Jen, I can't...

452
00:43:13,647 --> 00:43:16,250
What do you mean,
he's not talking?

453
00:43:17,552 --> 00:43:20,488
I don't know what
they got up to this weekend,

454
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,924
but Byron,
he still hasn't slept.

455
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:25,327
Won't go to school.

456
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,429
Won't eat.

457
00:43:27,462 --> 00:43:29,431
Two days with him not talking,
and...

458
00:43:29,464 --> 00:43:31,400
I seriously don't know
how you do it.

459
00:43:33,134 --> 00:43:36,471
I think someone hacked
into Oliver's screen.

460
00:43:36,503 --> 00:43:39,241
Someone was talking to me.

461
00:43:47,915 --> 00:43:50,951
SpongeBob, I just want
to say that I'm...

462
00:43:50,985 --> 00:43:53,021
sorry.

463
00:43:53,054 --> 00:43:54,122
What?

464
00:43:54,154 --> 00:43:57,359
I'm trying to say I'm...

465
00:43:59,594 --> 00:44:01,429
What?

466
00:44:01,462 --> 00:44:03,898
I mean, how could someone
use that to get to...

467
00:44:08,268 --> 00:44:10,437
Honey, it's nice of you
to try and apologize,

468
00:44:10,471 --> 00:44:13,308
but I don't think he wants
to watch <i>SpongeBob</i> right now.

469
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,509
It was Larry.

470
00:44:16,043 --> 00:44:17,612
Honey?

471
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,049
Oliver didn't do anything.

472
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:22,417
It was Larry.

473
00:44:22,449 --> 00:44:23,685
Who's Larry?

474
00:44:23,717 --> 00:44:27,554
I read about Larry today
in that story.

475
00:44:27,587 --> 00:44:30,457
Tell me what you saw, please.

476
00:44:30,491 --> 00:44:32,393
Larry just wants a friend.

477
00:44:32,427 --> 00:44:35,330
H-He made the lights go out.

478
00:44:37,297 --> 00:44:39,533
I-I could hear him in the house.

479
00:44:39,567 --> 00:44:42,536
H-He moved things, but...

480
00:44:42,569 --> 00:44:44,906
but I couldn't see him.

481
00:44:45,706 --> 00:44:47,574
Not really.

482
00:44:47,607 --> 00:44:50,077
So, you guys
played make-believe?

483
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:51,545
No.

484
00:44:53,348 --> 00:44:56,685
He's the one that hurt me,
not Oliver.

485
00:44:56,717 --> 00:44:58,686
Larry.

486
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:01,121
I could feel him.

487
00:45:01,154 --> 00:45:03,290
His hands around my neck.

488
00:45:08,128 --> 00:45:10,098
He tried to kill me.

489
00:45:12,266 --> 00:45:14,036
Larry just wants a friend.

490
00:45:15,036 --> 00:45:16,938
Larry just wants a friend.

491
00:45:17,739 --> 00:45:19,574
Larry just wants a friend.

492
00:45:20,574 --> 00:45:22,944
<i>Larry just wants a friend.</i>

493
00:45:26,647 --> 00:45:28,382
Hurry! Oliver!

494
00:45:28,415 --> 00:45:30,952
We got to get to Dad.
We can't stay here.

495
00:45:34,389 --> 00:45:38,326
Honey, I'm sure it's nothing,
but better to be safe, right?

496
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:40,194
Can you look at me?

497
00:45:43,498 --> 00:45:45,701
We should get going, okay?

498
00:45:47,235 --> 00:45:49,271
And no screens.

499
00:47:50,491 --> 00:47:52,159
Oliver!

500
00:48:26,393 --> 00:48:28,795
What are you talking about?

501
00:48:28,828 --> 00:48:31,198
I know it sounds crazy,

502
00:48:31,232 --> 00:48:33,768
but I was reading this story
about Larry,

503
00:48:33,801 --> 00:48:35,770
and then the lights...

504
00:48:35,802 --> 00:48:38,306
they started going on and off.

505
00:48:38,339 --> 00:48:42,143
And then another one
was going on and off.

506
00:48:43,511 --> 00:48:45,779
It was like he was using
the electricity

507
00:48:45,813 --> 00:48:47,382
to move around the room.

508
00:48:47,415 --> 00:48:50,851
And then he screwed in
all the new light bulbs.

509
00:48:50,884 --> 00:48:53,220
So, he helped you
with your chores.

510
00:48:54,922 --> 00:48:59,293
He must have needed the power
or something to come alive.

511
00:48:59,326 --> 00:49:01,362
- Larry?
- Larry.

512
00:49:02,496 --> 00:49:04,766
I knew I shouldn't
have moved out.

513
00:49:05,766 --> 00:49:07,534
I'm not making this up.

514
00:49:07,567 --> 00:49:09,836
Oliver saw him.

515
00:49:09,869 --> 00:49:15,275
There is something
inside our house.

516
00:49:15,308 --> 00:49:18,345
O-Oliver, here.

517
00:49:18,378 --> 00:49:19,915
Tell Daddy.

518
00:49:23,317 --> 00:49:24,953
He.

519
00:49:24,985 --> 00:49:26,920
Wants. Me.

520
00:49:26,953 --> 00:49:29,456
As. Friend.

521
00:49:29,489 --> 00:49:32,560
This thing wants our son.

522
00:49:32,592 --> 00:49:34,395
Okay.

523
00:49:34,427 --> 00:49:37,331
I think you need
a good night's sleep.

524
00:49:37,364 --> 00:49:38,966
I'll take him to school
in the morning.

525
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,402
No, I am not letting him
out of our sight.

526
00:49:41,435 --> 00:49:43,270
How do we know
the school is safe?

527
00:49:43,304 --> 00:49:45,673
Okay, well, why don't I bring
him to work with me tonight

528
00:49:45,706 --> 00:49:47,242
if he's not going
to school tomorrow?

529
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,710
Absolutely not.

530
00:49:48,743 --> 00:49:50,744
Oh, come on. What, you don't
trust me with him?

531
00:49:50,777 --> 00:49:52,546
No, it's not that. It's...

532
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:55,882
Rest is important for the body.

533
00:49:55,915 --> 00:49:58,485
So, you sleep, and...

534
00:49:58,518 --> 00:50:00,955
we can talk about
all this tomorrow.

535
00:50:02,556 --> 00:50:04,891
Really, come on.

536
00:50:04,924 --> 00:50:07,261
Let me take care of him.

537
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,770
Give this and the change
to the gentleman.

538
00:50:16,804 --> 00:50:18,673
There you go.

539
00:50:18,706 --> 00:50:20,341
Thanks so much.

540
00:50:20,373 --> 00:50:22,909
Have a good one.

541
00:50:22,942 --> 00:50:25,279
My man is a pro!

542
00:50:26,846 --> 00:50:28,782
Very nicely done.

543
00:50:28,815 --> 00:50:31,319
See? Look how good
you are at that.

544
00:50:31,351 --> 00:50:33,754
You could take over for me some nights.

545
00:50:33,788 --> 00:50:34,989
The best part is that,
in between cars,

546
00:50:35,022 --> 00:50:36,023
you can do whatever you want.

547
00:50:36,056 --> 00:50:38,058
You can listen to the radio.

548
00:50:38,092 --> 00:50:40,328
You can even watch <i>SpongeBob.</i>

549
00:50:47,868 --> 00:50:49,471
Oh, hey.

550
00:50:50,705 --> 00:50:53,808
Ah. Is this the infamous haunted screen?

551
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,842
It's okay.

552
00:50:55,875 --> 00:50:58,612
Hey. Do you know how
your nightmares aren't real?

553
00:50:58,645 --> 00:51:02,015
Well, neither are ghosts or
ghouls or vampires or witches,

554
00:51:02,049 --> 00:51:04,052
and certainly not Larrys.

555
00:51:04,085 --> 00:51:06,621
"This is Larry."

556
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:42,857
"Will you be Larry's friend?"

557
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:05,413
It's nothing.

558
00:52:05,446 --> 00:52:07,014
Happens all the time.

559
00:52:07,047 --> 00:52:09,016
It's okay.

560
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:11,919
Huh.

561
00:52:14,554 --> 00:52:15,857
Hang tight.

562
00:52:31,071 --> 00:52:33,407
All right.

563
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:38,645
Let's see what we have here.

564
00:55:16,936 --> 00:55:18,739
Oliver, what are you doing, buddy?

565
00:55:18,772 --> 00:55:20,975
What if a car drove in? Huh?

566
00:55:21,007 --> 00:55:23,043
You got to be more careful.

567
00:55:28,382 --> 00:55:29,850
Hey. Here.

568
00:55:29,882 --> 00:55:31,085
Give me this.

569
00:55:31,118 --> 00:55:32,953
Look. Hey.

570
00:55:32,987 --> 00:55:34,221
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Look.

571
00:55:34,253 --> 00:55:36,022
Buddy, there's nothing.

572
00:55:36,056 --> 00:55:37,592
Hey. Look at me.

573
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:40,194
Okay? There's nothing out there.

574
00:55:40,226 --> 00:55:42,330
Okay? I'll show you. Look.

575
00:55:44,897 --> 00:55:47,033
See?

576
00:55:47,067 --> 00:55:48,703
Look at that.

577
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:58,878
See?

578
00:56:00,279 --> 00:56:01,915
Totally safe.

579
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:12,959
Oliver!

580
00:56:12,993 --> 00:56:15,096
Let him go!

581
00:56:30,944 --> 00:56:32,913
Okay.

582
00:56:32,946 --> 00:56:36,183
Okay. Okay.

583
00:56:36,215 --> 00:56:39,786
I saw through that-that...
that screen

584
00:56:39,819 --> 00:56:42,122
the way he was holding Oliver.

585
00:56:42,156 --> 00:56:44,358
Why does he want our son?

586
00:56:44,391 --> 00:56:47,427
The story said something,
um, about, uh...

587
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,229
"A true friend
is what you lack."

588
00:56:49,263 --> 00:56:52,433
He hasn't had a friend
since-since...

589
00:56:52,465 --> 00:56:55,168
Oh, yeah, since Jennifer and I
got in our fight.

590
00:56:55,201 --> 00:56:57,337
- I know.
- Yeah, some stupid fight.

591
00:56:57,371 --> 00:56:59,006
Hey, Oliver hit Byron,

592
00:56:59,038 --> 00:57:01,375
and then she decided
our son was dangerous.

593
00:57:02,976 --> 00:57:05,146
Either way, he's been lonely
long before that.

594
00:57:05,179 --> 00:57:06,714
I mean, Oliver's been staring

595
00:57:06,746 --> 00:57:08,449
at his screens for years,
and that...

596
00:57:08,482 --> 00:57:10,851
that thing has been
staring right back.

597
00:57:10,884 --> 00:57:12,719
And how come
we can't see it, huh?

598
00:57:12,752 --> 00:57:14,220
I-I don't know.

599
00:57:14,253 --> 00:57:15,989
Doesn't make any sense.

600
00:57:16,022 --> 00:57:18,892
How-how can he be here
and not here at the same time?

601
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:21,962
What have you got, honey?

602
00:57:22,962 --> 00:57:25,365
That's very nice.

603
00:57:43,449 --> 00:57:45,218
We got some kid.

604
00:57:45,252 --> 00:57:47,955
Larry's in his world,
and we're in ours, but...

605
00:57:47,987 --> 00:57:50,223
But we're also together.

606
00:57:50,257 --> 00:57:54,095
Larry can interact with us,
but he can't reach us.

607
00:57:54,127 --> 00:57:55,962
He can't get to Oliver yet.

608
00:57:55,996 --> 00:57:58,232
That's why he wants
to get into our world.

609
00:57:58,264 --> 00:58:01,101
If that's his window...

610
00:58:01,134 --> 00:58:04,104
Then we have to destroy it
before it becomes his door.

611
00:58:39,373 --> 00:58:41,942
We have the cookie,
we have the blue car,

612
00:58:41,975 --> 00:58:45,011
and you get to choose...
whichever one you want.

613
00:58:45,045 --> 00:58:46,880
What's it gonna be?

614
00:58:46,913 --> 00:58:48,214
Yeah. Good.

615
00:58:48,248 --> 00:58:50,384
Marty and I
both experienced it.

616
00:58:50,417 --> 00:58:53,052
It's not just
in Oliver's imagination.

617
00:58:53,085 --> 00:58:54,988
I'll be right back, kiddo.

618
00:58:57,523 --> 00:59:02,996
Sarah, do you know
what a physical empath is?

619
00:59:03,029 --> 00:59:04,430
No.

620
00:59:04,464 --> 00:59:07,835
It's when you love
someone so much

621
00:59:07,868 --> 00:59:10,571
that you feel or experience
their pain.

622
00:59:10,603 --> 00:59:12,205
It's a good sign.

623
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:14,175
It shows just how much
you care about Oliver.

624
00:59:14,208 --> 00:59:16,277
And it's very common in parents.

625
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:19,947
So, you're saying that we could
be seeing his imagination

626
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,415
because we love him?

627
00:59:21,447 --> 00:59:23,183
That doesn't make any sense.

628
00:59:23,217 --> 00:59:24,585
But an invisible monster

629
00:59:24,618 --> 00:59:26,554
that travels
through electricity does?

630
00:59:28,621 --> 00:59:30,924
Well, we're hoping
that that's over now

631
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:32,526
because we destroyed that thing.

632
00:59:32,558 --> 00:59:36,062
So, does he have a way
to communicate?

633
00:59:37,063 --> 00:59:38,565
I'll...

634
00:59:38,598 --> 00:59:40,867
let him take my phone
with him to school

635
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,837
until we can afford a new one.

636
00:59:42,869 --> 00:59:44,904
Unless you could get him
talking first.

637
00:59:44,938 --> 00:59:46,607
Sarah.

638
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:48,609
Come on, it's...

639
00:59:48,641 --> 00:59:51,011
it's extremely rare
for kids his age

640
00:59:51,043 --> 00:59:53,480
to start verbalizing in the way
I fear you're imagining.

641
00:59:53,513 --> 00:59:56,616
I know. I know.

642
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:59,987
I just...
I just want to make sure

643
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:02,389
that you still have
the right expectations.

644
01:00:02,422 --> 01:00:04,558
If he can say a few words...

645
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:06,594
maybe a sentence here or there...

646
01:00:06,627 --> 01:00:08,596
that would be a big win.

647
01:00:08,628 --> 01:00:12,266
We have to keep remembering
his strengths.

648
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:20,141
Have you seen him again?

649
01:00:30,284 --> 01:00:32,320
What's this?

650
01:00:33,453 --> 01:00:35,522
He. Gave.

651
01:00:35,554 --> 01:00:39,326
It. To. Me.

652
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:41,628
Seriously?

653
01:00:41,661 --> 01:00:43,330
Yes.

654
01:00:43,362 --> 01:00:48,067
Then Mom and Dad broke him.

655
01:00:48,101 --> 01:00:50,170
Broke him?

656
01:00:50,203 --> 01:00:53,172
S-So, like, he's gone, then?

657
01:00:53,206 --> 01:00:55,376
Yes.

658
01:01:09,556 --> 01:01:12,092
Can I ask you something?

659
01:01:12,125 --> 01:01:13,393
Yes.

660
01:01:13,427 --> 01:01:16,130
Why'd you stop being my friend?

661
01:01:17,397 --> 01:01:20,368
We used to hang out
all the time.

662
01:01:22,368 --> 01:01:25,138
I. Did.

663
01:01:25,172 --> 01:01:27,273
Bad. Thing.

664
01:01:27,306 --> 01:01:28,641
You did?

665
01:01:28,674 --> 01:01:31,077
Punch. Face.

666
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:34,248
Your. Mom. Mad.

667
01:01:34,281 --> 01:01:36,350
I barely even had a bruise.

668
01:01:36,382 --> 01:01:38,217
The next day,
I was asking my mom

669
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:40,321
when we could have
another sleepover.

670
01:01:40,353 --> 01:01:43,256
But she played me
a message from your mom.

671
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:46,060
Your mom said you didn't want
to be my friend anymore.

672
01:01:49,261 --> 01:01:52,332
That is lie.

673
01:01:52,366 --> 01:01:53,967
Wait.

674
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,502
So, you never said that?

675
01:01:56,536 --> 01:01:58,973
Lie.

676
01:01:59,005 --> 01:02:00,674
Wrong.

677
01:02:00,706 --> 01:02:03,076
I never.

678
01:02:05,277 --> 01:02:06,647
Lie.

679
01:02:09,549 --> 01:02:11,552
Moms are so weird.

680
01:02:11,585 --> 01:02:13,420
What are you watching
over there?

681
01:02:13,453 --> 01:02:14,655
Wait.

682
01:02:14,688 --> 01:02:16,423
Let me guess.

683
01:02:16,456 --> 01:02:18,258
<i>SpongeBob?</i>

684
01:02:50,156 --> 01:02:51,424
No.

685
01:04:20,313 --> 01:04:21,682
No!

686
01:04:23,282 --> 01:04:24,750
Help!

687
01:04:24,784 --> 01:04:26,386
Hello!

688
01:04:26,418 --> 01:04:28,254
Somebody help!

689
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:01,342
Where are you?

690
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:04,978
No!

691
01:07:05,011 --> 01:07:07,346
Shit.

692
01:07:44,817 --> 01:07:46,919
You need any help
with your homework?

693
01:07:51,458 --> 01:07:53,793
Hey, I talked to Jennifer today.

694
01:07:53,826 --> 01:07:56,462
She said Byron's doing
much better.

695
01:08:06,105 --> 01:08:07,741
Hello?

696
01:08:09,509 --> 01:08:11,110
How?

697
01:08:11,143 --> 01:08:13,679
We found him in his
car on the side of the road.

698
01:08:13,712 --> 01:08:16,782
We're not sure how it happened.
He was unresponsive.

699
01:08:16,816 --> 01:08:18,919
W-We rushed him
to the hospital...

700
01:08:18,951 --> 01:08:21,387
Hello?

701
01:08:25,657 --> 01:08:26,959
Hello?

702
01:08:26,993 --> 01:08:28,995
Hello!

703
01:08:48,681 --> 01:08:50,717
Welcome to the Krusty Krab.

704
01:08:50,749 --> 01:08:53,018
How may I help you?

705
01:08:53,052 --> 01:08:54,955
- Yeah...
- Did you turn it on?

706
01:08:54,987 --> 01:08:56,990
...two large fries
and a Jumbo Krabby Patty.

707
01:08:57,022 --> 01:08:58,657
Hey! What's that?

708
01:09:00,192 --> 01:09:02,161
What are you doing
behind the counter?!

709
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:12,539
- He...
- Will...

710
01:09:12,571 --> 01:09:13,873
- Follow...
- You...

711
01:09:15,008 --> 01:09:16,676
- Until...
- You...

712
01:09:16,709 --> 01:09:17,844
- Finish...
- The...

713
01:09:17,877 --> 01:09:20,914
Story.

714
01:09:20,946 --> 01:09:23,549
Why are you doing this to us?

715
01:09:25,084 --> 01:09:27,121
Where did you come from?

716
01:09:32,691 --> 01:09:34,660
- World...
- Only...

717
01:09:34,694 --> 01:09:36,196
- Look...
- At...

718
01:09:36,228 --> 01:09:38,197
- Screens...
- Not...

719
01:09:38,231 --> 01:09:39,532
Each other.

720
01:09:39,566 --> 01:09:41,802
What?

721
01:09:41,834 --> 01:09:44,036
What does that mean?

722
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:46,139
- People...
- Very...

723
01:09:46,172 --> 01:09:47,040
Lonely.

724
01:09:47,072 --> 01:09:49,109
- All...
- That...

725
01:09:49,142 --> 01:09:50,710
- Loneliness...
- In...

726
01:09:50,743 --> 01:09:52,846
- World...
- Made...

727
01:09:52,879 --> 01:09:54,815
Larry.

728
01:09:54,847 --> 01:09:56,682
- Larry...
- Made...

729
01:09:56,715 --> 01:09:58,986
- Of...
- Loneliness.

730
01:10:00,085 --> 01:10:02,054
Larry is lonely?

731
01:10:03,255 --> 01:10:07,593
How do you think I would feel
if Larry took Oliver?

732
01:10:12,731 --> 01:10:14,133
- Finish...
- The...

733
01:10:14,167 --> 01:10:15,535
Story.

734
01:10:15,567 --> 01:10:16,936
- Finish...
- The...

735
01:10:16,969 --> 01:10:18,038
Story.

736
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:19,205
No.

737
01:10:25,879 --> 01:10:27,681
No, no, no, no.

738
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:40,627
No. Stop. Stop.

739
01:11:00,847 --> 01:11:02,581
No. No!

740
01:11:02,615 --> 01:11:03,851
No.

741
01:11:55,133 --> 01:11:58,804
Can you just be normal
for one second?

742
01:12:05,044 --> 01:12:06,746
Oliver.

743
01:12:06,779 --> 01:12:08,848
Oliver, I didn't mean it.

744
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:13,654
Honey.

745
01:12:15,288 --> 01:12:17,691
Sometimes...

746
01:12:17,723 --> 01:12:20,726
even moms and dads say things
that they shouldn't.

747
01:12:22,762 --> 01:12:24,731
I just... I...

748
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:29,369
Your dad...

749
01:12:29,401 --> 01:12:33,639
he's been in an accident,
and, um...

750
01:12:33,673 --> 01:12:35,842
they're trying to wake him up.

751
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:42,014
Something happened to him,
and I think it was Larry.

752
01:12:42,048 --> 01:12:45,085
And I cannot let Larry
get us, too.

753
01:13:12,779 --> 01:13:14,313
Oh, my God.

754
01:14:49,075 --> 01:14:52,946
Okay. Okay. Okay.

755
01:15:20,272 --> 01:15:22,808
We're gonna go for the door.

756
01:15:22,842 --> 01:15:25,044
Stay quiet.

757
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:51,404
Oliver.

758
01:15:51,437 --> 01:15:53,907
If something happens to us...

759
01:15:55,842 --> 01:15:57,811
...I don't want you to think

760
01:15:57,843 --> 01:16:00,279
that I meant
what I said downstairs.

761
01:16:09,088 --> 01:16:11,057
What did I lie about?

762
01:16:12,357 --> 01:16:14,060
Byron?

763
01:16:15,061 --> 01:16:16,196
Oh, honey, I...

764
01:16:16,228 --> 01:16:18,431
You hit him out of nowhere.

765
01:16:18,463 --> 01:16:20,966
I thought it would be
easier for everyone

766
01:16:20,999 --> 01:16:22,468
if I just cut ties.

767
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:26,972
"You took away...

768
01:16:28,507 --> 01:16:31,044
"...friend.

769
01:16:31,076 --> 01:16:33,312
"Now I...

770
01:16:33,346 --> 01:16:35,549
go with..."

771
01:16:38,551 --> 01:16:40,853
No. No, don't...
d-don't go with Larry.

772
01:16:40,887 --> 01:16:42,188
You're right.

773
01:16:42,221 --> 01:16:43,556
I did lie.

774
01:16:43,588 --> 01:16:45,490
And I didn't do it...

775
01:16:45,523 --> 01:16:48,527
Honey, I didn't do it
to protect you.

776
01:16:48,561 --> 01:16:51,598
I did it to protect me.

777
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:54,634
Oliver.

778
01:16:54,667 --> 01:16:58,036
Can you look at me, please?

779
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:00,574
Please, can you look at me?

780
01:17:03,008 --> 01:17:04,576
It's okay.

781
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:06,980
I know you're listening.

782
01:17:07,012 --> 01:17:09,148
You're always listening.

783
01:17:12,551 --> 01:17:15,155
Much more than I listen to you.

784
01:17:31,137 --> 01:17:32,572
Oliver.

785
01:17:43,648 --> 01:17:45,218
Oliver.

786
01:17:46,252 --> 01:17:48,254
Hey.

787
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:28,128
Oliver.

788
01:18:38,404 --> 01:18:41,975
Come...

789
01:18:42,008 --> 01:18:44,511
play.

790
01:19:19,145 --> 01:19:21,481
Friend.

791
01:19:25,151 --> 01:19:28,088
Friend...

792
01:19:40,266 --> 01:19:42,634
F...

793
01:19:42,668 --> 01:19:44,670
F...

794
01:19:47,572 --> 01:19:49,575
F...

795
01:19:51,142 --> 01:19:53,779
F...

796
01:19:53,812 --> 01:19:55,781
Fie-ld.

797
01:19:57,215 --> 01:19:59,485
Field, field, field, field.

798
01:19:59,517 --> 01:20:01,053
Field, field, field,
field, field...

799
01:20:08,259 --> 01:20:10,062
No! No!

800
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:13,532
Oliver!

801
01:20:26,579 --> 01:20:28,447
Field, field, field, field,
field, field, field, field.

802
01:20:28,481 --> 01:20:30,850
Why the field?

803
01:21:38,383 --> 01:21:40,585
There's no electricity here.

804
01:21:40,619 --> 01:21:42,255
He can't get us.

805
01:21:42,288 --> 01:21:43,857
Hey.

806
01:21:57,703 --> 01:21:58,737
Hey.

807
01:21:58,771 --> 01:21:59,871
Oh, you did it.

808
01:21:59,905 --> 01:22:01,641
You did it.

809
01:22:01,673 --> 01:22:02,841
You saved us.

810
01:22:02,874 --> 01:22:04,377
Oh!

811
01:22:31,704 --> 01:22:34,273
Run!

812
01:22:34,306 --> 01:22:35,741
Run! Come on!

813
01:22:35,773 --> 01:22:37,209
Run!

814
01:23:01,566 --> 01:23:03,703
Stop! No, Oliver!

815
01:23:03,736 --> 01:23:05,938
No.

816
01:23:05,971 --> 01:23:07,272
Oliver.

817
01:23:11,442 --> 01:23:13,445
Oliver!

818
01:23:19,884 --> 01:23:21,686
No!

819
01:23:23,955 --> 01:23:25,924
Oliver!

820
01:24:18,043 --> 01:24:21,580
Friends.

821
01:25:14,732 --> 01:25:16,601
I'll be your friend, Larry.

822
01:25:18,669 --> 01:25:21,639
We both want the same thing.

823
01:25:21,673 --> 01:25:24,410
We both want to protect Oliver.

824
01:25:42,527 --> 01:25:44,496
I love you.

825
01:25:45,998 --> 01:25:48,000
I love all of you.

826
01:27:31,069 --> 01:27:32,571
Good.

827
01:27:32,603 --> 01:27:35,007
Now, you want to give it a try?

828
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:38,209
M...

829
01:27:38,243 --> 01:27:40,646
Mom...

830
01:27:40,678 --> 01:27:43,214
"Mom." Excellent.

831
01:27:43,248 --> 01:27:47,620
Loves...

832
01:27:49,288 --> 01:27:51,624
M...

833
01:27:51,656 --> 01:27:54,226
Me.

834
01:27:54,258 --> 01:27:55,694
Wonderful.

835
01:27:55,727 --> 01:27:57,696
"Mom loves me."

836
01:27:57,728 --> 01:28:00,165
I know for a fact
your mom loves you very much.

837
01:28:01,667 --> 01:28:03,134
You're so good with him.

838
01:28:03,168 --> 01:28:05,905
So are you.

839
01:28:05,937 --> 01:28:08,007
How's he doing at home?

840
01:28:09,674 --> 01:28:11,209
He seems okay.

841
01:28:12,678 --> 01:28:14,246
I've been trying to give him

842
01:28:14,279 --> 01:28:16,749
more social experiences,
like you said.

843
01:28:16,781 --> 01:28:18,717
Uh, we've been practicing
his speech,

844
01:28:18,749 --> 01:28:21,085
like, uh, five times a day.

845
01:28:21,119 --> 01:28:23,188
Well, you don't want
to wear him out.

846
01:28:23,221 --> 01:28:25,257
Let's say three times a day.

847
01:28:25,289 --> 01:28:28,192
Oh. Okay.

848
01:28:28,226 --> 01:28:30,295
Got it.

849
01:28:33,065 --> 01:28:35,134
Three times a day.

850
01:28:36,368 --> 01:28:39,737
For speech work.

851
01:28:45,377 --> 01:28:48,246
I mean, you know Sarah...
she was...

852
01:28:50,214 --> 01:28:51,883
...incredible.

853
01:28:54,352 --> 01:28:57,989
I thought I understood, but I...

854
01:29:05,262 --> 01:29:08,299
I just wish I could tell her

855
01:29:08,333 --> 01:29:10,570
that I'm sorry.

856
01:29:12,838 --> 01:29:14,740
That I'm trying now.

857
01:29:16,741 --> 01:29:19,044
I'm sure she'd like
to hear that.

858
01:29:20,646 --> 01:29:22,615
I hope...

859
01:29:22,647 --> 01:29:24,282
they'll find her.

860
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:36,795
Is that you?

861
01:29:44,369 --> 01:29:47,039
- Hey.
- Hey.

862
01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:50,743
Can I, uh...

863
01:29:50,776 --> 01:29:53,245
eat lunch with you guys
tomorrow or something?

864
01:29:53,277 --> 01:29:55,414
That depends.

865
01:29:55,446 --> 01:29:57,815
Are you willing
to take the pledge?

866
01:29:57,848 --> 01:29:59,819
What pledge?

867
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,657
A secret handshake.

868
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:07,759
For those of us
who've seen Larry.

869
01:30:07,793 --> 01:30:10,696
The pledge to stay friends.

870
01:30:10,728 --> 01:30:12,364
To play together forever.

871
01:30:12,396 --> 01:30:16,134
<i>So no one has to be alone
like Larry.</i>

872
01:32:13,317 --> 01:32:15,420
I'll protect you.
