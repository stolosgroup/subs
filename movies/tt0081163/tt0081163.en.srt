Yes, Inspector,
have you found my cabochon ruby?

No, Your Ladyship,
but I have found something else.

13

The identity of Lord Fenley's murderer.

14
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,083
Inspector, you're not trying to imply

15
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,797
that one of us could have actually
performed such a loathsome deed?

16
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:46,543
It's quite ridiculous.
I simply don't believe it.

17
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:52,640
Not only do I believe it, Mr Montrose,
but I have the evidence to prove it.

18
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,185
All of you had sufficient motive.

19
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,272
It could have been... any one of you.

20
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:07,438
You, Sir Derek, have been falsifying
the accounts of Finwick Industries

21
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:11,362
with the help of
your son-in-law Mr Foxwell.

22
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,905
And you were also aware

23
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,906
that Lady Ridgeley
was having an affair with Lord Fenley

24
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:22,878
which ended abruptly
when he resumed his dalliance

25
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,838
with Lady Foxcroft.

26
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:33,465
You see, she had stumbled upon
the knowledge that Barnsby was in truth

27
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,431
Lord Fenley's half brother

28
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:40,931
and the illegitimate father
of Mr Peter Montrose,

29
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,775
who was planning to gain control
of Fenley Industries

30
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,986
with the help of Mr Da Silva,

31
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:51,983
who risked bankruptcy
if the plot failed.

32
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,996
Yes, you all had motives.

33
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,536
Any one of you could have done it.

34
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,415
But only one of you did.

35
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:09,133
A person sitting in this room?
At this very moment?

36
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:14,801
Yes, Miss Kate, in this very room.

37
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,886
This ridiculous cat-and-mouse game
has gone on long enough!

38
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,272
Very well, then.

39
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,942
Lord Fenley's murderer...

<i>[audience groans]</i>

43
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,626
I'll have it fixed in no time,
no time at all.

44
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,966
I'd say that's highly unlikely.

45
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,712
Oh, dear.
Now we'll never know who did it.

46
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:58,636
[woman] It does seem rather obvious
who the murderer was.

47
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:03,183
Who, Miss Marple?
Do tell us. Was it Sir Derek?

48
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,725
I hardly think so, Miss Giles.

49
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,895
It's unlikely he would have
murdered his business partner,

50
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,269
not while he only had
49% of the business,

51
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,815
and the controlling interest

52
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:15,658
would have reverted to Lord Fenley's
sister, a bitter enemy of Sir Derek's.

53
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,072
I'll bet it was
that young blaggard Lord Peter.

54
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,161
Impossible, Major.
Excuse me, dear.

55
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:24,374
The only tracks leading to Lord Fenley's
estate that evening were bicycle tracks.

56
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,913
But he hated Lord Fenley.

57
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,661
Yes, but you forget,

58
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:32,257
young Peter had a birth defect which
caused a malfunction to the inner ear.

59
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,844
This loss of equilibrium in his
system would have made it impossible

60
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,589
for him to maintain his balance
on a bicycle.

61
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,262
[Marple] Good night, Major.

62
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:45,308
Excuse me, Mrs Morley-Smith.
Good night, Dolly.

63
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,520
Good night, Jane.

64
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,936
I still say it was that awful butler.

65
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,731
It was Barnsby,
don't you think, Miss Marple?

66
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:55,026
- I most certainly do not.
- But the revolver in his drawer?

67
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,820
Barnsby had never been
to Lord Fenley's estate'

68
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,943
The footprints
on the night of the murder

69
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,662
led directly to the smaller bedroom
off the left wing

70
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,157
where Lord Fenley
frequently sought privacy.

71
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:09,082
Whoever killed him knew
how to go directly to that room.

72
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:13,753
Well, then who did do it, Miss Marple?
Who murdered Lord Fenley?

73
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,837
Why, young Miss Kate, of course.

74
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,056
Why do you say Miss Kate?

75
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,392
Because when the body
of Lord Fenley was discovered,

76
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,888
the knife was firmly implanted
in the chest to the left.

77
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:31,062
A right-handed person
would have clearly been unable

78
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,810
to strike such a thrust
in that direction.

79
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,654
If you'd looked closely,
you would have noticed

80
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:41,823
Miss Kate was twirling her pearls
in her left hand.

81
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:46,540
Good night, Vicar. I'm sure you'll have
this contraption running in no time'

00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,908

So stop playing around
and give them what they want!

Look, I don't want to argue with you.
I'm the director

a costume fitting up to town.

102
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:49,173
Miss Gregg was particularly anxious
that I should tell you how sorry she is

103
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,549
to have missed you today.

104
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,096
Of course, I quite understand.

105
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:56,267
By the way, what picture
are you over here to make?

106

- It's called Mary Queen of Scots.
- Really? How very interesting.

My dear Miss Zielinsky,

Miss Gregg's arrival has caused
considerable excitement.

It's not every day

I cannot tell you how happy my wife
and I are to be in your house.

Mr Rudd, you must get it out of
your head that this is my house.

120
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:43,193
After the Colonel, my husband, died,
it was much too big for me.

And I'm much more comfortable
down at the lodge'

Well, I really must be on my way.

- No more tea, thank you.

- Very nice to meet you.

00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:56,315
Why, Lola. What a delightful surprise.

307
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,359
You're looking as lovely as always.

308
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,359
Of course,
there are fewer lights on than usual.

309
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:05,202
In fact, any fewer
and I'd need a seeing-eye dog.

310
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:09,620
Oh, I shouldn't bother to buy one, dear.
In that wig you could play Lassie.

311
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,493
Same adorable sense of humour.

312
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:16,293
And I'm so glad to see you not
only kept your gorgeous figure,

313
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,461
but you've added so much to it.

314
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,676
What are you doing here so early, dear?

315
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:24,093
I thought the plastic surgery seminar
was in Switzerland.

316
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:27,638
Actually, darling, I couldn't wait
to begin our little movie.

317
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:28,850
You know the saying,

318
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,517
"Once an actress,
always an actress."

319
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:35,983
Oh, I do know the saying.
But what does it have to do with you?

320
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,478
Cute angel.

321
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:43,950
So do tell, how does it feel
to be back after being away so long?

322
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,992
[Marina] Love your outfit, darling.

323
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,865
Drink, Mrs Babcock?

324
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,334
Mr Rudd is getting me one himself,
thank you.

325
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,124
[Marina] What are you supposed to be,
a birthday cake?

326
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,668
Too bad everybody's had a piece.

327
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:04,011
- Can we have a big smile, ladies?
- Chin up, darling. Both of them.

328
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,130
A little bit closer, please, ladies.

329
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:13,187
Lola, dear, you know there really are
only two things I dislike about you.

330
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,647
Really? What are they?

331
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,984
- Your face.
- Thank you.

332
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:22,731
- One daiquiri special.
- Oh, thank you very much.

333
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:26,200
- I've never really tried one before.
- Enjoy it.

334
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,829
- Here you are, my dear.
- Oh, thank you, darling.

335
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,290
How are my two favourite <i>stars</i>
getting along?

336
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:36,411
What are you trying to do,
give Marina another breakdown?

337
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,004
Why would I want to do
a thing like that, pumpkin?

338
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:42,500
Come on. Remember they used to grind
glass in each other's cold cream.

339
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,423
One would only kiss the other
if she had viral pneumonia.

340
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,297
They're professionals.
They take their job seriously.

341
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:50,766
- So did Attila the Hun.
- Marina, baby!

342
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,806
Oh, Marty, darling.

343
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:56,726
How thoughtful of you
to bring Lola to my party.

344
00:25:56,847 --> 00:26:04,231
You know, I've always thought of Lola
<i>as</i> one of my oldest, oldest friends.

345
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,355
<i>[chuckles]</i>

346
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:09,987
Jason, darling, I'm certainly looking
forward to working under you again.

347
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,531
Watch it, Lola.

348
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,033
Jason, how about a drink
with an old pal'?

349
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:19,207
- I only drink with friends.
- What am I, chopped chicken liver?

350
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,956
Bad enough forcing me
to use your wife in this picture,

351
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,005
but bringing her here with Marina
in the condition she's in.

352
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,672
- Think of the picture!
- I am!

353
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,638
- And the sanity of my leading lady!
- Bubbie, listen to me.

354
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:33,100
She's gonna be fine.
I'm looking out for our best interests.

355
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:35,140
[laughs] Our best interests?

356
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,104
Hey, De Mille,
why don't you face reality?

357
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,270
When was the last time
Marina made a movie?

358
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,937
- The advent of sound?
- [scoffs]

359
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,232
When did you direct a movie
that was any good?

360
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:45,525
- Well...
- Listen to me.

361
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:49,241
If Martin N Fenn wants to get
publicity for his two leading ladies,

362
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:52,282
he's gonna get it,
without any dissent.

363
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,656
Because the esteemed director
and his wife are only here

364
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,124
because of his good wishes.

365
00:26:57,241 --> 00:27:01,337
And if he wishes, he can pull the plug
any time he wants, you got it?

366
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,705
- Whoopee.
- Good.

367
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,208
- So go and enjoy the party.
- You know what?

368
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,005
- What?
- You're a bastard.

369
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,675
Of course I'm a bastard.
I'm the producer.

370
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:13,140
Oh, Mr Rudd. I believe I've reached
some understanding

371
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:16,636
about the difference between
a producer and a director.

372
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,559
But who chooses the leading lady?

373
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,308
Whoever's sleeping with her.

374
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:27,814
Er, Vicar, may I introduce
our noted producer Mr Martin N Penn'?

375
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:31,067
I'm sure he'll tell you
everything you want to know.

376
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,330
What would you like to know,
Vicar, baby?

377
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,666
I'm sorry about your ulcers, Mr Fenn.

378
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,036
What?

379
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:48,960
Jason, we've got a problem upstairs.
That woman.

380
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,131
Marina.

381
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,242
[Cherry] Then the police came.

382
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:25,041
They took everybody's name.
They kept us there for hours, they did.

383
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:28,883
I just couldn't believe it.
I mean, she seemed as right as rain.

384
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:34,347
She was only five years older than me.
There was an awful flap.

385
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:37,262
Poor Mrs Babcock.

386
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:41,103
I mean, she just had one drink
and about five minutes later,

387
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,396
she sits down, sort of gasps...

388
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:48,359
...and then she's dead, poor thing.

389
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,195
What do you think of that?

390
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:53,236
Don't forget under
the curtains, Cherry dear.

391
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,993
- Miss Marple, I hope you don't mind.
- Mind?

392
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:07,914
Well, me doing Saturdays
up at the hall,

393
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:11,258
I did so want to see
all those film stars.

394
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:15,346
- It's not going to upset you?
- No, Cherry dear. It won't upset me.

395
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:18,511
In fact, it might even prove useful.

396
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,009
Really?

397
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:24,058
Put that duster away and sit down
and tell me everything that happened.

398
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,682
- Well...
- Exactly as it happened.

399
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:29,481
Well, I was moving about...

400
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,945
Yes, of course,
but what precisely did you see?

401
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,073
Well...

402
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,694
<i>[Cherry] The whole village was there,</i>
<i>of course.</i>

403
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,242
<i>And there was a girl taking pictures.</i>

404
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:45,413
<i>Just about everybody. There was</i>
<i>Marine Gregg and her husband</i>

405
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,413
<i>Oh, I liked him.
I think he's smashing.</i>

406
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:51,086
<i>- [Miss Marple] Cherry, dear.
- [Cherry] Oh, sorry.</i>

407
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,801
<i>Then the secretery girl came up</i>
<i>with Heather Babcock</i>

408
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,920
<i>and Heather shook hands
with Miss Gregg</i>

409
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:01,095
<i>and then she went into a boring old</i>
<i>story about how they'd met years ago.</i>

410
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:05,847
<i>On and on she went. I thought</i>
<i>Miss Gregg was gonna fall asleep-</i>

411
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,975
Honestly, she did go on, so.

412
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:12,273
Then a few minutes later,
you served Heather a drink

413
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,237
and not long afterwards, she dies.

414
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,574
Oh, no. No, I didn't serve her.

415
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:18,692
<i>It was Mr Rudd.</i>

416
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,491
- One daiquiri special.
- Oh, thank you.

417
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,158
Enjoy it.

418
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,585
<i>[Cherry]
I don't think she really liked it.</i>

419
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:39,130
Thank you, Cherry dear,
you've been very helpful.

420
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,427
- [Cherry] Have I?
- Extremely.

421
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,767
<i>- Oh, good.
- [knocking at door]</i>

422
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,227
Oh, I'll get it.

423
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,447
- [man] Morning, Cherry.
- Morning, Doctor.

424
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,361
Morning, Miss Marple. How's the leg?

425
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:06,207
Good morning, Dr Haydock.
You know, I think it's very much better.

426
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:11,162
Shall I do upstairs now,
or finish here in the lounge?

427
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:15,883
- This is the drawing room, Cherry dear.
- Sorry, drawing room.

428
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,923
- Upstairs, I think.
- Right.

429
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,797
Oh, later on, I'll bring you in
a nice cup of tea.

430
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,896
Poor Heather Babcock.

431
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,066
Mmm.

432
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:42,367
She was a patient of yours, wasn't she?

433
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,078
She was on my list.

434
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:52,290
- Heart trouble?
- Nothing wrong with her heart.

435
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,039
- Which does rather...
- Stick out your tongue.

436
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,006
- Say "aah".
- Aah.

437
00:31:57,124 --> 00:32:00,048
- Put it back.
- Which does rather suggest poison.

438
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:06,012
I think we should leave that
to the coroner, don't you?

439
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,225
Glad to see you started my treatment.

440
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,847
Treatment?

441
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:14,395
Unravelling, aren't I right?

442
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,985
You will have your little joke,
Dr Haydock.

443
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,854
<i>[both chuckle]</i>

444
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:21,823
You can't pull the wool
over my eyes, dear lady.

445
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,615
Look at you. Your cheeks are pink,
your eyes bright.

446
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,113
You're enjoying yourself.
Isn't that so?

447
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:31,993
Dr Haydock, I would be very distressed

448
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:35,496
if I thought you believed
that the only excitement in my life

449
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,840
was predicated on the unfortunate fate
of helpless victims

450
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:42,427
who somehow seem to fall into my path.

451
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:46,299
Upon examination,
the deceased's body was found to contain

452
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,425
massive traces of a barbiturate.

453
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:52,851
Phenobarbital.
Unquestionably the cause of death.

454
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,646
Had she a medical history for which
such a drug could have been prescribed?

455
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,143
Virtually none, sir.

456
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:01,989
Apart from chickenpox as a child
and German measles during the war.

457
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,779
According to her doctor,
she was in excellent health.

458
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,159
Thank you.

459
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,085
Bearing in mind the evidence
we have heard,

460
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:19,799
I have no choice but to record
a verdict of murder by poison

461
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:23,510
at the hand of person
or persons unknown.

462
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,103
- Dermot!
- Hello, Aunt Jane.

463
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,354
My favourite nephew.
What a pleasant surprise.

464
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,727
What are you doing here?

465
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:25,481
- Why, I've come to see you.
- Or to enquire about Heather Babcock.

466
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:29,280
What would a chief inspector from
Scotland Yard be doing in St Mary Mead

467
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,779
if poor Heather
had died of natural causes?

468
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,655
Well, he might have been passing by

469
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,909
and suddenly had a craving
for some of your special peach jam.

470
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:40,503
Now, Dermot, you know very well
I haven't made peach jam

471
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,794
since Taphrina <i>deformans</i>
attacked my Russell reds.

472
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,965
Now come and sit down
and let's have a little chat, shall we?

473
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,882
<i>It was poison, wasn't it?</i>

474
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:55,261
Aunt Jane, you wouldn't mind very much
I suppose if I anyway began

475
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:58,685
- by asking the question, would you?
- [laughs]

476
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,150
The poison was apparently
an American barbiturate,

477
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,770
marketed under the name of Calmadon.

478
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,647
It appears the principal ingredient
of it is...

479
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,274
Phenylethylmalonylurea.

480
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:12,369
I know it from my days
at Bridge Hampton Hospital in the war.

481
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:15,238
Mixed with alcohol,
it causes respiratory depression.

482
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:19,368
A drop in blood pressure.
Feeble heartbeat. Quite deadly, in fact.

483
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:23,088
And you naturally knew the victim,
Babcock?

484
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:27,129
Ooh, yes. Of course.
She was a simple soul. Friendly enough.

485
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,299
A bit of a bore,
but you don't kill someone for that.

486
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,014
If you did,
there'd be no one left in the village.

487
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,350
<i>[laughs]</i>

488
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:39,438
Well! So you're not being
much help, Aunt Jane.

489
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,101
No, I realise that.

490
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,477
So Mrs Babcock refused
your offer of a drink?

491
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:27,228
Yes, she said Mr Rudd
was getting her one. I told you that.

492
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,946
- And Miss Gregg?
- It's funny you should say that.

493
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:32,236
- Funny?
- Well, not funny.

494
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:34,530
Kind of strange, really.

495
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:38,451
Go on, Cherry. Slowly.
Try to remember everything.

496
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:43,748
Well, it... it was a sort of look
on Marina Gregg's face.

497
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:50,046
What kind of a look?
Sad? Angry? Surprised? Frightened?

498
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,509
I don't know.

499
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,550
Cherry, dear, take your time.
Think back.

500
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,550
Try to remember the precise look.

501
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:03,147
Well, it was sort of... frozen.

502
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:06,358
<i>[Cherry] She was staring over
Heather Babcockfis shoulder</i>

503
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,852
<i>like she wasn't listening
to what she was saying.</i>

504
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,024
<i>[Marple] Go on.</i>

505
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:14,150
<i>[Cherry] She was looking towards the
stairs. There's a religious picture.</i>

506
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:17,824
<i>Then Lola Brewster arrived with
her husband, the producer. Funny man.</i>

507
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,992
<i>Wouldn 't be surprised
if he dyes his hair.</i>

508
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:22,582
<i>The girl took a photo.</i>

509
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,451
<i>Heather Babcock was rattling on</i>

510
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:29,047
<i>and Miss Gregg had
this sort of strange frozen look.</i>

511
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:32,418
What specifically was she looking at'?

512
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:35,386
The people? The picture?

513
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,677
- Obviously one of the people.
- Oh, why do you say that?

514
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:42,302
Really, Dermot,
she sees the picture every day.

515
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:45,772
Absolutely. I'm so sorry, Aunt.

516
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:50,895
Er, now, how long did Miss Gregg
remain looking at that picture?

517
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:53,113
<i>The Lady of Shalott.</i>

518
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,321
Aunt Jane?

519
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:58,990
"Out ﬂew the web and ﬂoated wide -
The mirror crack'd from side to side;

520
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,785
'The curse has come upon me,' cried
The Lady of Shalott."

521
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:08,041
Tennyson, of course.
I do have a weakness for Tennyson.

522
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,835
And it does seem a rather
suitable description.

523
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,378
Go on, Cherry dear.
Continue with your story.

524
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,886
Nothing much more to tell, really.
Lola Brewster came up to Miss Gregg.

525
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,680
I don't think they like each other much,
if you ask me.

526
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:26,977
They had some pictures taken
and then Mr Rudd came up.

527
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,348
He's so handsome.

528
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:32,273
Cherry, we want to hear about
Miss Babcock and Miss Gregg.

529
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,895
Did anything else happen?

530
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,739
No, I don't think
I've left anything out.

531
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,484
Heather spilled her drink
and Miss Gregg walked away.

532
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:43,864
Spilled?
You say Heather spilled her drink?

533
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:48,368
Oh, yeah. Oh, didn't I say that?
Oh, I must have forgot.

534
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,211
<i>[Cherry]</i> I <i>am silly, aren't I?</i>

535
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:54,003
- Oh, Miss Gregg! I'm so terribly sorry.
- It's perfectly alright.

536
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,467
- Oh, will it stain?
- I'm sure not, I'm sure not.

537
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,838
Here, you take mine,
I haven't touched it.

538
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:00,964
Oh, no. I couldn't.

539
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:04,514
Please, it's no problem.
I'll get another.

540
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,490
So...

541
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:29,079
...Heather Babcock drank
from Marina Gregg's glass.

542
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:36,003
Fate was rather unkind
to poor Heather Babcock.

543
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,798
Seems we've been dealing
with the wrong murder.

544
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:43,264
I suggest you proceed to Gossington Hall
first thing in the morning.

545
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:47,852
To put to use all those cunning skills
I've inherited from a certain relative?

546
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:53,434
You know, Dermot,
you really are my favourite nephew.

547
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,781
I'll let Mr Rudd know you are here, sir.

548
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,666
- Inspector Craddock?
- Yes.

549
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,174
Mr Rudd will be with you
<i>as</i> soon as he can,

550
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:24,389
but I must warn you,
he's awfully tied up.

551
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,506
Tied up?

552
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:30,103
Inspector, have you any idea
what making a movie entails?

553
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:33,063
We have wardrobe tests,
we have make-up tests,

554
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,353
we have lighting tests.

555
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:37,774
<i>- Rainbows End.
- I beg your pardon?</i>

556
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:42,821
Yes, it was Marina Gregg's
first Academy Award, wasn't it?

557
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:46,195
- Yes.
- I'll never forget that last scene.

558
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,492
So vivid, real.

559
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:52,493
Vulnerability, Miss Zielinsky.
Her <i>modus</i> operandi

560
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:57,874
<i>Journey Home, Paradise Road.
Absolute conviction.</i>

561
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:01,467
This indestructible ability
to make us care.

562
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:06,924
- Now, they were facing this way.
- Inspector?

563
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:10,177
[Craddock] I'm sorry.
The guests when they were introduced.

564
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,348
Yes, that's right.

565
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:19,106
Those eyes.
Violent. Mesmerising.

566
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,774
It's a copy, of course.

567
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,445
No, no.
I was referring to Miss Gregg's eyes.

568
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:28,536
Yes, my earliest memory of those eyes
was in Tomorrowfis <i>Dawn.</i>

569
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:32,078
She played a young socialite
heiress who came from...

570
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:35,202
Now, where was it she came from?

571
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,999
- Boston.
- Boston, that's right!

572
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,999
She came from Boston
and inherited land in California.

573
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:41,170
<i>Do you mind...?</i>

574
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:45,090
Do you remember that scene where
they threatened to dig up her land?

575
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,634
The way she stood up to
those gold-miners,

576
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:51,885
that sweet, helpless young butterfly.

577
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,855
Tell me, might I speak to her, please?

578
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:59,351
- I'm sorry, she's resting.
- Oh.

579
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:03,480
- Well, perhaps later?
- Perhaps.

580
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:07,029
But sweet, helpless young butterflies
do need their rest.

581
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,655
That snake-eyed son of a bitch,
Marty Fenn!

582
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,282
He always did have the class of a toad!

583
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:17,627
And he's putting up the money
for your comeback, so calm down.

584
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:21,920
And putting that peroxide ﬂoozy
into my film!

585
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,293
And <i>as</i> the virgin queen!

586
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:27,967
She's in two lousy scenes,
neither of them with you'

587
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:31,136
Lola Brewster, actress.

588
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:34,887
If she's read the script,
I'd see a blister on her finger.

589
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:38,732
It's your picture all the way. Nobody
will remember anyone else in it.

590
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,569
Oh, Jinksy.

591
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:47,316
- Do you really mean that?
- I'll make sure of it.

592
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,660
Oh, God. God, it has been so long.

593
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:55,499
You don't think there's
any chance I have lost it, do you?

594
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:59,119
Oh, you'll be better than ever.
I promise.

595
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,585
My love. You're so good for me.

596
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,635
You always have been.

597
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:14,760
Oh, damn her! That bitch!
If you look at her carefully,

598
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:19,390
there's so many lines on her face,
you could drive a train on it!

599
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,482
Maybe I won't shoot her
through a filter.

600
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,070
- Filter? Try using an Indian blanket.
- [chuckles]

601
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,155
You're gonna have to
dub her voice in too.

602
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:34,029
Or write a line in the script that
Elizabeth is from Hoboken, New Jersey.

603
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,201
<i>[sighs]</i>

604
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:42,378
Bags, bags, go away-

<i>[phone rings]</i>

607
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,719
<i>- Hello?
- [Marty] Jason, where the hell are you?</i>

608
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,185
Lola's been sitting here for 20 minutes
waiting for you.

609
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,271
She likes the feathers so much,
she wants them in the costume.

610
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:03,517
I told her, a queen only wears feathers
if he lives in Hollywood,

611
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,234
but she won't believe me.

612
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:08,571
<i>Jason, you get your ass over here!</i>

613
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:11,862
- I've been thinking, poopsie.
- Oh, that's a new experience!

614
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:15,032
Maybe we should bring in Alexander
for my hair.

615
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:18,999
Lamb chop, if I've told you once,
I've told you a thousand times:

616
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:21,459
Queen Elizabeth was bald.

617
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,920
- Not in this movie, she ain't.
- It's history.

618
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:28,792
So is Lola Brewster.
I'll be majestic.

619
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:33,092
Awesome. Inspiring.

620
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,509
<i>[chuckles]</i>

621
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,760
I'm going to wipe that cow
right off the screen'

622
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:42,480
Let's see, we're gonna need
some scenes with the two of us together,

623
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:47,319
so the world can see
how much younger and thinner I am.

624
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:50,735
Lola, baby.
Elizabeth and Mary never met.

625
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,903
Oh, maybe they meet at the market.

626
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:56,073
[chuckles] No, of course not,
she'd never do her own shopping.

627
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:59,664
The beauty parlour?
No, they'd come to her.

628
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,830
Wait a minute.

629
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,329
I've got it.

630
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:09,833
I come to see her
at the Tower of London.

631
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:16,590
It's right before the beheading
and the rats are crawling all over her.

632
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,809
She's in rags, looking like shit.

633
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:23,806
And in walks... me.

634
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:37,285
- Inspector, I do have things to do.
- Yes, of course.

635
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,904
Miss Gregg and Miss Brewster,
are they very close?

636
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:41,030
Close?

637
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:44,250
If you put the two of them together
in a tank with a shark,

638
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:46,711
the shark would have an identity crisis.

639
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:50,172
Tell me, I'm curious, who's younger?
Marina Gregg or Lola Brewster?

640
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,087
- Neither one. [sneezes]
- Bless you.

641
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,755
<i>Oh. [sniffles]</i>

642
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,002
<i>[sneezes]</i>

643
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:57,095
- You alright?
- Hay fever.

644
00:45:57,213 --> 00:46:01,343
Those are maddening things, allergies.
I'm allergic to wool.

645
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:05,222
I find a tranquiliser helps me.
I use a drug called Calmadon.

646
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,599
- Do you know of it?
- We ship it in by the barrel.

647
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,317
Oh. Does Miss Gregg take it?

648
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,526
By the time this movie's over,
there may be a world shortage.

649
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:17,275
- Do you take it?
- Do I have a choice?

650
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:23,577
Ah, I think it must be very exciting
working for someone like Marina Gregg.

651
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:25,871
I'm sure she's a grand person.

652
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:30,418
Inspector, Marina Gregg can make
Medusa look like St Bernadette.

653
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:34,918
- Why don't you change your job?
- What, and quit show business?

654
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,465
I used to work for Jason
before they were married.

655
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:40,465
I've learned to live with her tantrums
and her breakdowns.

656
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:45,095
Breakdowns? But the image she projects
on the screen is so rational.

657
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,892
Tell me about them.

658
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:49,562
- It's all rather turgid.
- Really, I'm fascinated.

659
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:53,357
Well, you can't mention illness
or insanity

660
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,730
or anything to do with children.

661
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:59,530
That's most interesting. Why not'?

662
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,073
Inspector, I really can't go into it.

663
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:10,165
I'm sure that Mr Rudd
is a tower of strength to her.

664
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:14,883
- Devoted beyond the call of duty.
- And Mr Penn?

665
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:17,843
Marty Fenn is a producer.
He only lies when he speaks.

666
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,462
<i>[chuckles]</i>

667
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:22,591
I should think they've been
pretty unsettled by the murder?

668
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:26,436
Murder?
Inspector, we have a picture to make.

669
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:29,271
We can't be bothered
by little local difficulties.

670
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,436
<i>[door opens]</i>

671
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:34,231
Ah, Mr Rudd.
Could I ask you a few questions?

672
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:37,526
I'm in a rush. Talk to my secretary,
she'll arrange an interview.

673
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,694
[Craddack] But I'm not a reporter.

674
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,443
- <i>[phone rings]</i>
- Mr Rudd.

675
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:49,250
Yes? Tell him I'm on my way, damn it.
Ten minutes!

676
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:50,914
- Mr Rudd.
- I told you, not now.

677
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:53,754
I'm Inspector Craddock,
Scotland Yard.

678
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,543
Everything we're doing
is according to form.

679
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:01,716
British crew, extras.
I've waivers on my two leading ladies.

680
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,716
- We're in total compliance.
- If I might interrupt you.

681
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,184
I'm sure you're going to make
a very fine picture

682
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,928
without the aid of Scotland Yard.

683
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:12,603
I happen to be here
on a minor matter of murder.

684
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,476
<i>[Rudd] Oh, yes. Er, Miss...</i>

685
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,228
Babcock, Heather Babcock.

686
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:23,617
- I'm truly sorry.
- If I might talk to your wife?

687
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:27,409
I'm sorry, no one may see her.
She's resting' Doctor's orders.

688
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:28,747
If you'll excuse me.

689
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:32,414
Mr Rudd, it's very important
that I talk to her.

690
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:37,336
Inspector, my wife is about to start
the most important role of her career.

691
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:40,756
Every ounce of energy is being
devoted toward preparing this role.

692
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,095
She is going to win
her third Academy Award

693
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:45,431
and I will not distract her with...

694
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:48,142
Mundane matters like murder.

695
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:51,559
- Whatever you say, Inspector.
- Jinks.

696
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,773
[Craddock]
That's all very well and good.

697
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:57,189
I firmly believe your wife
deserves a third Oscar.

698
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,153
I think she should have got it
for Summer Rain, actually'

699
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:02,990
But has it occurred to you
the death of Heather Babcock

700
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:04,984
wasn't entirely accidental'?

701
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,908
That the intended victim
was, in fact, your wife?

702
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,873
Now may I see her, please?

703
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:17,747
No, you may not.

704
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:22,628
My wife has been through a lot and I'm
not only talking about last Saturday.

705
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:26,301
I'm sorry, but you're not going
to give her a nervous breakdown.

706
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:29,471
Now, if you will excuse me.

707
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:32,391
[Craddock] I believe
she's had several all ready.

708
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:35,435
- [Rudd] Several what?
- Breakdowns.

709
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:38,435
- [Rudd] Who told you?
- I thought it was common knowledge.

710
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:42,112
Ah, it's nice of you
to let them play here.

711
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:45,073
What? Oh, the gardener's kids.

712
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:48,411
I thought they might
have upset Miss Gregg.

713
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:51,781
Alright, Inspector,
let's stop playing games.

714
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:57,708
There was a time years ago
when Marina wanted children, badly.

715
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,206
The doctors told her
she could never have any,

716
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,800
so she adopted two.

717
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:06,888
Then a few years later... She was
still married to her first husband.

718
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:11,635
She found out she was actually
going to have one of her own.

719
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:17,061
Unfortunately, the child
was born mentally retarded. An imbecile.

720
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:20,902
Marina had a complete breakdown.
She hasn't worked since.

721
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,270
I see.

722
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:26,615
Now maybe you can understand
what this film means to her.

723
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:30,282
That she actually has the guts to
appear in front of a camera again.

724
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,325
Yes, indeed.

725
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,495
This film's gonna turn
everything around for her.

726
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:40,125
That's why if she ever found out,
even suspected,

727
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:41,748
she was the intended victim...

728
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,466
You don't believe the thought
has entered her mind?

729
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,590
Not for a minute.

730
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:53,225
The idea of someone wanting to murder
your wife doesn't bother you?

731
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:56,846
You've been seeing too many
Charlie Chan movies, Inspector.

732
00:50:56,971 --> 00:51:00,851
Look, I'll be here the whole time.

733
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:03,774
When I'm not, my secretary
won't let her out of her sight.

734
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,363
- You trust Miss Zielinsky?
- Of course I trust her.

735
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,824
She was there.
She had the opportunity.

736
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:12,616
- Ella is devoted to my wife.
- And to you too?

737
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,330
Jason, Marty phoned again!

738
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:19,543
He said if you're not there in
ten minutes, he's getting John Houston!

739
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,965
Will there be anything else, Inspector?

740
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:32,306
<i>Is that the Martin N Fenn
who produced the Terror in Trinidad?</i>

741
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:34,221
The one and only.

742
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,390
I've always wondered
what the N stood for.

743
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,138
No idea.

744
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,142
How about "knockwurst"?

745
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:47,898
- [chuckles] Oh, Mr Rudd.
- What?

746
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:51,026
<i>I was really most impressed
with The Last Brigade.</i>

747
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,993
Particularly, if I may say so,

748
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,410
with your very subtle use
of low-key lighting.

749
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:59,875
Why, thank you.

750
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:23,190
Shouldn't you be resting that foot,
Aunt Jane?

751
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:25,275
Old Edward's got his rheumatism again.

752
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,896
I really can't let the garden
become like a jungle

753
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:31,240
Do you think Mr Rudd
is fond of his wife?

754
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:35,157
- I'd say he adores her.
- What about Miss Zielinsky?

755
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:38,747
Business-like. Efficient.
Seemingly loyal.

756
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,537
Suffers from hay fever.

757
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:43,912
- Attractive?
- Yes, in a uncalculated sort of way.

758
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:48,291
- That's a very austere assessment.
- Maybe, but what are you implying?

759
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,088
I'm implying absolutely nothing.

760
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:53,679
I just find your lack of emotion,
shall we say, a bit studied.

761
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:56,800
Oh, alright.
If you prefer I were more direct,

762
00:52:56,924 --> 00:53:00,019
then I'd say that given the right time,
the right place,

763
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:04,265
that Miss Zielinsky is probably...
hotter than a pistol.

764
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:07,519
Hmm, perhaps
we should return to austerity.

765
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:10,271
- Well, you brought it up.
- [laughs]

766
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:13,741
Seriously, do you believe
she was telling the truth?

767
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:17,907
Well, let's say, I think she allowed her
loyalties to become quite transparent'

768
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,577
- Her feelings for Mr Rudd.
- Exactly.

769
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:25,545
- A prime suspect, I'd say.
- Oh, would you, now? Well, well.

770
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:26,833
Where are you off to?

771
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:30,174
I'm off to the glamorous world
of movie making.

772
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:34,921
I see this is not a particularly
taxing case for you, Dermot.

<i>Show business is just
a business, Aunt Jane.</i>

774
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:41,514
What we need is a little more business
and a little <i>less</i> show.

775
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:45,435
In fact, there's a wonderful saying
I read not too long ago about Hollywood.

776
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:49,606
"Underneath all that phoney tinsel
lies the real tinsel."

777
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:54,153
- That's very profound, Aunt Jane.
- Better be careful, Dermot.

778
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:58,244
They're liable to mistake you for Leslie
Howard and put you in the picture.

779
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,705
Well, I do have a certain charm,
or so I've been told.

780
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,870
Perhaps it's time
it was discovered.

781
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:08,417
Dermot! First discover
Heather Babcock's murderer.

782
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:12,383
Well, I'd better work fast
before someone else does it for me.

an actress in this movie,

one who also happens
to be married to the producer.

812

No, I haven't forgotten.

813
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:14,205
I think it's important we discuss the
queen's relationship with her father.

814
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:17,378
When the picture begins,
the father's been dead over 30 years.

Why don't you go to your dressing room

I told Marty we should
have got George Cukor.

817
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:27,179
Swords and blood,
that's all he thinks about.

818

Did you see his last picture?

821

I could eat a can of Kodak
and puke a better movie.

822

Oh, why, you must be Inspector Craddock.

823
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:51,959
They told me you'd be here.
How sweet of you to come.

824
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,248
Miss Brewster,
I'm a great fan of yours.

825
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,916
Isn't that nice?

826
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:58,712
And I now you'll excuse me
while I change.

827
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:03,258
Yes. Yes, of course.
Please, you carry on.

828
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:09,761
Now, tell me, Inspector dear,
what's on your mind?

829
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:15,816
I have a few questions regarding
the murder of Heather Babcock.

830
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:19,187
- Who?
- The woman up at Gossington Hall.

831
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:21,564
Oh, yes. Who was she, an extra?

832
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,612
Ow! The zipper, you moron.
It's caught in my rump!

833
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:25,985
I'm sorry, Miss Brewster.

834
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:30,114
If I might digress for a moment.
I'd <i>like...</i> Oh, so sorry.

835

...to erm, ask about your relationship
with Marina Gregg.

836
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,663
Gregg? Gregg, that name rings a bell.

837
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:41,133
- Come now, Miss Brewster.
- I'm just teasing you, Sherlock.

838
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:43,126
Of course I know Marina Gregg.

839
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:46,255
Isn't she that aging,
broken-down ex-star

840
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,633
trying so desperately for a comeback?

841
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:52,261
Here, try combing this out;
they may find Amelia Earhart.

842
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:54,855
Now, tell me, Inspector dear,

843
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:58,693
why don't you ask me
some more of those searching questions?

844
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:04,191
I just love being examined,
especially by someone as cute <i>as</i> you.

Erm, what I'm particularly...

846

Are you really from Scotland Yard?
A real-life Inspector?

847
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,198
I can just hardly believe it.

848
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,997
A real-life Inspector
in my dressing room.

849
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:21,090
Oh, just think of me as a...

853
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,850
Forgive me,

854
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:38,440
Now, about Marina.

855
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:43,859
Well, what can I say?
She was a great star. Was.

856
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:46,573
I mean, when I was just
a teensy-weensy little girl,

857
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:50,445
my grandmother used to take me
to see all of her movies.

858
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:54,790
And then about ten years ago,
around my 16th birthday,

859
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:57,250
she had this awful collapse, poor thing.

860
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:00,792
Drugs, alcohol, insanity.

861
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:03,461
It's not easy
when you've hit rock bottom.

862
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:07,758
Marty and I felt the least we could do
was to give her a part in my picture.

863
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:13,430
- Yes, that's very charitable.
- Ow, not so tight.

864
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:17,930
- Erm, Miss Brewster?
- Inspector?

865
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:21,025
Wasn't there some kind of trouble
between you and Miss Gregg

866
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:25,066
- a few years ago?
- Trouble? [laughs] Why...

867
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:27,030
Whatever do you mean?

868
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:30,447
When Miss Gregg began seeing Mr Rudd,
weren't you and Mr Rudd...

869
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,912
Now, Inspector.
That's ancient history.

870
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:37,579
Besides, Jason and I
were ending it anyway.

871
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:43,047
I was only too happy to see
Marina find a little companionship,

872
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:46,042
lonely and pathetic creature
that she was.

873
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:52,094
Is that why you aimed and fired
a short-barrel 9mm Luger at her skull

874
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:53,887
missing it by two and a half inches?

875
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,760
- Did the bitch tell you that?
- No, Miss Brewster.

Alright, so I got a little miffed.

I may be a great star,
but I'm still human.

879

Human enough to try it again?
Only this time with poison?

They all live up there somewhere.

I knew a broad once.
I was making a Civil War epic.

909
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:56,531
We were supposed to shoot
a big scene that day.

910
01:02:56,648 --> 01:03:01,870
She comes to me and tells me
she can't work that week. Know why?

911
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:08,541
Because her astrologist...
tells her it's not in the stars.

912
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:13,882
So, I, er,
pay this little creep a visit.

913
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:16,923
I give him a grand, right?

914
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:20,843
[laughs] He tells her the stars
have made a sudden shift

915
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:24,343
and if she doesn't report to work
every morning on time,

916
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,640
she's gonna lose her sex drive.

917
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,230
The next morning
she was there before the janitor.

918

Won't you sit down?

919
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:34,903
- Yes, <i>fields of Glory,</i> wasn't it?
- Yeah, did you see that?

920
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:38,320
Yes, I found it a bit melodramatic.
It's not a very positive...

921

The only thing positive thing 
about it was the negative.

Now I'm slowly becoming an addict.

Well, there's a little shop
in the village, Hedgeworth,

01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:47,151
offers an extraordinary selection.
The most exotic brews.

You're probably thinking
how hopelessly American she sounds.

You're here about that poor woman,
aren't you?

993
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:08,214
Who would want to kill her'?
Do you have a clue?

994
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,678
Can you tell me about her'?

How would I know anything about her?

997
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:19,771

spent some time talking together.

998
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:25,485
Ah, well, she spent time talking,
I spent time listening.

999
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:28,355
Can you be more specific, Miss Gregg?

1000
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:35,287
Do you know what fans are like,
Inspector? I mean, real fans.

No. Why don't you tell me'?

1002

Well, it seems...

1003
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,753
Let me think,
I want to get this straight.

1004
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:53,472
It seems we had met once,
years ago during the war.

1005
01:08:53,588 --> 01:08:55,761
She remembered every detail of it,

1006
01:08:55,882 --> 01:09:00,183
even down to the song I was singing,
the dress I was wearing.

1007
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:05,892
Funny thing is, I remember it too.

1008
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:10,113
Anyway, I was entertaining the troops
and she was sick or something,

1009
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:12,778
but she was determined to see me.

1010
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:17,905
And she got out of bed, got dressed,
got into the stage door.

1011
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:21,158
Her uncle or someone
was the door keeper.

1012
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:25,253
And she waited in the wings
until after my curtain call,

1013
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:30,001
and I signed her autograph or something.

1014
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:35,847
She said it was
the most exciting night of her life.

1015
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:41,602
And you know, it probably was.

1016
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,561
I'm so sorry. Erm, yes.

1017
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:55,113
I understand there was a moment when
you seemed startled about something

1018
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:57,952
or maybe even frightened.

1019
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:00,029
Frightened?

1020
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:03,624
It was about the time when
Mr Fenn and his wife appeared.

1021
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,664
You looked at a picture on the landing.

1022
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:10,873
Oh, that.

1023
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:15,094
Yes, of course.
There... There was a moment.

1024
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,714
I was talking to that woman,
that fan,

1025
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:20,888
and she was going on and on,
gushing.

1026
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:23,136
I was feeling run out of thank yous

1027
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:30,145
and I just didn't know how to get
out of it and <i>I...</i> just went blank.

1028
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:32,817
Miss Gregg,
I hope you won't find this upsetting

1029
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:37,909
but can you think of anyone
who might want to kill you?

1030
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:45,242
- Why do you ask that?
- I must explore every possibility.

1031
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:49,921
How do you get along
with Miss Zielinsky?

1032
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:52,836
Why are you asking these questions?

1033
01:10:54,250 --> 01:11:00,007
A local woman was murdered.
What does it have to do with me?

1034
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:02,975

I came here with friends.
I came here with people that love me.

1036

Why are you doing this to me? Why?

1037
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:14,820

They'll stand up for me'

01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:32,683
- Oh, at least twice.
- [chuckles]

1058
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:34,150
That one was a real dog.

1059
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:37,362
But you were most compelling
in that scene, though

1060
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:39,901
The critics didn't seem to think so.

1061
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:41,399
If they'd been here today,

1062
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:44,277
I'm absolutely certain
they would have succumbed.

1063
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:48,155
You didn't.

1064
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:51,750
Well, I'm a detective, Miss Gregg.

1065
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:55,589
It's my job to analyse behaviour
off screen.

1066
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:59,425
Well, I'm an actress. I act.

1067
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:04,764
Yes, I think the performance
was a little overdone, if I may say.

1068
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:07,304
I would have settled
for simple sincerity.

1069
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:14,182
I didn't think you'd believe me.

1070
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:18,944
I still don't think you believe me.

1071
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:41,668
"You won't escape next time."

1072
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:43,965
"Prepare to die."

1073
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:47,056
One came here,
the other was sent to the studio.

1074
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:49,767
- When?
- This morning.

1075
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:51,852
- Who delivered them?
- We don't know.

1076
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:55,439
- We?
- My husband and I.

1077
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:58,560
At first I thought it was a joke.

1078
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:01,778
Some kind of joke, huh?

1079
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:13,833
I don't think I've been so scared
since I was a kid in Oklahoma City.

1080
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:21,670
Shirley Bookbinder.
Prettiest little girl in town.

1081
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:25,887
I really thought I was something.

1082
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:33,641
Till one day I found...
I think I was around ten.

1083
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:38,483
I found in my desk a note saying...

1084
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:44,321
"Nobody likes you, Shirley."

1085
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:49,493
I cried for three days.

1086
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,791
I never did find out who wrote it.

1087
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:05,551
See, the tough thing about having it,

1088
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:09,423
there's always somebody
who wants to take it away.

1089
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:16,896
And you know, they usually do.

1090
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:25,237
Help me, Inspector, please.

1091
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:32,078
- And I'm sure you will, Dermot.
- Well, I'll certainly try.

1092
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:35,824
I suspect you're rather smitten
with Miss Bookbinder.

1093
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:37,871
Nonsense, Aunt Jane.

1094
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:40,498
Trouble is, of course,

1095
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:44,374
I now have enough suspects
with enough motives

1096
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:46,967
to fill every shop in this high street.

1097
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:51,305
Please make sure that you
and little Jeremy John

1098
01:15:51,422 --> 01:15:54,016
and the godparents are on time,

1099
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:58,559
because at 3:30 I have Mrs Cracknell
and her little Jeremy John.

1100
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:03,355
No, no, that's wrong. Mrs Cracknell's
little Michael Jeremy John.

1101
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:05,979
No, that's wrong too.
Mrs Michael's John.

1102
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:08,526
No, that's not right either.

1103
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:13,278
So confusing.
But I must get it right, mustn't I?

1104
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:16,702
Well, see you Saturday, 3:30.

1105
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:21,794
Ah, Miss Marple! Great news!

1106
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:27,338
Mr Edwards down at the garage
has been able to diagnose the problem.

1107
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:31,179
We shall, therefore, hopefully no longer
have to call upon you

1108
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:35,801
to resolve next Friday night's
little extravaganza, Two <i>Girls</i> from...

1109
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:39,270
I've forgotten where.
But I do hope to see you anyway.

1110
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:41,138
Somewhere in America I'm sure.

1111
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:44,688
Idaho. You can safely
give that one a miss, Aunt Jane.

1112
01:16:44,809 --> 01:16:46,777
[Miss Marple] If you say so, Dermot.

1113
01:16:50,022 --> 01:16:52,070
Jamie.

1114
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:54,740
Oh, Jamie.

1115
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:58,952
How I've longed for you.

1116
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:04,955
To take you in my arms
and to clasp you to my bosom.

1117
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:10,509
Jason, will you get that creep
out of my eye line?

1118
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,254
- Cut.
- Who? Who, me?

1119
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:15,347
Was I in your eye line?

1120
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:19,264
Oh, but I just wanted Jason
to see my costume.

1121
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:23,686
Dear, will you put the virgin queen
back into her cage?

1122
01:17:23,806 --> 01:17:27,936
Lola, why don't you go study your lines?

1123
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,939
Anything you say.

1124
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:33,942
Anybody got a script breakdown?

1125
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:37,320
Oh, I am so sorry.

1126
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:39,993
I shouldn't have used that word.

1127
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:50,006
<i>- Tee's up!
- [bell rings]</i>

1128
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:51,967
Don't all rush. Plenty to go round.

1129
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:55,964
Don't walk in front of the camera,
for goodness' sake! Load of animals.

1130
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,053
Are you OK?

1131
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:03,266
Hmm?

1132
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:07,774
I'm fine, Jinks.

1133
01:18:09,476 --> 01:18:10,773
That's my girl.

1134
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:13,114
Excuse me.

1135
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:17,785
- Coffee, Marina.
- Oh, thank you.

1136
01:18:17,902 --> 01:18:19,324
Jason, shall I get you a cup?

1137
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:23,200
Could you come and look at this?
See if you can strike it? Thanks'

1138
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,162
Thank you.

1139
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:35,928
Jason, when do I get to play
my scene with Sir Walter Raleigh?

1140
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:38,844
- What?
- Jason! Jason!

1141
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:43,428
- What is it?
- The...

1142
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:46,601
The coffee.

1143
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:54,443
There's nothing wrong with it,
it's just a little strong.

1144
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,110
- You're lying.
- Honey, come on.

1145
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:59,031
You're lying! It's poisoned!

1146
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:19,089
[Cherry] I'll see you in the morning,
Miss Marple. I've laid everything out.

1147
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:21,887
And don't forget,
I left your dinner in the oven.

1148
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,884
[Miss Marple] Thank you, Cherry dear.

01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,427
I saw you, murderer.

I've been out for a walk.

1158
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:53,557
What's the matter with you?
You look terrible.

1159
01:20:56,477 --> 01:21:01,654
The coffee Marina
almost drank on the set.

1160
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,026
I had it analysed.

1161
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:07,450
- Arsenic.
- Arsenic?

1162
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:11,909
- How?
- I'm asking you.

1163
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:14,913
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You made it, you poured it.

1164
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:18,883
- You gave it to her.
- Do you think I tried to poison her?

1165
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:21,127
Yes!

1166
01:21:21,251 --> 01:21:23,345
No. I don't know.

1167
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:26,591
I don't know what to think.

1168
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:36,267
You really do love her,
don't you, Jason?

1169
01:21:41,772 --> 01:21:44,241
Don't worry, I'm sure they'll find him.

1170
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:49,580
- Him?
- Whoever did it.

Mr Rudd called the station at 8:55, sir.

1176

You'll have my report in the morning.

Alright, girls, you can go now.

1178
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:25,134
Bates, if you'll stay, Constable Arnold
will take your statement now.

1179
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:36,763
Inspector, who would want to kill her?

1180
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:40,645
The same person
that tried to poison your wife.

1181
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:47,069
Did you know that Miss Zielinsky
was making a series of phone calls

1182
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:49,283
from the box in the village?

1183
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:55,202
She was apparently playing detectives.
Phoning every suspect.

1184
01:23:55,322 --> 01:23:58,292
Telling them that she'd seen them
poison Miss Gregg.

1185
01:23:58,408 --> 01:24:00,502
Waiting for a reaction.

1186
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:05,967
If whoever she was talking to had
took the bait, she'd find the murderer.

1187
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:09,174
She obviously did.

1188
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:18,812
You've seen the coffee analysis?

1189
01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:24,732
Yes. Mr Rudd, why didn't you
tell me about these notes?

1190
01:24:31,858 --> 01:24:34,111
I obviously forgot about them.

1191
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:39,450
Somebody threatened to kill your wife
and you forgot?

1192
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:46,083
- I thought I could handle it.
- Not very effectively, it seems.

1193
01:24:58,218 --> 01:25:00,346
What are you doing?

1194
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:03,314
- I'm getting out of here.
- Marina.

1195
01:25:03,432 --> 01:25:06,561
I'm sorry, Jason,
but I'm not staying here another night.

1196
01:25:06,685 --> 01:25:09,438
- What about the picture?
- To hell with the picture!

1197
01:25:09,563 --> 01:25:11,861
Somebody out there
is trying to kill me.

1198
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:15,737
- Think I'm gonna sit and wait for them?
- No one is going to hurt you.

1199
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:23,248
- Oh, Jinks. I'm so scared!
- I know, I know.

1200
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:26,872
But I'm here with you.
The police are on guard.

1201
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:30,547
Why? Why would somebody
want to hurt me?

1202
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:32,761
Shh.

1203
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,633
Why didn't you tell me
about those notes?

1204
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:44,477
What's the point?
Scare the hell out of you too?

1205
01:25:44,598 --> 01:25:46,271
Please, let's get out of here.

1206
01:25:48,769 --> 01:25:53,115
OK, we'll check into a hotel
in the morning.

1207
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:57,111
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

1208
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:59,283
And we'll be together always.

1209
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:02,078
Till death do us part.

1210
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:04,076
Why'd you say that?

1211
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:10,625
Seems we can eliminate
Miss Zielinsky as a suspect.

1212
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:13,127
Murder is a very dangerous business.

1213
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:18,052
If one gets mixed up in it, one must
be prepared for the consequences.

1214
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,267
She wasn't a pretty sight.

1215
01:26:20,384 --> 01:26:23,809
Prussic acid
is a most unpleasant death.

1216
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:28,145
So, where do we go from here, Aunt Jane?

1217
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:31,236
Our most likely suspecfs
become our latest victim.

1218
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:34,106
Do you realise there were
at least 40 people at that party

1219
01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:36,905
and no one saw the poison
being put into the glass?

1220
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:40,746
Come now, Dermot. At least three people
could have quite easily.

1221
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:44,207
One, the unobservant soul
preoccupied with other thoughts,

1222
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:47,043
- completely unaware of what he saw.
- Hmm, second?

1223
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,834
The person who may have seen it
and thought nothing of it

1224
01:26:49,955 --> 01:26:51,582
because it seemed quite natural.

1225
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:53,801
In my day,
it was considered bad manners,

1226
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:56,841
but people today are always
putting things in their drinks.

1227
01:26:56,962 --> 01:27:00,808
- Pills, medicine. All sorts of things.
- I suppose. And third?

1228
01:27:00,924 --> 01:27:03,473
We have the person
who actually did it.

1229
01:27:03,593 --> 01:27:05,812
The same person
who murdered Ella Zielinsky.

1230
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:11,106
Exactly. You know, Dermot, I always
think that murder is like a jigsaw.

1231
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:15,823
Until you've fitted in the final piece,
you can't see the whole picture.

1232
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:19,364
Obviously,
we still have a piece missing.

1233
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:31,540
Now, what was that awful women's name?
Brown boots, sort of Cheltenham type.

1234
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:34,291
- Colethorpe.
- Cynthia Colethorpe, right.

1235
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:37,636
And I distinctly remember it
wasn't till halfway through the case

1236
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:40,597
when you reminded me about
her smelly little Pekingese.

1237
01:27:40,714 --> 01:27:43,843
What was its name?
It smelt revoltingly.

1238
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:51,145
Aunt Jane?

1239
01:27:52,893 --> 01:27:56,943
Frozen. That frozen look.

1240
01:27:58,398 --> 01:28:01,368
What was it that Heather Babcock
said to Marina Gregg

1241
01:28:01,485 --> 01:28:04,705
just before she gave the frozen look?

1242
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:08,792
You mean all that interminable nonsense
about how she was ill?

1243
01:28:08,909 --> 01:28:10,877
Marina gave her an autograph

1244
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:13,543
and it was
the most exciting moment of her life.

1245
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:16,212
Yes, it was before
she spilled the drink.

1246
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:19,052
- Here it is.
- It's not good enough.

1247
01:28:19,169 --> 01:28:21,672
We've got to know Heather's exact words.

1248
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:24,641
I'm not sure that I follow you.

1249
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:28,937
- Alice Wetherby's cousin.
- Alice Wetherby's cousin?

1250
01:28:29,054 --> 01:28:32,684
She went into a back room one day
and found her husband had hung himself

1251
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:35,527
from a hook at the top of the ceiling
eight feet high'

1252
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:39,114
There was absolutely nothing else in
the room except the hook, the body

1253
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:41,529
and a small puddle of water
beneath his feet.

1254
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:45,371
Nobody could understand how he'd
manoeuvred himself to perform the deed,

1255
01:28:45,487 --> 01:28:48,741
until it was discovered
he had purchased a two-foot block of ice

1256
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:52,335
from the local fishmonger, 
Mr Croswell.

1257
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:55,251
To this day,
Alice Wetherby's cousin shudders

1258
01:28:55,372 --> 01:28:58,091
at the mere suggestion
of an ice cube in her gin.

1259
01:29:02,045 --> 01:29:03,342
Yes, Aunt Jane.

1260
01:29:03,463 --> 01:29:04,806
Don't you see, Dermot?

1261
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:08,518
Something as trivial as
the suggestion of an ice cube

1262
01:29:08,635 --> 01:29:11,354
when it becomes associated
with another experience,

1263
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:13,394
something that caused great grief,

1264
01:29:13,515 --> 01:29:16,064
it fixes in the mind,
stays with you forever.

1265
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:21,740
Yes, but I'm not sure
what you're getting at.

1266
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:24,861
If only we knew what
Heather actually said.

1267
01:29:32,993 --> 01:29:34,711
Cherry!

1268
01:29:34,828 --> 01:29:39,083
Oh, I'm afraid that's impossible.
At least for now. I've sent her away.

1269
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,584
Whatever for?

1270
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:44,464
Dear boy,
I don't want her to be murdered too.

1271
01:30:15,702 --> 01:30:20,674
Marina, honey.
I brought you something warm to drink.

1272
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:28,389
Hot chocolate.

1273
01:30:28,506 --> 01:30:34,684
Do you remember when we used to drink it
on those cold nights in Sun Valley?

1274
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:36,727
When there was nothing else to do.

1275
01:30:38,141 --> 01:30:39,859
I mean, afterwards.

1276
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:55,496
Sleep tight.

1277
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:03,132
I'll take these.

1278
01:31:04,376 --> 01:31:06,674
You won't be needing them any more.

1279
01:31:11,675 --> 01:31:13,894
Jason?

1280
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:15,887
Hmm?

1281
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:22,481
- I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

1282
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:05,737
<i>[church bells toll]</i>

1283
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:14,780
<i>[cat meows]</i>

1284
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:49,440
<i>[Miss Marple breathes heavily]</i>

1285
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:19,679
Of course, the vicar!

1286
01:34:03,221 --> 01:34:05,940
Thank you, Inch.
If you'll wait, please.

1287
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:24,167
I'm sorry, Miss Marple,
Miss Gregg is not available.

1288
01:34:24,284 --> 01:34:27,037
But it is imperative
that I see her at once.

1289
01:34:27,162 --> 01:34:30,006
My apologies, madam. I have my orders.

1290
01:34:35,879 --> 01:34:37,927
Then I shall wait.

1291
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:47,141
- There is a lady here, sir.
- What kind of a lady?

1292
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:49,063
A somewhat elderly lady, sir.

1293
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:52,734
A Miss Marple.
She refuses to leave. Shall I...'?

1294
01:34:52,854 --> 01:34:55,573
No. I'll get rid of her.

1295
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:08,036
Mr Rudd. Good morning, Mr Rudd.

1296
01:35:08,161 --> 01:35:11,415
Look, Miss, er, Marble,
or whatever your name is,

1297
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:14,509
I don't know what you're doing here,
but you cannot stay.

1298
01:35:14,626 --> 01:35:17,926
It's Marple, and I won't keep you long.
I'm correct, am I not,

1299
01:35:18,046 --> 01:35:20,720
that that is where your wife stood
the day of the murder?

1300
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:25,311
She looked in that direction
and then her face froze.

1301
01:35:25,428 --> 01:35:27,430
I think you'd better leave.

1302
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:31,059
<i>Bellini's Mother and Child.
A very fine painting.</i>

1303
01:35:31,184 --> 01:35:34,814
A present of the Brera Institute
in Milano, I believe.

1304
01:35:34,938 --> 01:35:39,819
The whole thing
is really quite simple, isn't it?

1305
01:35:39,943 --> 01:35:41,911
I don't know what you're talking about.

1306
01:35:42,028 --> 01:35:44,030
I think you do.

1307
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:47,580
- [Miss Marple] Ah, Dermot.
- Good Lord, Aunt Jane.

1308
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:49,577
I might have guessed you'd be here.

1309
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:53,211
This is the spot where it happened,

1310
01:35:53,331 --> 01:35:58,007
which makes it
so much easier to understand.

1311
01:35:58,127 --> 01:36:03,509
It's very simple, if only
one looks at it the proper way.

1312
01:36:03,633 --> 01:36:07,683
It all began, you see, with the kind
of person that Heather Babcock was.

1313
01:36:07,804 --> 01:36:10,227
Damn it, that's enough!

1314
01:36:10,348 --> 01:36:14,478
The two of you come busting
into my house. I want you out. Now!

1315
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:17,230
Perhaps you should call the police,
Mr Rudd.

1316
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:18,982
Let us go back, shall we,

1317
01:36:19,107 --> 01:36:21,906
<i>to the moment when</i>
<i>Heather greets Miss Gregg</i>

1318
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:24,620
<i>and launches into
her efiusive little tale?</i>

1319
01:36:24,737 --> 01:36:28,037
<i>Poor Miss Gregg listened patiently
as Heather rattled on,</i>

1320
01:36:28,157 --> 01:36:29,704
<i>or at least she appeared to.</i>

1321
01:36:29,826 --> 01:36:35,674
<i>And then suddenly
Marina turned her head away.</i>

1322
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:40,136
<i>A strange look came over her face.
A look of doom.</i>

1323
01:36:40,253 --> 01:36:43,598
It had nothing to do
with Lola Brewster's arrival.

1324
01:36:43,715 --> 01:36:47,219
Marina wasn't even looking at her
or poor Heather.

1325
01:36:47,343 --> 01:36:50,187
She was looking at the Madonna.

1326
01:36:51,681 --> 01:36:56,778
A picture of a serene mother
holding a beautiful happy baby.

1327
01:36:58,438 --> 01:37:00,315
I still don't see the connection.

1328
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:03,865
Of course not, you don't know
what Heather actually said.

1329
01:37:03,985 --> 01:37:07,205
Yes, but haven't we
been through all that last night?

1330
01:37:07,322 --> 01:37:09,290
<i>She got out of bed, powdered her nose,</i>

1331
01:37:09,407 --> 01:37:13,207
<i>slipped out of the barracks
determined to see her idol</i>

1332
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:16,628
<i>then proceeded to the theatre
where some relative let her in</i>

1333
01:37:16,748 --> 01:37:18,921
<i>and allowed her to watch
from the wings.</i>

1334
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:24,969
<i>[cheering]</i>

1335
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:09,009
I still don't see where that gets us.

1336
01:38:09,133 --> 01:38:11,932
Neither did I.
And then I thought of the vicar.

1337
01:38:13,262 --> 01:38:17,438
I telephoned him in the middle
of the night. I wasn't at all popular.

1338
01:38:17,558 --> 01:38:21,153
He remembered Heather's convalescence.

1339
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:24,900
She had been ill and spent her sick
leave in the village with her mother.

1340
01:38:25,024 --> 01:38:26,241
You see,

1341
01:38:26,359 --> 01:38:29,488
<i>when Heather Babcock
went to the theatre that evening,</i>

1342
01:38:29,612 --> 01:38:31,580
<i>she was infectious.</i>

1343
01:38:31,697 --> 01:38:35,247
<i>She was suffering from rubella.</i>

1344
01:38:35,368 --> 01:38:38,793
<i>More commonly known
as German measles.</i>

1345
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:55,100
Your wife had a child
that was born mentally retarded.

1346
01:38:55,221 --> 01:38:57,349
She never recovered from the shock.

1347
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:05,445
Marina... contracted German measles
during the pregnancy.

1348
01:39:06,399 --> 01:39:08,527
And she never knew how.

1349
01:39:08,651 --> 01:39:13,248
And then one afternoon, a perfect
stranger tells her with pleasure,

1350
01:39:13,364 --> 01:39:16,709
with pride even, what she has done.

1351
01:39:16,826 --> 01:39:21,377
And you let me kiss you.
Oh, yes, you did!

1352
01:39:23,374 --> 01:39:25,923
What a nice little story, dear.

1353
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:31,466
- Now, can I get you a drink?
- Oh, thank you, yes.

1354
01:39:31,591 --> 01:39:33,468
<i>[Marple] A rather perfect murder.</i>

1355
01:39:33,593 --> 01:39:38,190
Not exactly as Cherry described it.
I was wrong about one thing.

1356
01:39:38,306 --> 01:39:40,775
I deduced that one of the guests
at the party

1357
01:39:40,892 --> 01:39:43,486
took the risk of putting
the poison in the glass.

1358
01:39:43,603 --> 01:39:45,981
But it was unnecessary.
No one would have noticed

1359
01:39:46,105 --> 01:39:50,201
<i>the hostess taking a momentary leave
of absence to visit her bathroom</i>

1360
01:39:50,318 --> 01:39:51,695
<i>to prepare the fetal potion.</i>

1361
01:39:51,819 --> 01:39:53,913
<i>As an actress used to handling props,</i>

1362
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:57,034
<i>she would have had no trouble
jogging Heather's elbow,</i>

1363
01:39:57,158 --> 01:40:01,379
<i>accidentally spilling her drink
and offering her her own.</i>

1364
01:40:01,496 --> 01:40:05,171
<i>Marina had to insist that
she was the intended victim,</i>

1365
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:09,091
<i>that the murder was aimed at her
to support her plot.</i>

1366
01:40:09,212 --> 01:40:11,510
<i>She wrote the notes herself</i>

1367
01:40:11,631 --> 01:40:17,434
Even doctored her coffee at the studio.
It deceived nearly everybody. Nearly.

1368
01:40:17,553 --> 01:40:19,726
But one person saw through it.

1369
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:23,560
You knew, didn't you, Mr Rudd?

1370
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:26,563
It was the notes
that made you finally realise.

1371
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:30,191
The notes your wife forgot
to tell you about.

1372
01:40:30,316 --> 01:40:34,071
If they had been real,
she would have informed you at once.

1373
01:40:34,195 --> 01:40:35,822
So you decided to protect her.

1374
01:40:39,534 --> 01:40:42,208
[Craddock] Mr Rudd,
I'd like to speak to your wife.

1375
01:40:42,328 --> 01:40:45,582
[Miss Marple] Would you mind
if I saw her first?

1376
01:40:45,706 --> 01:40:47,800
Thank you, dear. Mr Rudd.

1377
01:41:09,564 --> 01:41:12,738
- Miss Marple.
- Yes, Mr Rudd?

1378
01:41:14,694 --> 01:41:16,662
She's dead.

1379
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:21,125
I rather suspected as much.
Couldn't you?

1380
01:41:21,242 --> 01:41:22,869
I killed her.

1381
01:41:24,954 --> 01:41:28,504
I put poison in
her hot chocolate last night.

1382
01:41:34,005 --> 01:41:36,679
It was inevitable
she would have been discovered.

1383
01:41:39,093 --> 01:41:41,846
I couldn't let her face the humiliation.

1384
01:41:44,557 --> 01:41:46,935
She's suffered enough.

1385
01:41:47,977 --> 01:41:50,730
You must have loved her very much.

1386
01:42:06,704 --> 01:42:10,834
Mr Rudd,
I think you better come in here.

1387
01:42:28,768 --> 01:42:30,236
Marina?

1388
01:42:35,775 --> 01:42:39,075
<i>[Marple]</i> Mr Rudd.

1389
01:43:09,892 --> 01:43:12,771
She's given
the performance of her life.

1389
01:43:13,305 --> 01:44:13,182
