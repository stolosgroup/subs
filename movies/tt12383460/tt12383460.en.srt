<i>Jane, go do your rounds.
I'll come down and cover the desk.</i>

3
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,041
On my way.

4
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,958
<i>This is Detective Wade Rollins
with the Portland PD.</i>

5
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,375
<i>Leave your name and number,
and I'll get back to you.</i>

6
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:11,000
Detective, uh...
This is Andrea Bowen again.

7
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,416
Sorry. Uh...

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,666
I know it's late,
but could you call me back when you can?

9
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,666
I...

10
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,041
I'd really appreciate it.

11
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,000
<i>I'm just really scared,
and I just...</i>

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
<i>I feel like he's still watching me.</i>

13
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,250
Detective?

14
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,416
<i>Andrea, this is how the world ends.</i>

15
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,833
No.

16
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,166
No!

17
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,791
No!

18
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,208
No, no, no!

19
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,166
No!

20
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,041
Help!

21
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,458
No! No...

22
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,541
Help!

23
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,583
Help! Somebody! No!

24
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,708
No! Help!

25
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,291
Hi, sorry.

26
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,083
I had a bottle of wine, but I drank it,

27
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:54,166
so I brought you this plant,
which I'm now noticing is dead.

28
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,291
- I called you five times.
- What's wrong?

29
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,916
Jenn, Brian's here.

30
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,041
I know, I'm sorry. It's just...

31
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,958
Originally, you weren't coming,
and then Scott invited him,

32
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,500
and I had absolutely no idea. So...

33
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,583
Yeah, I could just...

34
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,708
tell everyone you're not feeling well,
you know?

35
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,291
I think I need a glass of wine.

36
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,666
Hey, Jenn!

37
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,958
Hey, Scotty.

38
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,083
Hey, I am so sorry.

39
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,250
Yes, yes, he is.

40
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,125
- You don't have to apologize.
- He does.

41
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,666
She told me a week ago
that you weren't coming.

42
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,041
- It's her fault.
- Okay. Stop.

43
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,583
You don't know what's happening,
so walk away.

44
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,958
- Okay, that's really cute.
- I love you.

45
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,083
Oh, it's Dr. Meade!

46
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,541
Hi. Dr. Meade.

47
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:55,458
Hi.

48
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,750
This is Jenn. As in, "The Jenn."

49
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,583
- Yes. I'm "The Jenn," apparently.
- Ah!

50
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:05,708
- Collin Meade. Very nice to meet you.
- He's magical. Changed my life.

51
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,916
I got the promotion, like,
a month after working with you?

52
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,125
And this house.
You should totally go see him.

53
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,208
Wow.

54
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,208
What? Everyone needs therapy.

55
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,166
- That's what you say, right?
- You know where the ice tongs are?

56
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,291
- It's by the ice bucket, Scott.
- They're not there.

57
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,791
Babe. Seriously, every time!
I put them beside the ice thing.

58
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,500
It's not every time.

59
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,166
Didn't know therapists
could hang out with their clients.

60
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,916
I mean,
I follow the rules 99% of the time.

61
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,541
Maybe 95?

62
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:47,916
Um...

63
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,083
It was nice meeting you.

64
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,458
- Cheers to your new house.
- My new house!

65
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,625
So, Brian, how's Foghorn?

66
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:06,833
What's Foghorn?

67
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,208
- It's a stupid name, is what it is.
- No, what is it?

68
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:15,125
Uh, the guys created a new software
for some big audio engineer.

69
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,083
I just helped write some of the code.

70
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,708
What about you, Jennifer?

71
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,666
Oh, sorry. What?

72
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,041
Oh, no. I was just, uh...

73
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,333
What do you do?

74
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:30,041
I'm just... Um, I'm sort of
in between jobs at the moment.

75
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:34,541
She's just being modest. Jenny is actually
a killer software engineer.

76
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,500
- Impressive.
- Mm-hmm.

77
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,541
- So, you two ever worked together?
- Brian!

78
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,750
Um... Is there sesame in that?

79
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,875
Oh my God! Brian, I'm so sorry.

80
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,375
It's okay. It's okay.

81
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:52,416
Wow, that would've sucked
if you died in our new house, dude.

82
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:58,250
You know what?
I think I'm gonna leave this right here.

83
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,041
Just in case.

84
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,708
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

85
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,958
- Jennifer.
- Hm. Yes?

86
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,833
I'm headed out, but, uh,
I wanted to leave you this.

87
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:20,000
- In case you're interested.
- Okay.

88
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,250
Good night.

89
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:25,875
You too.

90
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:32,791
Uber?

91
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:37,458
Yeah.
"Viola will be here in nine minutes."

92
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,958
Thanks for saving my life.

93
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,250
Don't mention it.

94
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:49,666
Good night, Jenny.

95
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:51,625
Good night.

96
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,375
Jenny?

97
00:07:58,666 --> 00:07:59,666
Yeah?

98
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:03,541
I have tried really hard
not to bother you, but...

99
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,958
I think about you all the time,
and I just...

100
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,500
I miss you.

101
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,041
I didn't ask you to stay away
because you bother me.

102
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:18,958
Yeah. I know...

103
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,916
Then don't say things like that.

104
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:25,083
When you say things like that,
you make me sound like the bad guy,

105
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,083
and I'm not the bad guy. I'm...

106
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,208
You're not the bad guy.
I'm not saying you are.

107
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:34,208
I'm just... Oh God, what am I saying?
I don't know what I'm saying.

108
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,083
Can I give you a ride home?

109
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,333
- I don't think that's a good id...
- It's just a ride, Jenny.

110
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,583
<i>You guys had sex?</i>

111
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,125
- Do you plan on getting back together?
- No.

112
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,916
I'm stupid. Oh God, I'm the most stupid.

113
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,666
Oh my gosh, you're not. You're not stupid.
You're just... You're...

114
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,250
- You're unhappy.
- Yeah, everyone's unhappy.

115
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,458
No. I'm happy. Scott's happy.

116
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,375
And for the most part,
I hate to say this to you,

117
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,250
but Brian is happy.

118
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,833
What am I supposed to say to that?

119
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:34,041
I think you should see Dr. Meade.

120
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,541
- Who's Dr. Meade?
- My therapist.

121
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,333
- Gina, I'll never do that.
- You met him. He's tall, handsome.

122
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:40,250
- No.
- Come on.

123
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:43,625
Hear me out, okay?
You're isolating. You're unemployed.

124
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,458
Don't pretend like you're not.

125
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,583
And you slept
with your ex-fiancé last night.

126
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,916
- Your life is a vortex of crap right now.
- This is so much fun.

127
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,875
Can you just go for me, please?

128
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,708
- Ugh, fine. Once.
- Great!

129
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,708
I made you an appointment for Friday.

130
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,166
You should've seen me
when I started with him.

131
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,375
Oh, sorry?

132
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,208
I pull my hair.

133
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:05,833
OCD.

134
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,333
Oh.

135
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:11,583
Whatever you're here for,
Dr. Meade will fix it.

136
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,166
Yeah.

137
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,375
He's waiting for you.

138
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,250
Oh, okay. Um, yeah.

139
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,791
Wow, this is cozy.

140
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:29,958
Jennifer.

141
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,666
Just feeding the little guy.

142
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:37,458
You know that having fish
reduces stress and lowers blood pressure?

143
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,500
No, I didn't.

144
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,000
At least that's what I've heard.
Who knows if it's true.

145
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,750
But I do find them calming.

146
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,166
I'm so glad you decided to come in.

147
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,041
And here I am!

148
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,708
Please.

149
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:03,708
I don't feel motivated
to do anything.

150
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:07,166
Or, like, I should probably stop drinking.
I should probably exercise more.

151
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,375
I should probably
get eight hours of sleep at night.

152
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,250
Jennifer, um,

153
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,958
bad habits come from deeper issues.

154
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,791
There's always a root cause.

155
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,666
What might that be for you?

156
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:24,750
I don't know?

157
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,166
Was that a question?

158
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,333
Yes?

159
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,458
Tell me about you and Brian.

160
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:38,291
He's nice. He's sweet, he's funny,
he's smart. It's Brian. I don't know.

161
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,291
Okay. Fine. Um...

162
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,916
We met in college.

163
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,166
We lived together. We worked together.
It was like a whole thing.

164
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,333
I had a miscarriage.

165
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,000
Actually, I was six months along,
so it was a stillbirth.

166
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,875
His name was Daniel.

167
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,083
I got to spend 33 minutes with him.

168
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,958
Brian and I were engaged, and, uh,

169
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,458
you know, we just couldn't
really figure it out after that. So...

170
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,958
Do you have anything after this?

171
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:42,666
No.

172
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,583
Have you ever tried hypnotherapy?

173
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,208
No. No, I have not.

174
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,125
Why the judgment?

175
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:55,291
I'm just not a giving-away-control person,

176
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,000
so it's a pass.

177
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:00,916
Sure. But here's the wonderful thing
about hypnotherapy. All right?

178
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,500
Only you can control your subconscious.

179
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,583
So, you're in control the whole time.

180
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:13,500
And it's an excellent tool
for people who have suffered...

181
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:15,833
trauma.

182
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:22,375
Worst case scenario, it'll stop you
from further destroying your poor fingers.

183
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,166
I don't know.

184
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,666
I had a mentor,

185
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,916
and his name was, uh, Dr. Xavier Sullivan.

186
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,250
He was a brilliant mind. He would say,

187
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:41,000
"Prosaic methods are reserved
for the unimaginative."

188
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:46,541
"One in search of lasting results
dares to open the mind."

189
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,458
Hm.

190
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,125
Jennifer?

191
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,791
What do you want?

192
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,333
Just wanna be happy again, you know?

193
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,000
Then let me help you.

194
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,625
I want you to concentrate on the light.

195
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:21,333
Feel the weight of your body
as it melts into the couch,

196
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,583
muscle by muscle.

197
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,500
Starting at the toes,

198
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,333
the arches of the feet.

199
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,625
Calves. Thighs.

200
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,833
All the way up,

201
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:41,125
until you arrive at the top of your head.

202
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,208
Now,

203
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,125
I want you to find yourself

204
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,166
in a beautiful forest.

205
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,166
That was an hour?

206
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,458
It felt like three minutes.

207
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:25,666
How do you feel?

208
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:29,375
I don't know.
I don't really remember anything.

209
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,583
How'd I do?

210
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,458
I think you might be
more open to suggestibility

211
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,416
than you imagined.

212
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:05,708
<i>That was bizarre.</i>

213
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,375
They called me right after I left.
I start in two weeks.

214
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:14,208
Are you gonna do some yoga with me,
or you're just gonna lie there?

215
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,958
This is Shavasana. It is yoga.

216
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,125
How many sessions did you have
with Dr. Meade?

217
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:24,333
I don't know. Maybe, um, once a week
for about three months now.

218
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,833
I've asked him to do hypnosis twice.

219
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,416
It's not fair.
I wanna conquer all of my fears.

220
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,000
It's a compliment.
You've already conquered all your fears.

221
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,541
Hi, have you seen me and spiders?
Didn't think so.

222
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,166
I'm really proud of you.

223
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,375
You're perfect.

224
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:49,625
Jennifer?

225
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

226
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,416
- You look fantastic as ever.
- Oh, thanks. You too.

227
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Haven't seen you in a couple of weeks.
You're not, uh... you're not avoiding me?

228
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:03,416
Oh, no. I've been meaning to schedule.
It's just I've been busy...

229
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,958
- Sure.
- Oh...

230
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,791
I got the job.

231
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,541
- What? Really?
- Yeah, I did.

232
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,916
- I had no doubt.
- You didn't think I could do it?

233
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,375
No. I never doubted you.

234
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,833
May I buy you a celebratory coffee?

235
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:22,708
Yeah, okay.

236
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:23,875
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

237
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:30,041
I did yoga with Gina,
and I meditated last night.

238
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,000
Amazing.

239
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,666
It was three minutes, and I thought
about my dead plants, but I did it.

240
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,500
- Progress. Not perfection.
- You can't say that.

241
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,000
You're one of those people
that wakes up at 5:00 a.m.

242
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,083
- and you're perfect at everything.
- Hardly.

243
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:45,666
And one of those who hangs out
with his clients but is very private.

244
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:52,916
All right.

245
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,125
I'll play.

246
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:00,416
I'm 46. Only child.

247
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:06,125
Uh, I was married once
to the love of my life, Amy.

248
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:11,125
We were happy, but she died.

249
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,333
I'm so sorry.

250
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,958
What do they say?

251
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,125
"Wanna make God laugh,
tell him your plans."

252
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:21,166
But, Jennifer,
the important thing to remember

253
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,375
is that being a victim is a choice,

254
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,583
and we can let our hardships define us,

255
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:30,333
consume us, or we can accept

256
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:34,125
the extraordinary abilities
that we have in this life

257
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,250
to create the outcome we choose.

258
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,833
- For ourselves. May I?
- Mm.

259
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,291
Eyelash.

260
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,750
Thank you.

261
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:52,125
All right, well, enough about me. Um...

262
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:55,000
So, last we spoke,
you were struggling a bit with Brian.

263
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,166
How's it going there?

264
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,791
I don't know. I have been avoiding him.

265
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,791
When you see Brian, uh,

266
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,041
is it hard for you?

267
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,041
Yeah.

268
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,625
Have you considered telling him this?

269
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,291
And if you did?

270
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:18,416
He may be hurt because we still care
about each other a lot.

271
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,416
Let me suggest something,
and you can take it or leave it,

272
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,208
but I think you'd be wise to take it.

273
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,333
Okay.

274
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,958
Invite Brian to your place
for dinner tonight.

275
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,791
- No.
- Why not?

276
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,791
I can think of infinite reasons why not.

277
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,125
Trust me. You'll be on your turf.
You can cook a good meal.

278
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:39,833
Tell him you got
some matters you need to discuss.

279
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,750
I think it'd be very good for you.

280
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,791
But not easy.
I mean, I'm not saying that. But...

281
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,416
But good.

282
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:51,708
'Cause, Jennifer,

283
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,291
you don't have to be a victim anymore.

284
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,958
<i>Hey, it's Brian.
I got your message.</i>

285
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,833
<i>Yeah, uh, I'll be there.</i>

286
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,291
<i>Let me know if you want me
to bring anything. See you soon.</i>

287
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,291
Hello?

288
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:28,791
Hey, hey, hey!

289
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:29,875
Where's your pen?

290
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:32,333
Where's your...

291
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:56,875
Hey.

292
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:06,750
It was an accident, Jenn.

293
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:11,125
I mean, I almost killed him
at our housewarming party.

294
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:12,666
You're the one who caught it.

295
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:15,500
I can't remember anything.

296
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,791
- You're probably just in shock.
- No, I'm not in shock.

297
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:21,625
I'm serious. I...

298
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,000
I remember being at the store.

299
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,500
And then I'm at home sitting at the table.

300
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:37,458
Come on. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take you home.

301
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:45,333
<i>How's Brian?</i>

302
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:49,541
Sorry?

303
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,375
Brian. How is he?

304
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,333
He's the same.

305
00:24:57,666 --> 00:25:00,000
- How long has it been now?
- Eight days.

306
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:08,041
Do you remember
anything else from that night?

307
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,416
Is there any way
that I could be responsible

308
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,250
for what happened that night?

309
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:19,083
Why do you ask?

310
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:21,666
Because I can't stop thinking about it.

311
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,416
The way it felt,

312
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:26,916
and the missing time.

313
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,458
It's like what we do here.

314
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:30,750
Hm.

315
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:36,083
Do you remember what I told you
the first time we discussed hypnosis?

316
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:41,166
That only you have the power,
control over your subconscious.

317
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:46,166
- Yeah, but...
- Jennifer, listen to me.

318
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,125
We all have these wounds,

319
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:55,750
and every time we let the world run us,
those wounds fester.

320
00:25:56,625 --> 00:26:01,708
But that's a choice
based on some preconceived notion

321
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:05,458
that the world
can even run us in the first place.

322
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:07,791
It's ego.

323
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:11,833
Ego derived from fear.

324
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:13,583
You follow?

325
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:20,041
So, the work we're doing
is designed to eliminate that fear,

326
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,791
but the moment
you start to doubt our work,

327
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,375
fear wins.

328
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:28,416
Is that what you want?

329
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:30,416
To let fear win?

330
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:33,541
No.

331
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:37,083
So you need to trust me...

332
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:40,416
and keep doing the work.

333
00:27:58,833 --> 00:27:59,833
Hello?

334
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:01,458
<i>Jennifer,</i>

335
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:03,416
<i>carry the fire.</i>

336
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:45,541
<i>This is a terrible turn of events,</i>

337
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:48,416
<i>as the family is reeling
after losing their daughter,</i>

338
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
<i>and they still have no information
from police.</i>

339
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:52,958
<i>...and in Portland,
there's an investigation</i>

340
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:55,291
<i>into the death of their daughter</i>.

341
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:59,041
<i>She'd recently taken out
a restraining order on her psychiatrist.</i>

342
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:02,125
<i>Of course, it's been
a game-changer to the entire case</i>

343
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:06,333
<i>as the police are now looking towards
finding out further information as what...</i>

344
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,250
<i>The study into crimes while under hypnosis</i>

345
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,375
<i>is new to the state criminal court.</i>

346
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:14,541
<i>There are currently board psychiatrists...</i>

347
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:27,333
I don't know, Jenn. It's just...
I get why you'd be concerned.

348
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:31,375
I mean, it's not exactly comforting news,
but I just... I don't see it.

349
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:33,583
No, look. It says here in the article,

350
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:36,333
"Bowen told her family
she was experiencing missing time."

351
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:39,916
That is what happened to me.
It was after I had lunch with Dr. Meade,

352
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,041
where he suggested
I had Brian over for dinner.

353
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:45,250
- It just feels like a big leap.
- Look at the background check.

354
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:47,166
You ran a background check?

355
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,375
Yes. Look,
the only address listed is his office.

356
00:29:50,458 --> 00:29:53,833
There's no private residence,
employers, or unpaid parking tickets.

357
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:56,750
The man is basically a ghost
until six months ago

358
00:29:56,833 --> 00:30:00,166
when someone takes out
a restraining order. This is his patient,

359
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,541
and he is torturing her. Stalking.

360
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:04,875
Psychological abuse, emotional abuse.

361
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:06,833
Maybe she was crazy.

362
00:30:08,416 --> 00:30:10,291
This woman was afraid for her life,

363
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:13,791
and then three days
after she files a restraining order,

364
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:14,791
she's dead.

365
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:16,000
She had a heart attack.

366
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:19,333
What if there is something else going on?

367
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:25,375
- What if he did something to her?
- Okay. This is where you lose me.

368
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:29,625
Therapists use hypnotherapy
to help their patients quit smoking.

369
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:32,333
Not to hack into their brains
and stop their heart.

370
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:35,708
- This is not a thing.
- Yes, it... Look, I thought that too.

371
00:30:35,791 --> 00:30:39,000
In Sweden, a group of teenagers
are hypnotized to deal drugs,

372
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,666
and they experienced blackouts.

373
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:44,291
In Germany, Zebediah Cantor is hypnotized
to rob banks, and he has missing time...

374
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,666
Okay, I get it.

375
00:30:57,416 --> 00:30:59,875
And this is from that night with Brian.

376
00:31:08,958 --> 00:31:10,625
He called me, Gina.

377
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:13,625
Right before I blacked out.

378
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,000
Dr. Meade?

379
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,958
I remember everything now.

380
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:26,291
I did it on purpose, Gina.

381
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:29,291
It... But it wasn't me. It was, it was...

382
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:31,333
But I did do it.

383
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:36,416
And then I just sat there and watched.

384
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:41,208
I didn't do anything.

385
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,416
I didn't get help.

386
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:48,958
I didn't even move until I came out of it.

387
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:54,666
I'm not crazy.

388
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,166
So, what do we do?

389
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:09,625
Hey.

390
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:14,250
Thank you so much for meeting with us,
detective, on such short notice.

391
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:17,416
- We really appreciate it.
- What can I do for you?

392
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,708
We wanted to ask you some questions
about a woman named Andrea Bowen.

393
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,750
Uh-huh.

394
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:28,791
Six months ago, she filed
a restraining order against Collin Meade.

395
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:31,083
I know the case. What's your question?

396
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,541
Her family said
that she died of a heart attack,

397
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:36,541
but then they wanted
a broader investigation.

398
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:39,250
Did that investigation ever happen?

399
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,583
Why are you asking?

400
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:43,250
Because Dr. Meade is our therapist.

401
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,541
Something strange is happening.

402
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:50,416
Strange how?

403
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:52,375
I've been having

404
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:54,875
weird dreams.

405
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:56,708
But they don't feel like dreams.

406
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:00,166
You've been practicing hypnosis
with Dr. Meade, Miss Thompson?

407
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:02,750
Huh.

408
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:05,916
Collin Meade
was brought in for questioning

409
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,458
a week after Bowen's death.

410
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:09,416
Got us nowhere.

411
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:11,541
I wanted to keep digging.

412
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:14,125
I got a warrant,
obtained his patient records.

413
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:15,208
Didn't matter.

414
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:17,250
Got shut down that day.

415
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:20,333
Told I couldn't even
finish going through what we had.

416
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:21,541
Why?

417
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:25,750
Meade was also
practicing hypnosis with Andrea.

418
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:28,958
It's funny.
Cops using old witnesses sometimes.

419
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:32,291
Try and get them to remember things
they may have seen.

420
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:34,000
If it works,

421
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:37,541
it becomes evidence in court,

422
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:41,541
but if you're a victim,
claiming someone used hypnosis

423
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:45,708
with ill intent, that kinda thing,
they'll laugh you out of the room.

424
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:47,708
You don't think
she died of a heart attack?

425
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,541
Oh my God!

426
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:59,041
And then there's this.

427
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:03,333
Incoming call came from a blocked number.

428
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,875
- Her behavior changed when she answered.
- That happened to me.

429
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:08,708
What is she doing?

430
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:11,541
You ever heard of "quiescence"?

431
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:13,125
No.

432
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:16,125
It's the body's reaction to extreme fear.

433
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:19,708
The body enters paralysis,
heart rate increases,

434
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,416
breathing intensifies.

435
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:23,708
But if it goes on too long, you die.

436
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:27,583
Maybe, technically,
she died of a heart attack,

437
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:31,333
but whatever she was seeing
in the elevator is what caused it.

438
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:33,375
So, what do I think?

439
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:39,041
I think you should find yourselves
a new therapist.

440
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:48,791
I'll talk to you later, okay?

441
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:50,541
Yeah.

442
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:54,958
Jenn?

443
00:34:57,833 --> 00:34:59,416
He hypnotized me.

444
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,750
What?

445
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:04,791
When?

446
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:06,208
This week.

447
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:08,791
We talked about you, I...

448
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:13,500
It's just... You were so worried
that something happened with Brian,

449
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:15,125
and then he just...

450
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:19,666
He said he was wrong before,
and then he thought that it might help me.

451
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:23,000
It's okay, it's okay.

452
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:25,416
We'll do what Det. Rollins said.
We'll stay away.

453
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:33,083
We'll figure this out, okay?

454
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:46,666
<i>Hey, Dr. Meade, it's Jennifer Thompson.
We just saw each other,</i>

455
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,208
<i>but I was wondering if you had
any last-minute appointments available.</i>

456
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:53,166
<i>Call me back when you can. Bye.</i>

457
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:18,291
Jennifer. Please, come in.

458
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:24,083
- I was thrilled to get your call.
- Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in.

459
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:30,250
Was there something in particular
you wanted to talk about?

460
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:35,500
No. Not... Nothing really, actually.
It's just, um,

461
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:38,166
a general anxiety.

462
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:40,333
Mm-hmm.

463
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:44,833
Brian's not awake yet, and so that's hard.

464
00:36:45,416 --> 00:36:46,416
Yeah.

465
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,000
I thought just a bit
of hypnosis might help?

466
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:55,208
Of course.

467
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:58,125
Okay.

468
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:54,916
Lillian Dorsey.

469
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:00,916
<i>Date of death, 11/27/2019.</i>

470
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:06,833
<i>I'm looking for Adrienne Dorsey.</i>

471
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:09,500
<i>This is Detective Wade Rollins
with the Portland PD.</i>

472
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:13,083
<i>I was hoping I could ask you
some questions regarding your sister.</i>

473
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:16,750
<i>Date of death, June 15, 2018. Hypnosis.</i>

474
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:18,375
<i>Andrea Bowen. Hypnosis.</i>

475
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:29,541
<i>Was there something in particular</i>

476
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:31,291
<i>you wanted to talk about?</i>

477
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:35,333
<i>I thought just a bit
of hypnosis might help?</i>

478
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:37,125
<i>Of course.</i>

479
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:41,708
<i>Jennifer?</i>

480
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:44,166
<i>- Yes?
- Are you under?</i>

481
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,791
<i>- Yes.
- Good.</i>

482
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:50,666
<i>I'm going to ask you some questions,
and you're gonna tell me the truth.</i>

483
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,083
<i>Why did you really come see me today?</i>

484
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:55,666
<i>To record you.</i>

485
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
<i>Are you recording me now?</i>

486
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:00,083
<i>Yes.</i>

487
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:03,750
<i>And why are you recording me?</i>

488
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:07,250
<i>Because I want to hear
what happens during our sessions.</i>

489
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:10,000
<i>- Do you not trust me?
- No.</i>

490
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:12,041
<i>Hmm.</i>

491
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:14,416
<i>Why not?</i>

492
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,083
<i>Because I know about Andrea Bowen.</i>

493
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:21,666
<i>Is this why you were
at the police station this morning?</i>

494
00:39:22,791 --> 00:39:23,791
<i>Yes.</i>

495
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:26,875
<i>You were with Gina.</i>

496
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,625
<i>I assume she knows everything you know.</i>

497
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:32,833
<i>- Yes.
- Yes.</i>

498
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:35,750
<i>Thank you for being honest, my love.</i>

499
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:45,625
- Dude, what quarter is it?
- Tell him to not...

500
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:48,083
No, they are not up
by seven, bro!

501
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:50,750
- I'm serious. Hang up.
- I gotta go before she kills me.

502
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,791
- See?
- No, it's Jenn!

503
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:58,208
Tell him I told him wassup!
Keep me informed. Yeah, okay, peace.

504
00:39:59,541 --> 00:40:02,291
Girl, I gotta call you back.
I have buyers calling any minute.

505
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:07,083
- Gina. Gina, where are you?
- I'm just in the car with Scott.

506
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:09,000
- <i>Hey, Jenny.</i>
- Where are you?

507
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:10,416
We just left the house.

508
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,250
Turn around and go back to the house.

509
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:13,833
<i>- I'm coming to you.</i>
- What? Why?

510
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:17,208
Could you go back to the house?
You need to go back, listen to me.

511
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:20,375
<i>- Gina, get...</i>
- I'm sorry, you're cutting out. I can't...

512
00:40:21,625 --> 00:40:23,208
This is them. I'll call you back.

513
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:27,000
No, Gina! He knows we were
at the police station. He knows!

514
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:29,166
Gina?

515
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:31,541
Fucking shit!

516
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:44,416
This is Gina.

517
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,416
<i>Gina, it's Dr. Meade.</i>

518
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,041
<i>Sorry to bother you,
but do you have a moment to chat?</i>

519
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:51,291
I'm just in the car with Scott.

520
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:54,541
<i>Even better.
Gina, this is how the world ends.</i>

521
00:40:56,625 --> 00:40:57,833
What was that?

522
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:05,875
Get it off of me.

523
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:07,708
What?

524
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:09,291
Scott.

525
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:10,875
Gina.

526
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:16,416
- Get what off?
- Get it off. Please!

527
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,541
What? There's nothing there. Get what off?

528
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:20,958
- Get it off of me! Please!
- Gina, relax. Gina!

529
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:23,416
Get it off!

530
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,500
Gina, stop!

531
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:27,208
Get it off! Get it off!

532
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:29,166
No!

533
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:07,791
Detective Rollins.
What a pleasant surprise.

534
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:10,250
Care for a scotch?

535
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:19,625
Gina Kaleman died
in a car accident tonight.

536
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:22,291
What?

537
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:27,541
- Her husband too.
- You're kidding me.

538
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,708
Oh my God.

539
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:35,125
How long was she a patient?

540
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,416
I don't know. Maybe...

541
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,250
...eight months?

542
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:46,750
- What were you treating her for?
- She came to me with some, uh...

543
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,625
...generalized anxiety initially.

544
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:53,583
Hmm.

545
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:58,333
You ever perform hypnosis on Gina?

546
00:43:58,416 --> 00:44:01,708
Yes. Uh, we performed
our first session last week.

547
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:03,583
Started small, you know?

548
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:06,791
- Explored her common phobia.
- Claustrophobia?

549
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:08,000
Arachnophobia.

550
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:14,291
The last claustrophobic patient
I dealt with was, uh...

551
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,583
Well, it was Andrea Bowen, actually.

552
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:20,083
Hmm.

553
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:23,583
You know what I always loved as a kid?

554
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:25,375
Puzzles.

555
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:30,375
I'm sure it has something to do
with why I became a detective.

556
00:44:31,291 --> 00:44:34,291
Putting the pieces together,
finding the patterns.

557
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,708
That was always the key.

558
00:44:37,666 --> 00:44:38,666
Patterns.

559
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,416
I looked through
some of your patient files today.

560
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:46,000
The ones we obtained after Andrea's death.

561
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:50,208
I got to chat with family members,
and I noticed something.

562
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:52,083
A pattern.

563
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:56,208
You don't use hypnotherapy
on all of your patients.

564
00:44:58,166 --> 00:44:59,666
Just a few, actually.

565
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:02,750
Andrea Bowen.

566
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:04,875
Lillian Dorsey.

567
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:06,791
Mona Szohr.

568
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:10,000
They share some physical characteristics,

569
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:13,708
and they also all happen to be dead.

570
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,791
You ever noticed that?

571
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:18,958
That pattern?

572
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,250
Gina Kaleman doesn't match your MO.

573
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:33,291
I think you had something else in mind
when it came to her.

574
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:37,125
Is there something specific
you wanted to talk about tonight, Wade?

575
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,583
Because if not, I should be going.
It's getting late.

576
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,333
It's Detective Rollins.

577
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:47,416
- Thanks for the booze.
- Oh, Wade.

578
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,291
Hypnotherapy works wonders for insomnia.

579
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,125
You wanna try it?
I'll give you a free session.

580
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:56,416
Thought you only took female patients.

581
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,041
I'll make an exception.

582
00:46:21,916 --> 00:46:23,583
My phone died, or I would have called.

583
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:29,750
Um, I heard about your friend.

584
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:35,833
I just thought I could catch him
saying something or doing something.

585
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
He was at the station.
He's been following us.

586
00:46:41,458 --> 00:46:42,583
He's smart.

587
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:44,958
Always a step ahead.

588
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:49,958
There's a reason he never hypnotized Gina
until you started asking questions.

589
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:53,208
He knew you would go to her.
She got in the way.

590
00:46:54,416 --> 00:46:56,041
You can't blame yourself, Jenn.

591
00:46:56,666 --> 00:46:58,125
And just why me?

592
00:46:58,625 --> 00:46:59,750
Well, I don't know.

593
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,208
But not long after Andrea
started asking questions,

594
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:06,000
she was dead.

595
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:10,375
He's not done with you yet,
or you would be too.

596
00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:17,666
I got his prints. I'm gonna run 'em,
see if we're missing anything.

597
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:20,500
I should know more tomorrow.

598
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:22,583
For now,

599
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:24,500
lay low.

600
00:47:26,416 --> 00:47:27,416
Detective.

601
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:29,458
Thank you.

602
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:31,916
Try and get some rest.

603
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:34,166
I'll call you in the morning.

604
00:48:05,958 --> 00:48:07,500
Did you forget something?

605
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:08,500
Hello, Jennifer.

606
00:48:11,916 --> 00:48:13,250
Jennifer, stop!

607
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:25,916
You don't need to be afraid of me.
I just wanna talk.

608
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:32,291
What did I do to you
to make you not trust me?

609
00:48:32,916 --> 00:48:33,916
Huh?

610
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,791
Think about it.

611
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:39,333
I invited you in. I listened.

612
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,500
Really, you should be thanking me.

613
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:47,958
I asked you what you wanted,
and I'm working so hard to give you that.

614
00:48:53,791 --> 00:48:57,708
And Brian and Gina were just gonna
get in the way of your dreams.

615
00:48:57,791 --> 00:48:59,416
And now Rollins.

616
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:05,541
Don't worry. He'll be taken care of.

617
00:49:06,416 --> 00:49:10,208
Everything I'm doing is for you, Jennifer.

618
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,041
And I know there's been a lot of

619
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:18,708
build-up and anticipation, but...

620
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,541
that's just the romantic in me.

621
00:49:27,333 --> 00:49:30,000
It's almost over.

622
00:49:34,291 --> 00:49:35,791
You're so close.

623
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:43,708
Hmm?

624
00:49:49,708 --> 00:49:51,291
I'll see you soon, okay?

625
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:55,958
Oh, Jennifer...

626
00:49:56,708 --> 00:49:58,416
Relax.

627
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:15,958
Pick up. Pick up.

628
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:18,500
<i>This is Detective Wade Rollins...</i>

629
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:19,875
Come on, come on.

630
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,843
<i>When the police ran his prints</i>,

631
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:50,416
<i>they discovered his real identity.
He had changed his name.</i>

632
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,375
<i>And who was he, really?</i>

633
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:55,416
<i>A killer.
Wanted for murder in three states.</i>

634
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,500
<i>Tonight, on </i>The Crime Files.

635
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:58,666
<i>In the fall of 2014,</i>

636
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:02,875
<i>seventeen-year-old Victoria Wilson
disappeared from her suburban home</i>

<i>in Metuchen, New Jersey,</i>

638

<i>leaving her parents

639
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,500

640
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:14,416
<i>Three days later, her body was found
in a forest 300 miles from home.</i>

641
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:17,541
<i>So, what happened to Victoria Wilson?</i>

642
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:21,125
<i>Billy Adler came home from school</i>

643
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:23,916
<i>to find his mom dead
at the dining room table,</i>

644
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,500
<i>shot in the head.</i>

645
00:52:25,583 --> 00:52:29,166
<i>The police ruled it a suicide.
But Billy knew his mom would nev...</i>

646
00:53:26,166 --> 00:53:28,666
<i>I can't tell them
I think Meade was involved.</i>

647
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:31,291
<i>They don't know
I've been digging into this.</i>

648
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:35,208
I'm so sorry, Rollins.

649
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,583
You read 'em?

650
00:53:44,833 --> 00:53:45,833
And?

651
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:48,833
And I have an idea.

652
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:53,666
When Gina and I came to see you,
you said something about

653
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:56,750
how police sometimes use hypnosis.

654
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:57,916
Hm.

655
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,041
What did you mean?

656
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:03,875
A drive-by shooter
speeds away from the scene.

657
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:08,583
An eyewitness saw the car
but can't remember the license plate.

658
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:11,750
Well, maybe they do remember it.

659
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:13,625
Just not consciously.

660
00:54:14,458 --> 00:54:18,791
So, we send them to a hypnotist
who tries to help them recall.

661
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:22,041
And that will hold up as evidence?

662
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:23,875
- Sometimes.
- What if we did that?

663
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:28,541
What if you sent me
to whoever you use for that sort of thing?

664
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:30,125
And they put me under

665
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:33,333
and try to make me recall
my sessions with Meade.

666
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,458
- It still may not be enough.
- You just said...

667
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:38,000
I said, "Sometimes."

668
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:41,875
Do you know how hard it is
to charge someone with murder

669
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:43,708
and get them convicted?

670
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:47,083
But he all but confessed to me
that he's responsible for Brian and Gina.

671
00:54:47,166 --> 00:54:49,333
- You recorded it?
- He said he was coming after...

672
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:50,416
Jenn.

673
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:55,208
With everything else we have,
the other victims, the pattern...

674
00:54:56,875 --> 00:54:59,833
He's planning something. I know he is.

675
00:55:00,375 --> 00:55:03,250
I don't know what,
but the way he was talking last night...

676
00:55:06,291 --> 00:55:07,291
Please.

677
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:10,916
I just wanna try.

678
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:42,333
Please wake up.

679
00:55:53,166 --> 00:55:54,541
<i>You were with Gina.</i>

680
00:55:55,958 --> 00:55:57,916
<i>I assume she knows everything you know.</i>

681
00:55:58,416 --> 00:55:59,875
<i>- Yes.
- Yes.</i>

682
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,625
<i>Well, thank you for being honest, my love.</i>

683
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:07,291
<i>I'll take all of your concerns
into consideration.</i>

684
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:10,791
And then he cuts it short.

685
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:14,750
Jenn.

686
00:56:15,916 --> 00:56:19,166
How much do you really know
about hypnotherapy?

687
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,875
Not much.

688
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:23,333
Well, it's an incredibly powerful tool.

689
00:56:24,708 --> 00:56:27,500
When handled with care and integrity,

690
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:29,500
it can be a force for good.

691
00:56:30,666 --> 00:56:33,583
But in the wrong hands,
hypnosis can be dangerous.

692
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,416
What are you feeling?

693
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,375
I am having, um,

694
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:51,166
some trust issues
with your profession right now.

695
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:56,791
Jenn, I understand
that this may not be worth much,

696
00:56:57,791 --> 00:56:59,416
but you can trust me.

697
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:02,375
I'm one of the good ones.

698
00:57:03,416 --> 00:57:05,333
And I'm only gonna have a look around.

699
00:57:06,666 --> 00:57:11,208
Just see what the subconscious retained
from those sessions with Dr. Meade.

700
00:57:11,875 --> 00:57:12,875
Hmm?

701
00:57:21,416 --> 00:57:23,708
Focus on the sound
of the metronome,

702
00:57:24,583 --> 00:57:25,833
keeping time.

703
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,375
And as you feel the weight of your body

704
00:57:30,958 --> 00:57:33,333
sinking into the couch,

705
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:36,083
I want you to let everything go.

706
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:41,875
Let the world around you slow down.

707
00:57:51,666 --> 00:57:54,166
<i>Jenn, can you hear me?</i>

708
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:55,250
<i>Yes.</i>

709
00:57:55,791 --> 00:57:59,041
<i>Now, I want you to tell me
everything you remember</i>

710
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:02,500
<i>from your sessions with Dr. Collin Meade.</i>

711
00:58:08,375 --> 00:58:09,375
Jenn?

712
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,625
Wake up, Jenn.

713
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:16,750
Jennifer!

714
00:58:18,708 --> 00:58:21,333
I need you to listen
to the sound of my voice

715
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:23,750
and come back to this room right now!

716
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:31,750
My mentor was a psychiatrist.

717
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:33,166
Dr. Xavier Sullivan.

718
00:59:19,583 --> 00:59:21,666
<i>Wake up, Jennifer!</i>

719
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
What happened?

720
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,416
Dr. Graham, what happened?

721
00:59:40,041 --> 00:59:42,083
I've never seen anything like that.

722
00:59:44,208 --> 00:59:46,375
He must have planted some sort of

723
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,583
fail-safe or...

724
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:49,750
What's a fail-safe?

725
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:52,333
In case anybody
ever tried to do what we're doing.

726
00:59:53,541 --> 00:59:55,208
And I have no way of knowing

727
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:58,833
how many sustained
post-hypnotic suggestions he placed.

728
01:00:01,208 --> 01:00:03,541
And these can be triggered
at any given moment.

729
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,791
I remember something.

730
01:00:19,541 --> 01:00:20,708
There was a house.

731
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:34,250
What's today's date?

732
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:36,208
It's the sixth.

733
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,125
- I have to go.
- No, wait.

734
01:00:47,916 --> 01:00:50,208
There's one more thing I could try.

735
01:00:50,291 --> 01:00:52,416
Look, I can't remove
all of his suggestions,

736
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:56,416
but maybe I could plant
something of my own.

737
01:00:57,958 --> 01:00:59,458
Like a counter trigger?

738
01:01:02,083 --> 01:01:03,083
Exactly.

739
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:08,416
I swear to God,
this is the last time I'm doing this.

740
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:49,541
<i>Rollins, it didn't work.</i>

741
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:53,000
<i>But I found out that Meade
has a mentor named Xavier Sullivan.</i>

742
01:01:53,083 --> 01:01:53,916
<i>Okay.</i>

743
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,708
<i>Have you heard
of "Project MKUltra"?</i>

744
01:01:56,791 --> 01:01:59,375
<i>Yeah, it was a CIA project
in the '60s.</i>

745
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:02,958
<i>Well, Sullivan is a hypnotist.
And the CIA had recruited him</i>

746
01:02:03,041 --> 01:02:05,958
<i>to use hypnosis
to plant false memories in people.</i>

747
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:07,708
<i>I'm on my way to see him.</i>

748
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:09,583
<i>No, Jenn, that's not a good idea.</i>

749
01:02:09,666 --> 01:02:12,583
<i>He might know something
about Meade that can help us.</i>

750
01:02:12,666 --> 01:02:14,726
<i>- Just wait for me.
- We don't have time.</i>

751
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,708
<i>Jenn. Jenn!</i>

752
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:05,166
Mr. Sullivan?

753
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:14,666
Hello?

754
01:03:23,416 --> 01:03:24,750
Anybody home?

755
01:03:37,791 --> 01:03:39,250
Mr. Sullivan?

756
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:58,541
Oh my God.

757
01:03:59,208 --> 01:04:00,833
It's uncanny, isn't it?

758
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:05,583
My wife was such a beautiful woman,

759
01:04:06,625 --> 01:04:08,458
but then so are you, Jennifer.

760
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:12,250
- I don't understand.
- Xavier was my father.

761
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,583
He left me this place when he died.

762
01:04:18,583 --> 01:04:19,583
Jennifer.

763
01:04:19,666 --> 01:04:21,125
- No, just wait.
- Sleep.

764
01:04:29,416 --> 01:04:30,291
It's Rollins.

765
01:04:30,375 --> 01:04:33,166
<i>Hey, Rollins.
I ran the prints from that spoon.</i>

766
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:35,708
<i>They belonged to a man
named Julian Sullivan.</i>

767
01:04:36,333 --> 01:04:37,583
<i>Info's in your inbox.</i>

768
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:50,166
<i>You reached Jenn Thompson.
Leave a message.</i>

769
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,250
Son of a bitch!

770
01:05:12,833 --> 01:05:15,625
- Jenn, where are you?
- Rollins, it was Meade.

771
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:18,750
<i>- His real name is Sullivan.</i>
- Jenn, tell me where you are.

772
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:20,458
He brought me back to his office.

773
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:23,541
- <i>But where is he?</i>
- Door is locked. I don't know!

774
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:26,625
I'm sending units now. Hey, taxi!

775
01:05:26,708 --> 01:05:28,541
Move! Drive!

776
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,541
How are you feeling?

777
01:05:40,125 --> 01:05:42,375
Jennifer, take a seat.

778
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
You know...

779
01:06:03,791 --> 01:06:06,625
I'll never forget
that first time I saw you.

780
01:06:09,916 --> 01:06:12,500
- Give me something.
<i>- We've entered the building.</i>

781
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:17,500
You look like her,

782
01:06:18,166 --> 01:06:19,375
walk like her,

783
01:06:20,833 --> 01:06:22,291
you even smell like her.

784
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:26,041
There's nothing
quite like a woman's scent.

785
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:29,916
The moment you catch it, it's just...

786
01:06:32,083 --> 01:06:33,333
Just like that.

787
01:06:34,625 --> 01:06:35,500
Memories.

788
01:06:38,583 --> 01:06:39,583
Come on.

789
01:06:48,458 --> 01:06:50,458
On the floor. Approaching suite.

790
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:53,166
There were a few others,

791
01:06:53,875 --> 01:06:55,750
and they seemed right at first,

792
01:06:55,833 --> 01:06:58,083
but ultimately,

793
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:00,583
they just weren't meant to be.

794
01:07:02,958 --> 01:07:03,958
We're at the door.

795
01:07:04,833 --> 01:07:06,541
What are you waiting for? Get in!

796
01:07:07,166 --> 01:07:09,458
I mean, I see why now, though.

797
01:07:10,125 --> 01:07:11,375
They were close.

798
01:07:12,583 --> 01:07:13,666
But you're perfect.

799
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:14,875
Move, move!

800
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:23,416
And now I have you all to myself.

801
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:25,500
On my count.

802
01:07:28,041 --> 01:07:29,083
Jennifer.

803
01:07:32,291 --> 01:07:33,791
You can wake up now.

804
01:07:45,083 --> 01:07:46,166
Where am I?

805
01:07:48,541 --> 01:07:49,541
You're home.

806
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:03,041
- Sir, there's no one here.
- What do you mean there's no one there?

807
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:04,916
The office is empty, sir.

808
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:09,708
He wanted her to call me.

809
01:08:10,333 --> 01:08:12,166
Detective Wade Rollins to dispatch.

810
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:14,666
I need a residential address
to one Xavier Sullivan.

811
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:16,541
<i>Copy that.</i>

812
01:08:30,416 --> 01:08:32,208
I can't move.

813
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:34,083
I know.

814
01:08:35,666 --> 01:08:38,500
I'm not thrilled
you started biting your nails again.

815
01:08:41,291 --> 01:08:42,666
We'll have to work on that.

816
01:08:45,333 --> 01:08:46,916
I know this room.

817
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:50,833
I was hoping you'd recognize it.

818
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:53,250
They weren't dreams.

819
01:09:02,291 --> 01:09:04,708
Oh, they were your memories with her.

820
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:07,291
Some of my favorites.

821
01:09:09,166 --> 01:09:11,333
You put them in my head

822
01:09:12,416 --> 01:09:14,583
because you're trying to replace her.

823
01:09:15,291 --> 01:09:16,916
The power of hypnosis.

824
01:09:20,708 --> 01:09:23,708
The memory, planted in the mind,

825
01:09:24,208 --> 01:09:27,125
given the right amount
of care and attention,

826
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:31,000
will blossom into a whole new reality.

827
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,833
A whole new life.

828
01:09:32,916 --> 01:09:35,916
Make someone believe
they're somewhere they're not or,

829
01:09:36,583 --> 01:09:38,833
you know, paralyze from head to toe,

830
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:41,458
all with a simple suggestion.

831
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:44,125
My mentor taught me at...

832
01:09:44,625 --> 01:09:47,208
- Oh my gosh, a very young age.
- Your father?

833
01:09:47,291 --> 01:09:50,500
Father, mentor. Interchangeable
for a young boy.

834
01:09:51,958 --> 01:09:53,125
You're insane.

835
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:09,666
I am not insane.

836
01:10:18,958 --> 01:10:20,833
We want the same thing.

837
01:10:27,125 --> 01:10:28,791
We share wounds.

838
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:37,333
Your loss of Brian and your son Daniel.

839
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:39,750
My loss of Amy

840
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:43,041
and the life I thought we'd have together.

841
01:10:46,625 --> 01:10:48,458
We will be that for each other.

842
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,083
Go like this.

843
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:58,041
And now, for the grand finale.

844
01:11:00,541 --> 01:11:01,708
Don't move.

845
01:11:23,958 --> 01:11:26,625
You don't happen
to know today's date, do you?

846
01:11:29,875 --> 01:11:31,375
Now you know why I waited.

847
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:35,833
Our anniversary.

848
01:11:37,166 --> 01:11:38,375
I told you,

849
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:42,666
I'm a romantic.

850
01:12:00,458 --> 01:12:01,875
And there she is.

851
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:05,708
My beautiful bride.

852
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:10,958
You're perfect.

853
01:12:24,833 --> 01:12:28,125
- No.
- Jennifer, don't let go.

854
01:12:29,458 --> 01:12:31,791
Rollins!

855
01:12:35,333 --> 01:12:36,375
Jenn!

856
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:38,833
Rollins! Rollins, I'm in here.

857
01:12:38,916 --> 01:12:41,416
- Where is he?
- He went out the back.

858
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:44,125
- I'm trapped. You have to help me.
- The door is locked.

859
01:12:48,333 --> 01:12:50,458
Jenn, listen to me.

860
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:53,333
I have to go find him.
You're gonna be okay.

861
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:55,500
What? No, no, no! Rollins, no!

862
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:58,708
Please don't go!
You can't go! Please don't go!

863
01:13:15,833 --> 01:13:18,875
Okay. Come on.
Just focus. Focus.

864
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:46,250
I'm okay. I'm okay.

865
01:15:22,125 --> 01:15:23,208
Rollins!

866
01:15:23,708 --> 01:15:25,583
Jenn, the gun!

867
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:28,166
Jennifer, sleep!

868
01:16:11,666 --> 01:16:14,041
Jenn? Jenn?

869
01:16:14,125 --> 01:16:16,708
It's Rollins. Wake up, Jenn.

870
01:16:17,208 --> 01:16:19,958
That's it, wake up. That's it. No.

871
01:16:20,041 --> 01:16:21,291
- You're okay.
- No.

872
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,708
- Where is he? Where is he?
- He's gone.

873
01:16:24,166 --> 01:16:25,916
It's over. You're okay.

874
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:28,875
I called in for backup.
They'll be here shortly.

875
01:16:31,125 --> 01:16:32,208
You're okay.

876
01:16:33,166 --> 01:16:34,166
You're...

877
01:16:34,541 --> 01:16:36,000
You're a good shot.

878
01:16:38,541 --> 01:16:40,041
- Oh, sorry.
- It's okay.

879
01:16:50,125 --> 01:16:51,291
- Here.
- Thank you.

880
01:16:51,791 --> 01:16:54,833
Here. Here.

881
01:16:58,041 --> 01:16:59,458
You're gonna be fine.

882
01:17:02,375 --> 01:17:03,875
I promise, my love.

883
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:11,166
<i>Jenn.</i>

884
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:14,583
In the recording you played me,

885
01:17:15,291 --> 01:17:18,208
Dr. Meade called you "my love."

886
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:20,291
<i>Thank you for being honest, my love.</i>

887
01:17:20,916 --> 01:17:24,875
If you are ever
under a post-hypnotic suggestion

888
01:17:24,958 --> 01:17:30,583
by Dr. Collin Meade,
and he refers to you as "my love,"

889
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:33,708
you will ignore

890
01:17:33,791 --> 01:17:37,416
every single trigger
he put into your head.

891
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,791
And you will see the world around you

892
01:17:40,875 --> 01:17:42,791
for what it truly is.

893
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,125
Meade?

894
01:17:55,208 --> 01:17:56,875
I'm not your love.

895
01:18:00,291 --> 01:18:02,791
- No!
- No, no, no.

896
01:18:12,041 --> 01:18:13,500
Rollins.

897
01:18:13,583 --> 01:18:15,625
Oh my God! Oh God.

898
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:18,333
Hey, hey! Wake up. Please wake up.

899
01:18:22,416 --> 01:18:24,458
- Come on.
- Ankle.

900
01:18:25,166 --> 01:18:26,166
What?

901
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,041
Jennifer!

902
01:18:28,125 --> 01:18:29,291
Ankle.

903
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:32,875
Come here!

904
01:18:54,041 --> 01:18:54,875
Hey.

905
01:18:54,958 --> 01:18:57,291
No, no, no! Hey, hey, hey! Hi.

906
01:18:57,375 --> 01:18:59,208
Right here. Look at me, look at me.

907
01:18:59,291 --> 01:19:01,166
Look at me, look at me. Yes.

908
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:03,541
Hi, hi! You're okay, you're okay.

909
01:19:04,125 --> 01:19:06,458
- You shot me.
- I'm sorry.

910
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:10,875
Stay... Yeah. Stay with me. Hi.
You're okay. You're gonna be okay.

911
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:14,125
Stay with me, okay?

912
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:18,708
I can hear them. I hear sirens.
They are coming. It's okay.

913
01:19:18,791 --> 01:19:21,208
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

914
01:19:46,541 --> 01:19:49,500
I think it's great. We present it
to the team at Monday's meeting.

915
01:19:49,583 --> 01:19:51,000
But I'm a huge fan.

916
01:19:51,958 --> 01:19:53,708
Uh-huh. Great work, Tiff.

917
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:55,916
Yeah, I'll see you then.

918
01:20:02,083 --> 01:20:04,041
<i>I'm definitely moving.</i>

919
01:20:04,875 --> 01:20:07,625
You'll like the new place.
You don't have to. I understand.

920
01:20:07,708 --> 01:20:09,875
I know you're very particular
about your things.

921
01:20:16,041 --> 01:20:17,208
I'm sorry.

922
01:20:19,458 --> 01:20:20,958
I'm sorry I left.

923
01:20:23,333 --> 01:20:25,708
I'm sorry
I didn't share my grief with you.

924
01:20:27,708 --> 01:20:31,000
I'm sorry that I thought losing Daniel

925
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:33,583
was harder for me than it was for you.

926
01:20:34,166 --> 01:20:36,500
And I know it's not my fault
what happened to him.

927
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:38,916
No matter how much I wanna blame myself.

928
01:20:43,333 --> 01:20:47,375
But it is my fault what happened to us.

929
01:20:51,708 --> 01:20:54,125
And for that, I'm really, truly sorry.

930
01:21:03,708 --> 01:21:05,791
The doctors say your tests are promising.

931
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:07,833
That's really good news.

932
01:21:09,708 --> 01:21:12,250
And when you wake up,
I'll be sitting right here.

933
01:21:27,791 --> 01:21:30,041
My condolences on your promotion.

934
01:21:30,708 --> 01:21:32,166
I'm regretting it already.

935
01:21:32,708 --> 01:21:36,750
I left you alone,
but I did wanna say thank you

936
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:38,291
for everything.

937
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:41,875
I wasn't sure when I'd see you again, but...

938
01:21:43,416 --> 01:21:45,375
I figured you'd come around eventually.

939
01:21:47,375 --> 01:21:49,041
A token of my appreciation.

940
01:21:50,875 --> 01:21:52,291
Take care of yourself, yeah?

941
01:22:20,333 --> 01:22:21,416
Well played.

942
01:22:22,305 --> 01:23:22,868
