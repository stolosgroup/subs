1
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:29,194
And as such this episode of
"Permanent Residents" comes to an end.

2
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,531
We hope you've enjoyed it and can now
make your own mental picture of Brazil.

3
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,701
As you all know by now we don't just
visit countries: we live there,

4
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,836
immersing ourselves
deep into the culture

5
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:40,539
and making bonds with people
who are sometimes indefectible.

6
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,809
Our next trip will take us to
the mythical city of Casablanca,

7
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:46,412
home of the legendary
Rick's Café.

8
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:48,680
Helen, are you okay?

9
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:51,683
Wait, wait here.

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,567
This is fucking awesome!

11
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,110
This little fucker is fast.

12
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,088
I hate that I have to be so rough with you,
baby, I really do.

13
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,090
But there's nothing else
I can do.

14
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:50,876
Give me the phone.
What are you doing?

15
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:54,246
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Put down the knife and give me the phone.

16
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:57,382
Jesus! Calm down!
Do you speak English?

17
00:01:57,384 --> 00:02:00,185
Dude, stop it.
Do you speak English? English?

18
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:01,620
Calm down and give me the phone.

19
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,355
Is this your... is this your son?

20
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,395
He stole my partner's phone.

21
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:11,930
Can I get the phone back,
please?

22
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,134
That's just the camera guy.
Don't worry about him.

23
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:16,301
My present.

24
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,536
- What?
- My present.

25
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:19,238
I think he wants the camera.

26
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,873
- Give it to him.
- He's not getting my camera.

27
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,308
- This guy's not kidding, man.
- Neither am I.

28
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,455
- I'm not giving him my camera.
- Give him the fucking camera.

29
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,439
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

30
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:29,982
Don't fuck with me right now.

31
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,943
I'll break your fucking legs.
Give him the camera!

32
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:35,487
Give him the fucking camera.

33
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,689
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

34
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:46,899
- You guys get out of here.
- Just be careful.

35
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:48,901
- Just get the fuck out of here.
- Careful with it.

36
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,570
Get out what here?

37
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:58,277
Okay, look.

38
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,878
I just need to get
that memory card back.

39
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,317
I need the SD card back.

40
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,690
It has all my work on it.
It's how I make a living.

41
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:13,458
Me and the other two guys.

42
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,473
- You okay?
- Not really.

43
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,408
Why what's up?

44
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,643
The numbers are down.

45
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,545
What are we at?

46
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:43,949
- 1.2 million views.
- That's pretty good.

47
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,084
What? Viral is a million.

48
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:50,289
That's twenty-six percent lower
than our South African episode.

49
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,791
Don't worry. Morocco is gonna be
good. It's gonna be kick-ass.

50
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:56,428
- The audience just wants more.
- More what?

51
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,929
We almost died
three times in Brazil.

52
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,399
Maybe they want to see us die.

53
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,835
I can't stand it
when you think like that, Einar.

54
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,105
I think the audience just wants
to root for us more.

55
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,842
I think they want to be able to
see through us more, you know.

56
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,878
Maybe we just haven't shown them
who we really are.

57
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,120
Like Einar jerking off
in the middle of the night?

58
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:19,785
Or you filming yourself taking a piss,
realizing you have no dick?

59
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:21,787
Exactly, guys.

60
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:23,822
Oh fuck you, buddy.

61
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,358
- Oh, fuck you!
- No, fuck you.

62
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,528
- Wait! Do you have a problem?
- Yes, I have a problem.

63
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,463
How could you run off
filming that take

64
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:34,633
- when Helen was on the ground?
- I checked. She was fine.

65
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,601
- She was on the ground, hurt.
- I know.

66
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,337
- You checked?
- I checked. She was fine.

67
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,072
- I checked.
- Yes, then I ran.

68
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:42,774
- Selfish motherfucker.
- Wait, what? What did you say?

69
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,910
Motherfucker. Do you want
me to spell it out for you?

70
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:48,980
- I would love it if you did.
- Helen, please.

71
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,816
Can you keep this guy
away from me?

72
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,584
Turn around
and mind your business.

73
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,586
- ...E-R.
- Can you just keep away from me?

74
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,588
- Can you?
- What are you doing?

75
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,423
- Einar?
- What am I doing?

76
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,525
I'm confiscating
your penis extension.

77
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,160
- Uh, that's...
- Hey, driver.

78
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,763
- Could you open the window?
- Gentlemen.

79
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:08,500
What are you doing?
What are you doing? I got it.

80
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:10,569
- Einar.
- Okay, just give it back.

81
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,451
Is this the... is this the place?

82
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:00,852
I'm so hungry.
You guys starving?

83
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:03,155
I would kill
for a cup of coffee.

84
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:04,823
Kill for a cup of coffee?

85
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,426
Do you mean like literally
murder somebody?

86
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:08,794
I'd murder you
for a cup of coffee.

87
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,429
That's very rude.

88
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,731
I expect an apology
like right now.

89
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,767
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

90
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,936
When was the first time
you did crack?

91
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:22,474
Hi.
"Permanent Residents," Helen.

92
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:24,576
- Mrs. Frangier.
- Come in, dear.

93
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:27,579
- Come in, all of you.
- Thank you.

94
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:30,048
- Hello, hello.
- Hi.

95
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,118
This is awesome.

96
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,053
How many cats
are around here?

97
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:41,159
Helen, you look
exactly like in your program.

98
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,662
- You watch our show?
- Of course.

99
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:47,265
That episode in Guatemala,
where you got abducted by these drug lords

100
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,534
- was so uplifting.
- Thank you.

101
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,770
- Did you rate us?
- Sorry?

102
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:53,004
Did you write a good comment?

103
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,540
- Oh yes, always.
- Awesome.

104
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:57,909
Come in, dear.

105
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,244
Come in all of you.

106
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,280
- Welcome.
- Wow!

107
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,917
- This place is awesome, Mrs. Frangier.
- Thank you.

108
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,054
- Your Airbnb didn't lie.
- Why would it?

109
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:12,557
Sometimes people like to make their
houses look better than in real life.

110
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,995
Helen.
Oh, I love the banister.

111
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:21,967
I love the pendant you're wearing.
Where did you get it?

112
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:25,537
- A cabbalist gave it to me on a trip to Chile.
- What's inside?

113
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:29,307
Writings to protect
from evil spirits.

114
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:34,045
- You believe in spirits?
- So, why so cheap?

115
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:38,650
Ah, Daniel liked the house
being filled with life.

116
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:41,186
- Who's Daniel?
- My son.

117
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,657
Oh, yeah,
this is my room.

118
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,792
Definitely, a panic room.

119
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:51,730
The poor woman went
cuckoo after her husband passed away.

120
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:54,933
Don't be alarmed if she pops in
once in a while.

121
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,835
She is totally harmless.

122
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:58,703
What did you say her name was?

123
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:02,040
Mancherbruuk.
Her name is Mancherbruuk.

124
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,343
You can't miss her.
Her hell is contagious.

125
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:07,547
Oh what is this?

126
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:11,082
What is that broken frame?

127
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,951
All right.

128
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:17,589
Oh, ooh! I look so good,
don't you think?

129
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,658
You look awesome.

130
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:21,761
Mm.

131
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:29,668
What is this? A little foursome?

132
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,269
That's fun.

133
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:46,351
New room, new stuff.

134
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,053
Why are flies here?

135
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,756
One, two, three.

136
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,598
Come on, head,
pop up to me, will you?

137
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Don't be afraid to be cliché.

138
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,935
Come on,
jump scares always work.

139
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,272
What the hell is that thing?

140
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:16,147
I got a miniature plant.

141
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,983
Oh, this is so cool.

142
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:20,986
Danger sign.

143
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:23,321
Something I can help you with,
young man?

144
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:24,956
Um... What's in there?

145
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,891
Ah, the motor room.

146
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,995
I had a little problem
with the electricity company.

147
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:31,363
Oh, I see.

148
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:34,165
You remind me of him a little.

149
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,701
You remind me of my son, Daniel.

150
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:39,037
You must have
a very beautiful soul.

151
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,172
I don't know. All I really
checked was my bladder.

152
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,241
You're so cute.

153
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:46,077
You're cute, too.

154
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,979
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

155
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,882
Well, boys. I leave you here.

156
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:53,251
I wish you a beautiful stay.

157
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,854
Anything you need
my number is on the fridge.

158
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:56,988
Thank you.

159
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:01,292
I am very happy
to have all of you here.

160
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,895
I really am.

161
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,667
Uh, I can't stand the sound
of that motor.

162
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,775
Have you ever made out
with a sixty-year-old before?

163
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:21,246
- No.
- 'Cause I almost did

164
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:25,050
and I have a feeling it would
have been awesome. So...

165
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,854
- Okay.
- Maybe we should put you in there.

166
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,924
What's? What? So rude.

167
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:17,836
You want a reaction shot
of me like closing this?

168
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:21,106
- Mm-hm.
- Okay. All right.

169
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:24,175
Here we are standing outside
of the old slaughterhouse.

170
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,845
Another example of the strong
heritage left behind

171
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,446
by the French
colonization period.

172
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,482
You can also notice
the architecture

173
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:32,484
is reminiscent
of the Art Deco movement

174
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:36,020
with vertical lines, abstract
shapes, and high moldings.

175
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,058
If you take a look around,
you can also see the place is a ghost town

176
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,393
and that's because of the
mysterious superstitious beliefs

177
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,796
held by the people
of Casablanca.

178
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:47,532
We're gonna take you inside and find
out what people are so afraid of.

179
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,300
So follow me
and let's go take a look.

180
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,245
- Hey, what?
- Sir, we have...

181
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,884
Oh, and here's
another police truck.

182
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:09,053
God, it seems like everywhere
we go, they...

183
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:15,160
these people are always present
for some obscure reason.

184
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,595
I know.
Just very, very reassuring.

185
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:22,500
Very reassuring.
What's up? You, okay?

186
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,170
I have a bad feeling
about this city.

187
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:29,274
We were shooting without a permit.
It could have happened anywhere.

188
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:32,510
- No, it's not the slaughter house incident.
- What then?

189
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:37,816
Just getting bad vibes.
Bad omen.

190
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:40,285
- Hello.
- It's real.

191
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:41,619
Oh, wow.
What do you got there?

192
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,558
- I like the purple.
- A very nice color.

193
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,159
- Can I see this?
- Yes. Yes.

194
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,362
Awesome. Thank you.

195
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:56,401
Wow. I like this. How much?

196
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:59,404
- Three hundred.
- Uh, three hundred?

197
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,473
Uh, how about two hundred?

198
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,008
- Two?
- Two hundred.

199
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,844
- It's okay.
- All right.

200
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,912
I can do that.

201
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:09,614
- Thanks.
- Bye.

202
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:12,317
- Wait. How much?
- Two hundred dirhams.

203
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:16,221
He said three hundred but he
gave it to me for two hundred.

204
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:19,257
- It's like twenty dollars.
- I don't remember the conversion.

205
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,526
It's like ten dollars is...

206
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,662
No ten dirhams
is one dollar, so...

207
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,531
He said @@
is what you should pay.

208
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:30,635
You better read up.
Get a guide next time you shop.

209
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:33,071
Fifteen dirhams?
Oh my God! Thank you.

210
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,540
- I knew it.
- We should thank him.

211
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,570
We just got invited
to a wedding.

212
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:09,274
- Awesome.
- You got invited to a wedding.

213
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:12,377
No. You, Mark and I.

214
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:15,146
That's ridiculous.
You didn't even know the guy.

215
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,415
Well,
he just saved me 200 dirhams.

216
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,384
- Seems like a nice guy.
- Well, 150.

217
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:22,487
That's like the beginning
of a horror movie or something.

218
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,460
Silence
is all there is right now.

219
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,666
The moonlight barely touches
the clay walls in here.

220
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:39,604
Helen is upstairs
making herself look pretty.

221
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,473
And Einar
is masturbating insatiably.

222
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:46,444
So, where does that leave me?

223
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:53,584
You want a little back-story
on Mark Dole.

224
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,119
I am Mark Dole.

225
00:15:55,121 --> 00:16:00,491
Am I meant to do this permanent
resident stuff for the rest of my life

226
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:03,561
or am I meant to be
an actual filmmaker?

227
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,665
I don't know.

228
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:13,304
I don't know.
Maybe I'm meant to lose.

229
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:19,510
You know in the end,
everyone loses.

230
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:23,047
- Mark.
- Oh, hey. In here.

231
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,283
- You ready?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

232
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,118
- We better get going.
- Wow! You look...

233
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,188
You look really beautiful.

234
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,024
- You like?
- Yeah, just stunning.

235
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:35,193
- Thank you.
- Wow!

236
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:37,495
- I wore this just for you.
- Did you?

237
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,464
- I did.
- Really? No way.

238
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:42,166
Well, how do you know
I love purple?

239
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,202
- Man, tattoos.
- Well, I took a wild guess.

240
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,637
- You like that?
- The tattoos? I do.

241
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,439
Right on.

242
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:51,442
- Ready to have some fun tonight?
- Yes, yes, yes.

243
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,311
- Like that?
- Oh, boob shot.

244
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:55,013
- You got a zoom shot?
- Oh perfect.

245
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,447
- Zooming in the zone.
- Here one more.

246
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,349
- Oh, here we go.
- Get that close up.

247
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,118
- I know you want it.
- I do.

248
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,652
- There we go.
- Well, if you come out,

249
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:04,188
we can dance
may be naked tonight.

250
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:06,657
- Oh! Okay.
- Hey!

251
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:12,363
I'll be outside.

252
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:18,503
- Come on, Mark, let's go.
- Oh... Okay. Oh...

253
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:24,342
Wow! That is officially weird.

254
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,316
Finally a night out.

255
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:34,552
- That's gonna be awesome.
- Yeah.

256
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:39,090
Yeah. It's nice to actually
get to see the city, you know.

257
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:43,261
Yeah, just do something
fun rather than, you know...

258
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:46,364
- Sit around and jerk off whole day?
- Yeah. Wait.

259
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:49,067
Some of us
actually try to work.

260
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,235
True.

261
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,505
Yeah, this is a beautiful city.

262
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:57,442
- So sweet.
- Thank you so much.

263
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:01,579
It's nothing.
It's really my pleasure.

264
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,283
So how long
have you been a guide?

265
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:07,485
Thirty-one years.

266
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,721
I started
when I was nine years old.

267
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:16,527
Yeah, as a kid my parents
could not afford school.

268
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:17,695
So I had to work.

269
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:22,800
I would walk to the main square,
walk up to people,

270
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:25,570
offer to take them places.

271
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:29,340
I really started enjoying it.
You know,

272
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:33,744
the exchange with people,
the encounters, it became my life.

273
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:37,515
How about you?
How did you all become vloggers?

274
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:41,486
- That's a really long story.
- Oh yeah!

275
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:45,323
It's actually only temporary
or I mean for me at least.

276
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:49,293
- Oh really? How's that?
- I'm gonna make movies.

277
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:54,732
- Movies? As in Hollywood movies?
- I'm in Nahor.

278
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,268
I'm gonna make the ultimate
found-footage horror flick.

279
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,839
- It's gonna be awesome.
- What's found-footage?

280
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:06,244
It means the filmmakers die and the footage
is found. It's really an overused genre.

281
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:10,248
Okay, you're jealous because I
actually have a passion and you don't.

282
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,417
I don't need a passion, okay?
I need money.

283
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,820
And so do you in case you forgot
your eviction notice.

284
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,223
Can we not do this right now?

285
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:23,327
Never mind them.

286
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:25,264
They're in love.

287
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:27,365
They just don't know it yet.

288
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,267
Totally.

289
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:43,181
- So, how far is this wedding?
- We will be there soon.

290
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:47,752
- Soon as in how soon?
- About fifteen minutes.

291
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:53,958
- You said that 15 minutes ago.
- Sorry?

292
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,761
I said, you said 15 minutes
15 minutes ago.

293
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:58,796
We've been on the road
for like half an hour.

294
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:03,634
As you can see there's
a lot of traffic today.

295
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,904
- Stop the fucking car.
- Why are you doing this?

296
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,606
Ha, ha, ha,
you think this is a joke?

297
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:46,310
- Stop. What are you doing?
- Get out of the car.

298
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:49,513
Get out of the fucking car, now.
Come on stop being so naive. This is a setup.

299
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:52,984
- What's wrong with you my friend?
- Get the fuck back in the car.

300
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:55,653
- Who are the organs for, huh?
- Einar, calm down!

301
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:58,656
- You trust this guy?
- Dude, just calm down.

302
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:01,392
- Do you have a gun?
- Why are you acting like an asshole? Calm down.

303
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:03,794
I have no guns. Let me show you.
Let me show you.

304
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:07,598
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Just my guide card.

305
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,268
Let me show you
my guide card, okay?

306
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,504
- Say again?
- You can see it's real.

307
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:17,608
- You're really a fucking guide?
- Yeah, I told you before.

308
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:21,812
- Okay, my friend.
- Einar, calm down, man.

309
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:23,481
You need to calm
the fuck down, all right?

310
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:25,916
Oh me, I'm okay.
Is he okay, your friend?

311
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:27,878
- I don't know.
- I don't hear you.

312
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:34,692
- Apologize to him.
- Okay. It's no problem. No problem.

313
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:37,395
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- Okay. It's okay.

314
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:40,064
- You need to see a doctor.
- What else do you want me to do? Suck his dick?

315
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:42,500
No, I want you to get
some fucking help. You're sick.

316
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:45,036
Please get in the car.
We're gonna be late for my niece's wedding.

317
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:46,937
Okay, it's no problem.

318
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,506
Okay. It's okay.

319
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:53,764
- Still nothing?
- No. Still dark.

320
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,966
Fuck! How is that possible?

321
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:59,470
You tell me. You're the one
handling the camera.

322
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:03,808
I already told you the image
distorted, the LEDs went crazy.

323
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:08,045
Oh and it burned my hand.
Do you think that's bad?

324
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:13,250
Bad, no. I think it's great. I mean,
we don't have a picture but that's just fine.

325
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:17,521
At least we have sound. We can use that on the...
you know air that on the radio or something.

326
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:20,224
Dude, you're acting like
it's my fault it even happened.

327
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:22,993
I told you I dropped it
because the camera got hot.

328
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:25,663
Well just try it again.

329
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:28,699
I tried twelve times already.

330
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:32,536
Oh that's nice.

331
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:34,171
Are you fucking watching
porn right now?

332
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:36,173
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Wait! Dude.

333
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:38,576
- It's working.
- What? Are you serious?

334
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:40,511
- Yeah.
- I told you. Told you...

335
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:42,046
Fucked up.

336
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,682
What was that?

337
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:47,785
It's Helen. I think she's sick.

338
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:50,554
Helen.

339
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,863
Helen!

340
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,301
Are you okay?

341
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,590
What's going on Einar?

342
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:29,193
You're not as jovial
as you usually are.

343
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:32,129
Mark, I checked
the Office of Tourism.

344
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:34,798
There is no Tareek Kaleem
listed as a tour guide.

345
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:40,304
Oh, okay. So just because he's
not listed as an official tour guide

346
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:42,540
doesn't mean
he's not a tour guide.

347
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:45,910
I mean it's freelance work.
It's kind of like what we do.

348
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,579
Kind of do our own thing.

349
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:52,249
And what's the problem?

350
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,889
I'm ready, guys.

351
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:04,828
Here we are standing outside the second
largest mosque in the world, Hassan II.

352
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:10,367
This is the large... this is... All right,
guys, you rolling? Let's do this for real.

353
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,004
- Are you ready?
- Here we are standing outside

354
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:15,873
the second largest mosque
in the world,

355
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:18,142
Hassan II.
This is a major day of worship

356
00:26:18,144 --> 00:26:21,345
on Fridays
for the predominantly new...

357
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:23,280
Cut let's do that again.

358
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:24,582
Here we are standing out...

359
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,385
Mom.

360
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:30,054
Oh, no.

361
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:31,622
She's on the phone
with her mom.

362
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:34,191
I sent you money before I left.

363
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,963
She is not happy.

364
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:44,068
Yeah, mom.
Are you drinking again?

365
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:49,306
I would have given you a little
more back-story on Einar but it's...

366
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:53,210
it's pretty blue, pretty sad.
Hey, man! What's up? You okay?

367
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:58,749
What the fuck?

368
00:27:05,358 --> 00:27:07,391
Crazy fucking bitch!

369
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:09,360
What's going on?
Talk to me, man.

370
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:13,430
It's... it's just a nosebleed.
That's it.

371
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:17,668
It could be the climate change.
The jet lag. I don't know.

372
00:27:22,842 --> 00:27:26,443
Fuck you, Mom!
You fucking bitch.

373
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:28,312
You stupid fucking whore.

374
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:31,982
You're the fucking whore, Mom.

375
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,053
Me, I just like fucking pussy.

376
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:26,170
Helen, where's your necklace?

377
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:30,741
I must have dropped it.

378
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:04,441
Could you stop filming
for one second?

379
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:08,278
No, no,
this anger is like perfect.

380
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:12,483
You need to listen to this.

381
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:15,786
- What is this?
- I got it translated.

382
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,167
What is that?

383
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:34,505
That Arabic she's speaking.
That's not just plain Arabic.

384
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:39,209
That's an ancient dialect
spoken by mythological figures

385
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:42,112
during the Arabic crusade
against the Christian invasion.

386
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,782
So, what are you saying?

387
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,784
I'm saying,
the language she's speaking,

388
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:49,953
it's the language
of the Jinn.

389
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,822
Oh, what is the Jinn?

390
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:56,994
It's the Arab word for demon.

391
00:29:56,996 --> 00:30:00,931
Okay. So you're saying that woman
we hear speaking in the background

392
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:02,466
is actually invoking demons?

393
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:06,036
Not just any demon; the demon.

394
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:08,372
Oh! That was good.
That was good.

395
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:11,241
Okay, can we step back and do
it again, I think we could...

396
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:13,844
- Do you think it's a joke?
- No.

397
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:16,580
I think you should take a shower
and drink some milk.

398
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:18,582
Find all the milk you can
and just drink it

399
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:22,519
because this hashish you're on
right now, it's a lot.

400
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:25,155
You're a little much.
It's gonna work great.

401
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:28,892
It's gonna work great
with this but um, I'm gonna go.

402
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:30,994
I'm telling you,
don't go up there.

403
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:50,574
Good morning, sweetheart.
How'd you sleep?

404
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:56,647
I slept fine.
Thanks for asking. And you?

405
00:31:58,484 --> 00:32:02,185
Slept good. Slept good.

406
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:16,667
What is this?

407
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:23,941
"Not able to get Tareek on
phone. This is freaking me out.

408
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:25,709
Going to town.
Be back soon. Einar."

409
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:29,746
Okay, looks like Einar went
on another paranoia spree.

410
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:31,415
That was to be expected.

411
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,417
What is this?

412
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,090
Shit!

413
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:29,239
Oh my god! Oh my god!

414
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:31,208
What the fuck? Mark.

415
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,043
Mark, are you okay?

416
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:34,411
- Wake up. Are you okay?
- What?

417
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:35,812
- What happened?
- I don't know.

418
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:38,281
You're lying in blood.
Get up.

419
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:40,817
- Whose fucking blood is this?
- I don't know.

420
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:43,120
- What do you mean you don't know?
- I don't know!

421
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:44,654
I just woke up! I don't know!

422
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:46,390
- Helen!
- Oh my god.

423
00:33:46,392 --> 00:33:48,291
- Helen!
- What the fuck are you doing?

424
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:51,728
Where are you going?
Oh my god. I don't... oh fuck!

425
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,363
- Where is Helen?
- I don't know.

426
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,499
What the fuck
did you do to Helen?

427
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:57,167
Oh god! You're an asshole.

428
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:59,469
- I'm the asshole?
- Shit!

429
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:03,273
Oh my god! Is that like a...
did you punch me?

430
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:07,344
- Oh! Was that a slap? God! Oh!
- Fuck!

431
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:09,346
The battery is dead.
We got to recharge it.

432
00:34:09,348 --> 00:34:12,516
- Son of a bitch, Einar. Fuck!
- Fuck!

433
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:15,719
What the fuck is going on?
What the fuck?

434
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,456
Oh shit! Um...

435
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:23,326
Hey, Einar,
can I get my camera back?

436
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:26,696
We've got some blood up here,
I'd like to film. Come on.

437
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:31,435
Ah! Einar,
do you have my camera?

438
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,145
- She's still in the house.
- Really?

439
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,715
- We'll talk to her.
- No, no. Wait. Just wait.

440
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:48,785
What are you doing? No. she's
bathing in her own period blood.

441
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:50,687
- We gotta clean her up.
- No. It's not her period.

442
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:52,556
No, it is.
I'm going to go clean...

443
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:55,892
- Can you sit down for one moment?
- Okay, fine.

444
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:58,228
- I need to talk to you.
- Okay.

445
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:04,301
- What?
- Remember that case I told you about?

446
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:06,470
About the mass hysteria
that happened in our school

447
00:35:06,472 --> 00:35:09,639
- that me and Helen went to?
- Yeah.

448
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,775
That wasn't a case
of mass hysteria.

449
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:16,313
That was a case
of mass demonic possession.

450
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:22,152
It was the first ever recorded mass
demonic possession involving children.

451
00:35:22,154 --> 00:35:25,655
- What are you talking about?
- There was this guy, Michael Winkler.

452
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:29,426
He was a para-psychologist
who was investigating the case.

453
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:33,363
He found out that kids
were playing this game

454
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:36,466
that invoked demonic spirits.

455
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:39,936
Twenty children ended up
in the hospital, Mark.

456
00:35:41,507 --> 00:35:43,840
Only eight of them got affected

457
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:47,244
but Helen was one
of those eight children.

458
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,347
So now you're keeping
secrets from me?

459
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:51,882
I couldn't.
I couldn't tell you before.

460
00:35:51,884 --> 00:35:54,484
There was this intense pressure

461
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,887
from the church,
from everybody involved.

462
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:59,656
We all swore to secrecy, okay.

463
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:03,193
We promised
that we wouldn't talk about it.

464
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:06,363
I promised. I promised Helen.

465
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:08,465
- Really?
- Yes.

466
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:12,636
- And why are you telling me now?
- I'm telling you now because...

467
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:18,542
Helen is possessed, Mark.

468
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:21,878
That's not a wedding.
That's satanic ritual.

469
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:27,484
- Bullshit!
- This is not something you want to see.

470
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:29,653
- Shut the fuck up.
- This...

471
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:47,771
Right there, stop. Rewind.

472
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:51,374
Go back a few frames.

473
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,010
Wait, zoom in.

474
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:55,512
There, right there.

475
00:36:55,514 --> 00:36:57,214
Oh shit!

476
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:11,361
Mark, I know you're there @@.

477
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:18,435
Marky, boy. I know
you wanna fuck me. Come on.

478
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:37,287
Run, run!

479
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:43,026
We need to fucking hide.
We need to hide. Come on.

480
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:44,861
So?

481
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:46,429
What the hell?

482
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:05,048
Okay. I think she's gone.

483
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:10,687
You know how in those
found-footage movies

484
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:14,758
they always get the camera and face
it to the actors for no reason?

485
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,961
Yeah why?
I just did that.

486
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:20,330
What do you think?

487
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:23,533
Found-footage is dead, okay.
I already told you.

488
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:25,335
We got a real problem here.

489
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:26,870
- Okay.
- Helen is possessed.

490
00:38:27,773 --> 00:38:29,406
We just need to figure out
what to do.

491
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:31,041
This is bad. This is bad.

492
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:33,810
This is a bad demon.

493
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,378
This is not good.

494
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:38,982
This is a bad demon.

495
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:41,584
How did we get into this?

496
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:44,020
You know I'm starting to think

497
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:46,723
that guy wasn't
that crazy after all.

498
00:38:46,725 --> 00:38:50,126
- What are you talking about?
- I didn't tell you?

499
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:53,396
- No.
- While I was out there looking for Tareek,

500
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,933
this guy was on the street,

501
00:38:56,935 --> 00:39:00,136
dancing like a lunatic,
screaming,

502
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:03,807
singing this eerie song.

503
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:06,710
I didn't understand it but then
this lady translated it.

504
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:13,750
It was saying things
about this place, Booyah.

505
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:18,121
He was saying it's like
a prison with no bars...

506
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:22,025
like people
don't want to escape.

507
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:26,062
Like there are not gates
but no one ever escapes.

508
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:30,033
He was saying the possessed are
everywhere roaming the streets at night

509
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:34,137
and the government will
find you and will grab you

510
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:37,841
and throw you into Booyah
if you get possessed I mean.

511
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:43,546
Wait a second. You're saying
that this Booyah place is real?

512
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:46,916
Is a real place?
You know, like Area 51?

513
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:50,720
I'm not saying that. I'm just saying
what this guy was singing about.

514
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,489
Jeez.

515
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:56,393
Look, we got this. Okay.

516
00:39:56,395 --> 00:39:58,061
Look at me. We got this.

517
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:00,096
- We got this. You got this.
- We got this.

518
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:07,170
- Dude, I told you, don't go in.
- I'm gonna be fine.

519
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,707
- Be careful.
- Okay.

520
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,988
I don't know. She must
have jumped out of the window.

521
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,423
This can't be.

522
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:29,225
Mark, step out of the bathroom

523
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:32,128
really, really slowly.

524
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,608
Mark!

525
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:32,822
Come on, man!

526
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:40,029
- Ah!
- Are you okay?

527
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:54,143
Come on. Come on, come on.
Don't die on me. Please don't die on me.

528
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:57,514
Please. Please, don't die on me.
Oh, come on.

529
00:41:57,516 --> 00:41:59,782
- Fuck!
- What?

530
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:01,818
I'm trying to bring her
back to life.

531
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,854
My camera.
I'm nothing without my camera.

532
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:07,090
- Mark, look at me.
- No.

533
00:42:07,092 --> 00:42:08,558
- Look at me.
- No.

534
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,792
- Look at me.
- No.

535
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:11,928
I'm not looking at you.

536
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:14,931
Mark, Helen is possessed.

537
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:20,803
Look at me. Possession
as in horror movies. Understand?

538
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:22,639
We're gonna wake up
from this soon, right?

539
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:24,641
This is just one nightmare,
I'm gonna wake up.

540
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:26,709
You're, she and the camera
are going to wake up

541
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,645
and everything's gonna be fine.

542
00:42:28,647 --> 00:42:30,213
We need to call Frangier,
the embassy.

543
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:33,049
- We need to call people.
- Listen to me.

544
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,552
Listen to me.
We can't call anybody.

545
00:42:35,554 --> 00:42:38,621
The minute we call somebody,
they'll come here, grab Helen

546
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:41,224
and throw her into Booyah
for the rest of her life.

547
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:42,759
Booyah doesn't exist, man.

548
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:44,794
You bet your life on it. Huh?

549
00:42:44,796 --> 00:42:49,299
The government has night
brigades patrolling the streets,

550
00:42:49,301 --> 00:42:51,634
looking for possessed people.
Okay?

551
00:42:51,636 --> 00:42:54,270
They're going to come here.
They're going to find Helen

552
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:57,807
and they're going to throw her
in that godforsaken place

553
00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:00,376
for the rest of her fucking
life. Is that what you want?

554
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:02,312
Huh? Is that what you want?

555
00:43:02,314 --> 00:43:06,082
What? What are we going to do?
What are we going to do?

556
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:11,721
I don't know. Just let me think.
Let me think.

557
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:18,294
Okay. Okay, I got it.

558
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:21,331
You've seen every single
possession movie there is, right?

559
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:23,633
- Why? Why this...
- Just answer my question.

560
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:27,070
I don't know. I think I missed
some of the Serbian ones.

561
00:43:27,072 --> 00:43:29,105
I don't know. Why?

562
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:31,874
No.

563
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:34,410
No. Einar we are not doing that.

564
00:43:34,412 --> 00:43:36,145
No.

565
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,015
Shit. Shit.

566
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:49,258
- What do you think?
- I think it'll work.

567
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,694
- What else?
- Um, boiling water.

568
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:53,129
- Got it.
- Salt?

569
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:55,264
- Yes, salt.
- Cool. I think that's it.

570
00:43:55,266 --> 00:43:56,399
What about a spell?

571
00:43:56,401 --> 00:43:58,401
Oh, yeah, just say like,

572
00:43:58,403 --> 00:44:00,403
"The power of Christ compels
you a couple of times."

573
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:02,939
About 99 times would be fine.

574
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:19,389
I love staring
at empty refrigerators.

575
00:44:22,293 --> 00:44:26,029
When I was a kid, I'd imagine
they were full of ice cream.

576
00:44:27,098 --> 00:44:30,366
I could almost smell them,
chocolate,

577
00:44:30,368 --> 00:44:33,302
strawberry, vanilla.

578
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:38,908
And then I would lick them
one by one.

579
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,021
And then I would wipe
the cream off my face.

580
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:59,875
Why did you leave
me on the side of the road, daddy?

581
00:45:00,932 --> 00:45:07,870
It was so cold
and my little body shivering.

582
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:11,208
Helen?

583
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:14,077
And you, mommy?

584
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,146
I saw you watching, mommy.

585
00:45:18,717 --> 00:45:22,785
You just stared at the long road,
disappearing in the foggy night.

586
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:28,257
They got time, daddy.

587
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:31,260
Stop! What the fuck?

588
00:45:32,464 --> 00:45:36,532
Cheesy dialogue from a cheesy
TV show I used to watch.

589
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,937
There was a lot of dead animals.

590
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:45,842
The bird. The pink bird.
The cow.

591
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:48,978
The goat.

592
00:45:53,218 --> 00:45:55,785
- What?
- What the fuck?

593
00:45:57,756 --> 00:45:59,989
Okay, we gotta go.
We gotta follow her.

594
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:01,824
Yeah, yeah.

595
00:46:01,826 --> 00:46:04,861
- Wait. You forgot something.
- What did...

596
00:46:04,863 --> 00:46:06,162
Your camera, bro.

597
00:46:06,164 --> 00:46:07,897
- Do you mean it?
- Yeah.

598
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:12,535
- I love you so much right now.
- Don't push it.

599
00:46:18,076 --> 00:46:19,842
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

600
00:46:25,517 --> 00:46:27,817
- Wait, it's not going to work.
- What? Why?

601
00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:31,254
It's a Muslim demon. It's not
gonna give a shit about Christ.

602
00:46:31,256 --> 00:46:34,090
- How do you it's a Muslim?
- It was speaking Arabic.

603
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:37,360
You're being so racist
right now. Let's go.

604
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,833
- You ready?
- Oh god!

605
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:49,505
The power of Christ compels you.
The power of Christ compels you.

606
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:54,110
The power of Christ compels you.
The power of Christ compels you.

607
00:46:54,112 --> 00:46:57,547
The power of Christ compels you.
The power of Christ compels you.

608
00:46:57,549 --> 00:47:00,283
- What are you laughing at?
- Guys, what are you doing?

609
00:47:00,285 --> 00:47:03,219
We're exorcising you, Helen.
It's for your own good.

610
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:05,054
- With that?
- What's wrong with it?

611
00:47:08,293 --> 00:47:12,295
- Want to dance, Marky boy?
- What?

612
00:47:12,297 --> 00:47:13,996
My little fuck boy.

613
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:17,633
Run, Mark.
Run, run, run, run, run.

614
00:47:17,635 --> 00:47:19,302
No. Not like this.

615
00:47:29,948 --> 00:47:32,248
<i>You want to play hide and seek?</i>

616
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:53,536
Fuck! Shit!

617
00:48:12,657 --> 00:48:18,961
<i>Ring-a-round the rosies.
A pocket full of posies. Ashes!</i>

618
00:48:21,165 --> 00:48:23,232
Fuck! Shit.

619
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:07,410
<i>What did you say her name was?</i>

620
00:49:07,412 --> 00:49:09,512
<i>Mancherbruuk.
You can't miss her.</i>

621
00:49:09,514 --> 00:49:11,247
<i>Her hell is contagious.</i>

622
00:49:15,253 --> 00:49:18,187
Hello. Oh!

623
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:19,488
Scary, yeah!

624
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:23,526
Oh nice!

625
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:25,161
Amazing.

626
00:49:27,332 --> 00:49:29,465
Blood seems to be real.

627
00:49:30,368 --> 00:49:34,370
Mmm... Yeah, a little over real.
I know.

628
00:49:34,372 --> 00:49:38,574
You know what I think? I think that
Mrs. Frangier's dark little secret

629
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:40,209
is about to be revealed.

630
00:49:40,211 --> 00:49:42,378
I have been watching movies.

631
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,313
Lot of movies.

632
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:47,450
In "Rosemary's Baby"
there is a secret passage

633
00:49:47,452 --> 00:49:50,753
connecting Rosemary's apartment
to Mrs. Castevet's.

634
00:49:50,755 --> 00:49:53,456
Therefore,
it would not surprise me

635
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:59,095
if there was a similar passage
to Daniel's room.

636
00:49:59,097 --> 00:50:00,796
If you don't mind young lady,

637
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:02,698
I am going to take a look
upstairs

638
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,067
and try to find
the secret passage.

639
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:15,311
What's going on in here?

640
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,484
Oh!

641
00:52:00,518 --> 00:52:04,386
Mark!

642
00:52:09,727 --> 00:52:11,927
- Einar, where are you?
- Mark?

643
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:14,330
Come on. Oh my god.
There you are. Hey.

644
00:52:14,332 --> 00:52:16,465
- Hey. Untie me. Untie me.
- What happened to you?

645
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:18,200
Nothing. Don't worry about it.
Untie me.

646
00:52:18,202 --> 00:52:20,870
- What's that shit on you?
- Nothing. Untie me.

647
00:52:20,872 --> 00:52:23,405
Jeez, you jerk off
with your hands tied?

648
00:52:23,407 --> 00:52:24,940
Yeah, I jerked off
with my hands tied.

649
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:27,276
It's really fucking easy.
Come on. Untie me.

650
00:52:27,278 --> 00:52:29,445
- Where is she?
- I don't know where she is.

651
00:52:29,447 --> 00:52:31,514
I don't know.
Where the fuck have you been?

652
00:52:31,516 --> 00:52:34,884
- Oh!
- Helen!

653
00:52:34,886 --> 00:52:37,186
She's gone, man.

654
00:52:37,188 --> 00:52:39,455
You want to help
with my feet at least? Oh!

655
00:52:40,892 --> 00:52:43,425
- Helen!
- Einar.

656
00:52:43,427 --> 00:52:47,663
Dude. Wait up. Shit!

657
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:50,766
Dame it, dude.

658
00:52:51,569 --> 00:52:54,970
- I can't find her anywhere.
- Dude, I'm so sorry.

659
00:52:54,972 --> 00:52:58,174
We could... we could um,
we could call the police,

660
00:52:58,176 --> 00:53:01,911
- tell them everything we know.
- That's a genius. Just genius.

661
00:53:01,913 --> 00:53:04,413
You want to end up in a Moroccan
prison for the rest of your life?

662
00:53:04,415 --> 00:53:07,716
Shit, you're right. You're right.
You're right. Fuck, we're fucked.

663
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:10,986
That's exactly what we are,
fucked. It's all your fault!

664
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,822
- My fault?
- You got it.

665
00:53:13,824 --> 00:53:14,924
My fault?

666
00:53:14,926 --> 00:53:18,227
You're the one who knew
Helen was prone to possession.

667
00:53:18,229 --> 00:53:20,396
You're the one who knew
that she was possessed as a kid.

668
00:53:20,398 --> 00:53:23,933
You knew Casablanca
was gonna be a bad place for her

669
00:53:23,935 --> 00:53:26,268
but you know, you came.
It's your fucking fault.

670
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,938
- You kept the fucking secret.
- You're the one who let her go.

671
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:31,507
I told you, she knocked me out.
I was passed out.

672
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:35,277
I'm sure you love that shit.
You just love being knocked out.

673
00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:36,912
How do I love being knocked out?

674
00:53:36,914 --> 00:53:39,582
Figure it out.
Figure it out, Mr. Storyteller.

675
00:53:39,584 --> 00:53:41,784
You're so caught up
in your imaginary tales,

676
00:53:41,786 --> 00:53:44,620
you don't respect reality.
You don't know what reality is.

677
00:53:44,622 --> 00:53:46,422
- My story is not...
- Like you're in a fucking movie.

678
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:48,457
My stories are not imaginary.
They're real.

679
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:49,825
- Oh they're real?
- Yeah.

680
00:53:49,827 --> 00:53:51,427
Where can I see
one of your real,

681
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:52,595
real tales? Huh?

682
00:53:52,597 --> 00:53:54,296
On Netflix? Hulu?

683
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:55,965
No, not even on YouTube.

684
00:53:57,902 --> 00:53:58,968
You're a failure, man.

685
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:02,705
You know what your problem is?
You have one foot in the past,

686
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:05,608
one foot in the future
and you piss on the present.

687
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:08,711
Whatever you went through,
when you were a kid,

688
00:54:08,713 --> 00:54:10,846
you should have
just dealt with it.

689
00:54:10,848 --> 00:54:13,983
Because now you're spilling
that shit on me and Helen.

690
00:54:14,952 --> 00:54:16,785
That's what cowards do.

691
00:54:16,787 --> 00:54:20,322
That's exactly what you are.
You're a big fat coward.

692
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,393
Oh, that felt good.

693
00:54:24,395 --> 00:54:26,962
God, I am so glad you feel good,

694
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:32,067
'cause that feels good now.

695
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:33,535
That felt good.

696
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:34,770
I'm surprised.

697
00:54:44,882 --> 00:54:46,749
What the fuck...?

698
00:54:46,751 --> 00:54:48,751
- Shit!
- Who the fuck is that?

699
00:54:48,753 --> 00:54:51,420
That's... that's Mancherbruuk.

700
00:54:51,422 --> 00:54:53,856
- Is she dead?
- I don't know. I didn't touch her.

701
00:54:59,363 --> 00:55:01,997
The motor.

702
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:04,633
It stopped.

703
00:55:07,071 --> 00:55:08,337
And there's electricity.

704
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:22,418
- Shit, it's open.
- Yeah, I can see that.

705
00:55:23,354 --> 00:55:25,587
What do we do? What do we do?

706
00:55:31,962 --> 00:55:33,962
Mark? Mark?

707
00:55:38,736 --> 00:55:42,838
Einar...
What the fuck was that? Oh shit!

708
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,106
What the fuck is this?

709
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:47,042
- What the fuck is that?
- I don't know.

710
00:55:47,044 --> 00:55:50,579
Oh shit!
Mark, is that a fucking lamb?

711
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:52,648
- Is that a real human being?
- Oh shit.

712
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:55,951
- Yeah, yeah. Okay. We got to go.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

713
00:55:55,953 --> 00:55:57,820
- What do you mean no?
- No, we've gone too far.

714
00:55:57,822 --> 00:55:59,488
Fucking shut up!

715
00:56:01,092 --> 00:56:02,891
Okay. Okay.

716
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:07,596
Oh. What is...
what is this? Oh my God.

717
00:56:09,767 --> 00:56:12,134
What are you doing?
Why are you touching it?

718
00:56:12,136 --> 00:56:14,937
- Why are you touching it?
- What the fuck is that?

719
00:56:14,939 --> 00:56:17,139
Oh, God, no!

720
00:56:17,141 --> 00:56:18,807
Oh, shit!

721
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:21,777
There's got to be
something, a way out.

722
00:56:21,779 --> 00:56:22,899
Where are you going?

723
00:56:25,649 --> 00:56:27,850
Wait. The motor is meant
to cover their screams.

724
00:56:27,852 --> 00:56:30,152
Shit, you think so?

725
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:34,957
- I see lights.
- Where are they coming from?

726
00:56:34,959 --> 00:56:37,159
I don't know. I've never
been here before. Shut up!

727
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,830
Okay. What's that smell?

728
00:56:41,832 --> 00:56:44,867
That's smell?
I don't know. It smells bad.

729
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:47,836
- A bit like Sulfur.
- I don't know.

730
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:49,605
- Okay, okay.
- What are you doing?

731
00:56:49,607 --> 00:56:51,940
- I don't know...
- Don't go in there.

732
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:54,777
- Sh...
- You stupid prick.

733
00:56:54,779 --> 00:56:58,213
- I hate you. I fucking hate you.
- What the fuck is...

734
00:57:00,885 --> 00:57:02,851
Oh! It's a bunch
of kid shit.

735
00:57:02,853 --> 00:57:05,454
It's a bunch of kid shit.

736
00:57:05,456 --> 00:57:07,689
- And um, it's posters.
- This is Daniel's room.

737
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:11,760
- This is Daniel's room.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe.

738
00:57:14,532 --> 00:57:17,032
Tareek. Mrs. Frangier.

739
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:18,767
What's going on?

740
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,536
Oh fuck, it's locked.

741
00:57:20,538 --> 00:57:23,672
Not even try.

742
00:57:24,575 --> 00:57:25,974
Tareek, put the gun down.

743
00:57:31,215 --> 00:57:35,684
- Yes, he was 11 years when it happened.
- What? Who?

744
00:57:35,686 --> 00:57:37,886
- We tried everything.
- Daniel?

745
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:41,123
Every possible exorcism
you can imagine.

746
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:44,760
Until I came to understand
that the demon inside of my son

747
00:57:44,762 --> 00:57:47,796
- is what keeps him alive.
- Oh shit!

748
00:57:50,768 --> 00:57:54,903
- Is that Daniel?
- If the demon dies, my son dies.

749
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:55,905
Tareek?

750
00:57:59,243 --> 00:58:00,609
Daniel?

751
00:58:00,611 --> 00:58:01,777
Son of a bitch!

752
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:02,911
- What?
- Stay back.

753
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:04,746
Please. Go! Get back!

754
00:58:04,748 --> 00:58:07,282
The only way to keep
my son alive

755
00:58:07,284 --> 00:58:12,254
is to feed the demon a soul,
every six years.

756
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:16,158
Not any soul.

757
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:20,629
A soul tortured enough,
a soul dark enough,

758
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:26,268
so he can feed off of it
and live for another six years.

759
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:30,172
A soul like
the one of your friend, Helen.

760
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:31,673
What? You fucking...

761
00:58:33,744 --> 00:58:37,946
Twenty years with a demon,
you learn a few tricks.

762
00:58:37,948 --> 00:58:42,017
Tareek, take care
of our guest as usual.

763
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:43,685
Yes, master.

764
00:58:44,722 --> 00:58:46,889
Tareek,
you don't have to do this.

765
00:58:46,891 --> 00:58:48,957
Tareek, please.
You don't have to do this.

766
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:52,094
Please, Mark.
Don't resist. Just walk.

767
00:58:52,096 --> 00:58:54,830
Tareek, you don't have to do
this. Please don't do this.

768
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:57,099
You can't just leave him here.
We gotta get him a doctor.

769
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:58,934
You can't just leave him
here, please.

770
00:58:58,936 --> 00:59:01,637
Okay. Einar,
I'm coming back for you.

771
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:02,938
I'm coming back for you, buddy.

772
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,575
I'm coming back, buddy.

773
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:27,863
Tareek, please tell me.
How do I look?

774
00:59:27,865 --> 00:59:29,631
You look perfect, master.

775
00:59:29,633 --> 00:59:33,001
Not the Hollywood reaction,
please.

776
00:59:33,003 --> 00:59:34,770
I want the truth.

777
00:59:36,307 --> 00:59:38,974
I think there's a little
too much lipstick.

778
00:59:39,944 --> 00:59:44,880
Extravagance is a privilege only
very few can carry with elegance.

779
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:47,583
Tell me I'm elegant.

780
00:59:48,852 --> 00:59:50,852
You are very elegant, master.

781
00:59:50,854 --> 00:59:53,188
The very is not necessary,

782
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:56,658
but do you have always
to embellish things?

783
00:59:57,828 --> 00:59:59,094
I am sorry, master.

784
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:00,862
And don't say, "I'm sorry."

785
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:05,867
It drains the little bit
of dignity you have left.

786
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:07,603
Sorry.

787
01:00:07,605 --> 01:00:09,871
Help!

788
01:00:09,873 --> 01:00:11,006
What is this?

789
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:14,176
It's the boys, Master.

790
01:00:14,178 --> 01:00:15,877
Didn't you bury them yet?

791
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:18,747
Not yet, Master.

792
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:20,917
Why?

793
01:00:23,621 --> 01:00:26,054
I know you want me to continue
filming, Master,

794
01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:29,124
but it's been their story
from the beginning.

795
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:31,093
Their point of view

796
01:00:31,095 --> 01:00:33,929
and if suddenly
the point of view shifts,

797
01:00:33,931 --> 01:00:36,999
it will be in steep rupture
with basic film drama.

798
01:00:37,001 --> 01:00:39,401
So I'm just suggesting

799
01:00:39,403 --> 01:00:41,436
not to kill them
till they finish their film.

800
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,942
Since when, are you passionate
about cinema?

801
01:00:46,944 --> 01:00:50,212
I've always been very passionate
about cinema, Master.

802
01:00:50,214 --> 01:00:52,214
I just never mentioned it.

803
01:00:53,017 --> 01:00:56,251
You are not to be passionate
about anything.

804
01:00:57,354 --> 01:01:01,023
The only thing you are to be
passionate about is me.

805
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:05,293
Do you understand that?

806
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:07,663
Yes, Master.

807
01:01:08,866 --> 01:01:11,366
And you will bury them tonight.

808
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:13,301
Yes, Master.

809
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:21,243
Help!

810
01:01:22,479 --> 01:01:24,312
Help!

811
01:01:24,314 --> 01:01:26,481
Help!

812
01:01:26,483 --> 01:01:28,417
Somebody, please help!

813
01:01:28,419 --> 01:01:32,354
Help! Help!

814
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:35,791
Mark, how many times
do I have to tell you

815
01:01:35,793 --> 01:01:37,993
you're shouting through
a cemented window?

816
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:43,298
They were waiting for us,
in Daniel's room.

817
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:47,002
They even shut off the motor
to lure us in.

818
01:01:47,004 --> 01:01:49,705
We fell right
into their trap. Get it?

819
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:53,942
- Don't talk like that...
- They've thought of everything.

820
01:01:53,944 --> 01:01:55,143
It's over.

821
01:01:56,346 --> 01:01:57,346
It's over.

822
01:01:58,882 --> 01:01:59,882
It's okay.

823
01:02:01,952 --> 01:02:03,051
We had a good run.

824
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:09,825
I guess, I'll never
get to make my movie.

825
01:02:09,827 --> 01:02:16,531
You really think your little stupid found-footage
horror film would have changed something?

826
01:02:16,533 --> 01:02:18,366
Huh? Changed the world?

827
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:22,771
Do you know how you Marks
there are out there, right now,

828
01:02:22,773 --> 01:02:25,874
trying to do exactly the same
thing you were trying to do?

829
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:30,312
How's your film any more special
than theirs?

830
01:02:30,314 --> 01:02:32,781
Everyone dies
in a found-footage movie.

831
01:02:32,783 --> 01:02:34,182
I would have lived.

832
01:02:34,184 --> 01:02:36,551
Oh! Wouldn't that be a twist?

833
01:02:37,354 --> 01:02:39,955
And how would that work exactly?
Can you share?

834
01:02:39,957 --> 01:02:42,057
Because maybe we can
get the fuck out of here.

835
01:02:45,529 --> 01:02:47,996
You know, these are
our last moments together,

836
01:02:47,998 --> 01:02:50,298
a little character
transformation wouldn't hurt.

837
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:58,256
Fuck you!

838
01:02:58,257 --> 01:02:59,817
How's that for character
transformation?

839
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:01,444
Perfect.

840
01:03:08,352 --> 01:03:09,451
I'm sorry, guys.

841
01:03:10,854 --> 01:03:11,953
It's time to go.

842
01:03:18,562 --> 01:03:21,163
Hurry up please,
they don't have much time.

843
01:03:22,032 --> 01:03:23,165
What's the rush?

844
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:24,599
The transfer of the soul

845
01:03:24,601 --> 01:03:26,434
needs to be done
before midnight.

846
01:03:26,436 --> 01:03:27,869
Helen's gone.

847
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:29,538
You're not gonna
get her.

848
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:33,008
She will be found trust me.

849
01:03:34,578 --> 01:03:37,913
By who? The government?

850
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:46,288
Booyah is real, isn't it?

851
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:53,128
Tareek... is Booyah real?

852
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:57,899
Booyah is just
an old legend, Einar.

853
01:03:58,569 --> 01:04:01,870
That tale grandmothers
tell their children

854
01:04:01,872 --> 01:04:04,339
so that they don't go out
playing in the street at night.

855
01:04:05,142 --> 01:04:06,142
You're lying.

856
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:09,512
You're lying.

857
01:04:13,116 --> 01:04:14,216
I need to take a piss.

858
01:04:15,219 --> 01:04:17,352
Can I take a piss before I die?

859
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:18,486
Can you please give me that?

860
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:20,956
Sure.

861
01:04:28,432 --> 01:04:30,265
You're not holding it right.

862
01:04:30,267 --> 01:04:32,634
The camera... your...

863
01:04:32,636 --> 01:04:36,004
it's just there's better...
there's better ways to hold it.

864
01:04:36,006 --> 01:04:39,608
So, you can hold like this
and you can pan it around.

865
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:45,380
It's as simple as that. And we
can get the screen like this.

866
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:49,317
That way you can view it without
actually having to lose your shot.

867
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:51,353
You can also hold it like this.

868
01:04:51,355 --> 01:04:53,588
Are you in low light mode?

869
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:58,960
- Low light mode?
- Um you get better dynamic range in low light mode.

870
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:01,162
A better latitude.

871
01:05:02,332 --> 01:05:05,967
- Latitude?
- Latitude, yeah.

872
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:12,140
- Put it down.
- Do it.

873
01:05:12,142 --> 01:05:14,142
Einar, just do it.

874
01:05:14,144 --> 01:05:15,911
He can't shoot both of us,
trust me.

875
01:05:15,913 --> 01:05:17,612
- Shut up, Mark.
- Please...

876
01:05:17,614 --> 01:05:19,214
calm down, Einar.

877
01:05:19,216 --> 01:05:21,650
Please just take him out.

878
01:05:21,652 --> 01:05:23,585
Just take him out.

879
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:24,986
Come on! Do it.

880
01:05:24,988 --> 01:05:25,988
Do you want me to...

881
01:05:30,627 --> 01:05:32,227
What the fuck?

882
01:05:33,931 --> 01:05:35,730
It's okay.

883
01:05:35,732 --> 01:05:37,198
I'm sorry.

884
01:05:38,135 --> 01:05:39,301
Fuck!

885
01:05:48,312 --> 01:05:50,679
You've been very silent, Tareek.

886
01:05:52,015 --> 01:05:53,015
Are you sad?

887
01:05:54,418 --> 01:05:56,551
Yes, Master. A little bit.

888
01:05:57,387 --> 01:05:58,387
You shouldn't be.

889
01:06:00,057 --> 01:06:02,123
You saved one life.

890
01:06:03,193 --> 01:06:07,696
You give him a rubber hose
so he could breathe

891
01:06:07,698 --> 01:06:09,130
and a torchlight,

892
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:13,468
so he could light
during the night.

893
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,103
But tell me,

894
01:06:16,707 --> 01:06:17,772
which one was it?

895
01:06:21,044 --> 01:06:23,111
The cute one or the other one?

896
01:06:25,182 --> 01:06:26,614
The other one or the cute one?

897
01:06:27,784 --> 01:06:29,384
Come on.

898
01:06:30,721 --> 01:06:31,721
Tell me.

899
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:57,412
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

900
01:06:57,414 --> 01:07:03,485
Uh! Mark. Uh, Mark!

901
01:07:10,093 --> 01:07:12,360
You're shaking

902
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:14,696
as if I was going
to reprimand you.

903
01:07:15,766 --> 01:07:18,099
Sorry, Master. I'm very sorry.

904
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:21,269
I respect your feelings, Tareek.

905
01:07:23,673 --> 01:07:26,708
Look, it's a full moon tonight.

906
01:07:29,046 --> 01:07:30,745
I like full moons.

907
01:07:32,449 --> 01:07:35,050
They're filled
with so much meaning,

908
01:07:35,052 --> 01:07:37,552
all these legends
about full moons,

909
01:07:38,688 --> 01:07:41,389
all these creepy tales
of darkness.

910
01:07:42,292 --> 01:07:45,493
There is this legend
about an old woman

911
01:07:45,495 --> 01:07:47,529
who kills people with an ax.

912
01:07:47,531 --> 01:07:49,664
Have you ever heard of it?

913
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:54,402
It is called

914
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:01,843
The legend of the woman
with big grey eyes.

915
01:08:01,845 --> 01:08:05,747
So this woman,
she's driving in her car alone,

916
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:09,617
her eyes fixed on the road.

917
01:08:09,619 --> 01:08:13,121
The moon is staring at her
but she never looks at the moon.

918
01:08:13,723 --> 01:08:16,458
So the moon becomes dense

919
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:18,393
and begins to darken.

920
01:08:18,395 --> 01:08:22,430
Her blue tones slowly fade

921
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:26,501
and a greyish veil
begins to envelope her.

922
01:08:26,503 --> 01:08:28,703
The old woman feels so sick

923
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:35,110
like a strange tingling
sensation on her neck.

924
01:08:35,112 --> 01:08:37,812
She looks up, and there...

925
01:08:37,814 --> 01:08:39,581
suddenly...

926
01:08:45,722 --> 01:08:49,724
The moon's eyes close

927
01:08:49,726 --> 01:08:53,394
and her blue dress
slowly envelopes her.

928
01:08:53,396 --> 01:08:57,499
And she disappears
into the darkness.

929
01:09:20,524 --> 01:09:23,191
Fuck!

930
01:09:24,761 --> 01:09:25,827
Mark?

931
01:09:30,267 --> 01:09:31,533
Mark!

932
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,339
Mark!

933
01:09:40,977 --> 01:09:42,710
Are you down there!

934
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:49,450
Fuck! Fuck!

935
01:09:52,622 --> 01:09:55,190
Mark! Come on,
talk to me, buddy.

936
01:10:28,925 --> 01:10:30,792
Mark. Mark.

937
01:10:34,764 --> 01:10:36,231
Fuck.

938
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:41,936
Come on.

939
01:10:50,447 --> 01:10:53,448
Mark?

940
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:56,951
Mark?

941
01:11:01,558 --> 01:11:02,558
Come on, buddy.

942
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:15,570
No! No!

943
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:14,329
How are you, sweetie?

944
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:15,830
Stay quiet.

945
01:12:17,467 --> 01:12:20,601
If you stay quiet,
everything will be just fine.

946
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,604
Do you understand?

947
01:12:49,099 --> 01:12:51,065
Oh, fuck.

948
01:12:51,067 --> 01:12:52,767
You got to stay calm.

949
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:14,989
Helen!

950
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,526
Helen!

951
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:35,877
Excuse me. Booyah?
Do you know where Booyah is?

952
01:13:35,879 --> 01:13:37,578
Booyah!

953
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:39,680
- Do you know where Booyah is?
- What?

954
01:13:49,559 --> 01:13:53,428
Excuse me, Booyah?
Do you know where Booyah is?

955
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:55,897
Booyah?
Do you know where Booyah is?

956
01:14:40,276 --> 01:14:41,943
Help. Help me.

957
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:50,585
Help! Help! Help. I need help.

958
01:14:50,587 --> 01:14:52,119
Do you know where Booyah is?
Can you take me?

959
01:14:52,121 --> 01:14:54,522
Can you take me to Bo... Fuck!

960
01:14:55,492 --> 01:14:56,791
Fuck!

961
01:15:03,066 --> 01:15:04,599
Please, stop. Stop!

962
01:15:11,274 --> 01:15:12,874
Can you take me to Booyah?

963
01:15:12,876 --> 01:15:14,675
Sir?

964
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:15,743
You can?

965
01:15:15,745 --> 01:15:18,679
Sir, please.

966
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:20,014
Yes? You can?

967
01:15:23,586 --> 01:15:24,986
Are you an angel?

968
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:36,190
Lord of darkness.

969
01:16:36,192 --> 01:16:38,759
You are the king of universe.

970
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:41,362
It is filled with your darkness

971
01:16:41,364 --> 01:16:44,031
and your darkness alone.

972
01:16:44,033 --> 01:16:47,335
Command this soul into my son

973
01:16:47,337 --> 01:16:52,707
for you have done
him into your kingdom.

974
01:17:07,924 --> 01:17:08,924
This is Booyah?

975
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:11,792
The old slaughterhouse?

976
01:18:07,383 --> 01:18:09,250
Oh, God!

977
01:18:21,064 --> 01:18:22,129
Oh, God.

978
01:18:26,903 --> 01:18:28,402
I just want my friend, Helen.

979
01:18:33,276 --> 01:18:36,277
Helen, I know you're in here.

980
01:18:37,146 --> 01:18:40,748
I'm so sorry.

981
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:45,720
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry
for everything that happened.

982
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:50,157
Please, Helen.

983
01:18:52,495 --> 01:18:54,762
You just have to come out.

984
01:18:59,302 --> 01:19:00,367
Oh.

985
01:19:03,206 --> 01:19:05,039
Oh.

986
01:19:08,945 --> 01:19:13,247
Just come out, Helen,
and we can go home.

987
01:19:20,389 --> 01:19:24,391
Helen,
you just have to come out, okay.

988
01:19:30,767 --> 01:19:32,299
Let's go home.

989
01:20:58,387 --> 01:21:00,487
Helen!

990
01:21:02,391 --> 01:21:03,524
Helen!

991
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:05,626
Helen!

992
01:21:07,563 --> 01:21:09,563
Helen!

993
01:21:09,565 --> 01:21:11,065
Helen!

994
01:21:11,067 --> 01:21:13,300
Helen!

995
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:17,439
Helen!

996
01:21:18,407 --> 01:21:20,140
Helen, wait!

997
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:07,655
I'm so sorry.

998
01:22:12,161 --> 01:22:13,327
I'm so sorry.

999
01:22:27,076 --> 01:22:29,209
We gotta go. We gotta go.

1000
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:18,493
Who are you?

1001
01:24:02,338 --> 01:24:04,204
Sit down. Sit.

1002
01:24:20,489 --> 01:24:21,489
Fuck.

1003
01:24:23,426 --> 01:24:24,458
Fuck!

1004
01:24:39,442 --> 01:24:43,110
Helen... listen.

1005
01:24:43,846 --> 01:24:45,512
I need to go back.

1006
01:24:46,749 --> 01:24:48,382
I need to go get Mark's camera.

1007
01:24:52,088 --> 01:24:54,088
You stay here. Okay?

1008
01:24:55,324 --> 01:24:57,758
If I'm not back
in fifteen minutes,

1009
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,394
go find the American Embassy.

1010
01:25:00,396 --> 01:25:02,529
Tell them everything
that happened here.

1011
01:25:04,467 --> 01:25:06,366
They won't believe you,

1012
01:25:06,368 --> 01:25:09,503
but at least
you'll be safe. Okay?

1013
01:25:13,909 --> 01:25:15,742
Hey, hey!

1014
01:25:17,546 --> 01:25:18,546
Look at me.

1015
01:25:21,117 --> 01:25:22,883
You'll get so many views.

1016
01:25:24,353 --> 01:25:26,687
Millions, millions of viewers.

1017
01:25:28,324 --> 01:25:30,657
More reviews
that you could ever dream of.

1018
01:25:32,261 --> 01:25:33,261
Okay?

1019
01:25:38,767 --> 01:25:39,767
I love you.

1020
01:26:57,646 --> 01:27:00,581
Okay. Okay.

1021
01:27:08,857 --> 01:27:10,591
- Momma.
- What?

1022
01:27:13,629 --> 01:27:16,496
Momma. Momma.

1023
01:27:16,498 --> 01:27:18,632
Momma.

1024
01:27:18,634 --> 01:27:21,468
Your mom is dead, Daniel.

1025
01:27:29,912 --> 01:27:32,246
Momma!

1026
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:36,016
Momma!

1027
01:29:06,475 --> 01:29:07,708
This one's for you, Mark!
