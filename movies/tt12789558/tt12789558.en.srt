Kids, please, go inside.

162
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:50,423
I don't want you out here
until it's all safe again.

163
00:08:50,456 --> 00:08:52,291
- Come on.
- MAN: Come on, load them up here.

164
00:08:52,325 --> 00:08:53,526
WOMAN: Would you look at the
poor children with that load.

165
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,261
MAN: Can you wheel that
up to the front?

166
00:08:55,294 --> 00:08:56,696
Frankie will show you
where we're putting it.

167

MAN: Tell Paddy I'll be there
in a minute to fix that.

168
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:00,266
I've just got to nip into
the house and get my tools.

169
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:00,933

getting up there, love.

from them sharp edges.

173

MAN:
Pull them rocks up.

174
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:11,644
MAN: Everything.
Put that washing machine in.

I've literally just come
from the airport.

198
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:07,934
I live in that street.
That's my kids there.

SOLDIER: Where do you think
you're going, love?

204
00:10:20,446 --> 00:10:21,614
To bring my husband home.

205
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:22,882
That's him
on the other side there.

206
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:24,050
SOLDIER:
Where's he been, then?

207
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,518
MA:
None of your bloody business.

208
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:27,353
Not with you
in your hour of need?

209
00:10:27,386 --> 00:10:28,621
- That's a bit off, isn't it?
- He works away in England.

210
00:10:28,654 --> 00:10:30,490
Does he?
What kind of work is that?

211
00:10:30,523 --> 00:10:32,058
- He's a joiner.
- I see.

212
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:33,893
And has he joined
any of these groups

213
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:35,495
making all this mess
in your street?

214
00:10:35,528 --> 00:10:36,896
He knew nothing about
the whole bloody thing.

215
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:38,498
That's why he's here now.

216
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:40,333
He's come home from
his work to see his family.

217
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:42,401
Glad to hear it, madam.

in a second, Frankie.

Stay in your homes tonight.

- Okay?

227
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:02,321
Aye.

- the Starship Enterprise...
- GRANNY: Did they attack you?

232
00:11:12,598 --> 00:11:15,434
No. It was only
the Catholic houses.

233
00:11:15,468 --> 00:11:17,770
Them boyos want them out.

234
00:11:17,804 --> 00:11:20,006
Them peoples don't give you
any bother in that street,

235
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,641
- do they?
- Not at all.

236
00:11:21,674 --> 00:11:24,443
Sure, they're friends,
they're family, same as us.

237
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:26,045
They just kick
with the left foot.

238
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:27,680
Exactly.

239
00:11:27,713 --> 00:11:30,016
Sure, my best friend in
the street is Mrs. Ganjawala.

240
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:31,484
She's Indian.

241
00:11:31,517 --> 00:11:33,419
She even comes to
the wee mission with me.

242
00:11:33,452 --> 00:11:35,822
Well, them curries,
I tried one once.

keeps you going, isn't it?

00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:49,368
Sure, I'm not gonna be
running up the Cave Hill

any time soon, am I? (coughs)

- GRANNY: That's not easy.

affect their schooling.

252
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:56,976
Will, would you
turn that telly off

253
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,011
- and talk to your granny?
- Hi, Pop.

Hiya, Buddy.

want to see you again?

00:12:05,152 --> 00:12:07,553
He's given me a letter
for the hospital.

- There's no point.

258

(sighs)

259
00:12:12,658 --> 00:12:16,762
I think you've a few
big decisions to make, son.

260
00:12:19,498 --> 00:12:21,467
Did you clear up
that wee bit of trouble

261
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,536
- we were talking about?
- GRANNY: Hey, wee fellas.

Oh, yes, we've friends
on the Protestant side.

265

They weren't friends last night.

266
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,021
They weren't
friends last night, though.

BUDDY: Paddy Kavanagh told me
as long as Catholics

268
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,760
keep confessing everything bad
that they do to a priest,

269
00:12:47,793 --> 00:12:49,495
then they can do
whatever they want

270
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:51,030
and God will forgive them
all the time.

271
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:52,899
Well, Paddy Kavanagh's
family's not gonna be living

272
00:12:52,932 --> 00:12:54,667
in this street for much longer,
so you'd better check

273
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,602
he's not taking
the hand out of you.

274
00:12:56,636 --> 00:12:58,171
Ugh, I don't know how it works.

275
00:12:58,205 --> 00:13:00,506
They get a lot of water thrown
on them and then they're okay.

276
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:01,774
I think that's it.

277
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:03,509
- Why aren't you going, too?
- (chuckles)

'Cause me and your father
have business to discuss.

Come on. (kisses)

281
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:10,816
- What are those?
- (chuckles) My little secret.

282
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,685
Now, come on.

283
00:13:13,753 --> 00:13:16,522
I've had too much God
for one day.

284
00:13:16,555 --> 00:13:19,458
Well, your granny says you can
never have too much God.

285
00:13:19,492 --> 00:13:20,693
You might need him
before too long.

286
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:22,528
Look, mind your nonsense
for now,

287
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:24,030
and I'll take youse all
to the pictures tomorrow.

288
00:13:24,063 --> 00:13:25,798
Brilliant!

289

<i>Robin and the 7 Hoods</i> is on

at the Capitol.

291
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:30,836
- Paddy saw it.
- MA: Wait, is that gangsters?

292
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,539
- WILL: It's a blinking musical.
- No, it's not.

293
00:13:33,572 --> 00:13:35,875
There's Little John
and swords and everything.

294

MA: Well, you can't go
tomorrow afternoon.

295

Your cousins will be here.

But, Daddy,
are you not gonna be

299
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,750
a vigilante on our barricade?

300
00:13:44,784 --> 00:13:46,919
PA: (sighs) No more talk
about bloody barricades.

301

too sure about that.

303
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:54,627
PA: Hey, less of
the long face, son.

304
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,696
These two can go
and pray for it to stop now,

305

picture house in town tomorrow,

back to work.

309
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:05,571
Was that our side
that done all that

310
00:14:05,604 --> 00:14:08,708
to them Catholic houses
in our street, Daddy?

311
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:11,844
There is no our side
and their side in our street.

312
00:14:11,877 --> 00:14:14,714
Or there didn't
used to be, anyway.

313
00:14:14,747 --> 00:14:16,916

But, Daddy,
if we were Catholics,

we could not go to church,

318

and then every once
in a wee while,

319
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:28,828
we could go in and confess,

320
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:30,863

we were forgiven

00:21:35,355 --> 00:21:36,423
See you, now.

472
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:41,161
All the big boys have left.

473
00:21:41,194 --> 00:21:42,562
Buddy, give your brother
a hand there, will you?

474
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:43,996
Pick this sofa up, right?

475
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:45,632
MA:
Here, can you give us a hand?

476
00:21:45,665 --> 00:21:47,700
SOLDIER:
Yes, ma'am.

477
00:21:47,734 --> 00:21:49,202
MA:
You want to set your gun down?

478
00:21:49,235 --> 00:21:51,204
SOLDIER:
No, it's all right, thank you.

479
00:21:52,138 --> 00:21:54,340
MA: Now, don't you be
scratching my walls with that.

480
00:21:54,374 --> 00:21:56,041
PA:
You got it? Right now, hold on.

481
00:21:56,074 --> 00:21:58,043
This worked earlier.

482
00:21:58,076 --> 00:22:00,146
I'll go in first.

483
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,216
- All right?
- Stewart.

484
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:05,318
- MR. STEWART: Frankie.
- FRANKIE: All right?

485
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:06,286
All right, Frankie?

486
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:08,254
Is that you all this time
at the barricades?

487
00:22:08,288 --> 00:22:09,589
Somebody has to.

488
00:22:09,622 --> 00:22:11,224
Better me than Billy Clanton.

489
00:22:11,257 --> 00:22:12,659
Aye.

490
00:22:12,692 --> 00:22:14,761
Not many people chose this.

491
00:22:14,794 --> 00:22:16,563
There's a few men hiding
behind them barricades.

492
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:18,030
And they'll keep hiding

493
00:22:18,063 --> 00:22:19,064
where they're afraid
for their families.

494
00:22:19,097 --> 00:22:21,066
It's a waiting game now.

495
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:22,435
When it's time
for that wall to come down,

496
00:22:22,469 --> 00:22:25,138
I'll be the first
to swing a hammer, but now?

497
00:22:25,171 --> 00:22:28,208
"They also serve
who stand and wait."

498
00:22:30,176 --> 00:22:32,946
We can't all be acting
the Lone Ranger.

499
00:22:42,054 --> 00:22:44,290
(explosive booming)

500
00:22:45,258 --> 00:22:48,060
MAN (over speakers): This is
a story of long, long ago,

501
00:22:48,093 --> 00:22:50,663
when the world
was just beginning.

502
00:22:50,697 --> 00:22:52,298
A young world.

503
00:22:52,332 --> 00:22:54,801
A world early
in the morning of time.

504
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:57,102
(dinosaurs roaring)

505
00:23:00,607 --> 00:23:03,276
(rocks clattering)

506
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:08,648
(Ma scoffs softly)

507
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:11,551
No wonder
you brought us to this.

508
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:14,187
It's educational for the boys.

509
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,421
Aye.

510
00:23:17,624 --> 00:23:20,393
MA: Raquel Welch is
a hell of an education.

511
00:23:20,426 --> 00:23:21,461
(slurping)

512
00:23:21,494 --> 00:23:23,563
(thunder rumbling softly)

513
00:23:24,697 --> 00:23:27,133
(distant sirens wailing)

514
00:23:29,202 --> 00:23:31,604
PA: If people ask you to join
anything, deliver anything,

515
00:23:31,638 --> 00:23:34,574
do messages for anybody,
you do nothing, okay?

516
00:23:34,607 --> 00:23:37,143
You tell your ma, she'll
tell me, and I'll sort it.

517
00:23:37,176 --> 00:23:38,711
- You understand me?
- WILL: Yes, Daddy.

518
00:23:38,745 --> 00:23:41,214
Very good.
I'm proud of you, son.

519
00:23:41,247 --> 00:23:42,549
Now get off to bed,
the pair of you.

520
00:23:42,582 --> 00:23:44,417
I'm up too early
in the morning to see you,

521
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,653
so make sure you get to school
all right, all right?

522
00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:48,821
Don't mess your mother about,
and I'll see you in two weeks.

523
00:23:48,855 --> 00:23:50,623
- Okay?
- Yes, Daddy.

524
00:23:50,657 --> 00:23:52,057
Good boys.

525
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:55,562
MINISTER:
<i>A fork in the road.</i>

526
00:23:55,595 --> 00:24:00,633
<i>In one direction,
a straight and narrow highway.</i>

527
00:24:02,335 --> 00:24:05,103
<i>Which road will you take?!</i>

528
00:24:05,138 --> 00:24:07,340
(toilet flushes)

529
00:24:08,775 --> 00:24:10,310
MA:
You're running round here

530
00:24:10,343 --> 00:24:11,811
like the man
in the big picture,

531
00:24:11,844 --> 00:24:13,246
not paying your taxes

532
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,581
and spending all our money
on horses.

533
00:24:14,614 --> 00:24:16,149
It's the building trade.

534
00:24:16,182 --> 00:24:17,784
I told you it doesn't work
the normal way.

535
00:24:17,817 --> 00:24:19,185
I told you I had it covered.

536
00:24:19,218 --> 00:24:20,520
I was the one
who had it covered.

537
00:24:20,553 --> 00:24:22,188
No, you had us paying
three years of back tax.

538
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:23,723
To keep you out of bloody jail.

539
00:24:23,756 --> 00:24:25,892
We're drowning in debt.

540
00:24:25,925 --> 00:24:27,894
PA: We're near done
with the back tax.

541
00:24:27,927 --> 00:24:30,196
Ten pound a month
for three bloody years.

542
00:24:30,229 --> 00:24:32,432
This is the time to think
about making a new start.

543
00:24:32,465 --> 00:24:35,401
I know nothing else
but Belfast.

544
00:24:35,435 --> 00:24:36,736
Exactly.

545
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:38,705
There's a whole world out there.

546
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:41,207
We can give these boys a
better chance than we ever had.

547
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,310
There's Commonwealth countries
needing tradesmen.

548
00:24:44,344 --> 00:24:46,546
The government will give you
assisted passage.

549
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:48,848
We can get the whole family
to the other side of the world

550
00:24:48,881 --> 00:24:50,717
for ten pound.

551
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,485
We're living in a civil war,

552
00:24:52,518 --> 00:24:56,121
and I'm not here
to protect my family.

553
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,660
MA:
What are those supposed to be?

554
00:25:00,693 --> 00:25:03,129
PA:
An escape route.

555
00:25:03,963 --> 00:25:06,366
(seagulls squawking)

556
00:25:09,569 --> 00:25:11,838
SOLDIER:
Get this street locked down.

557
00:25:11,871 --> 00:25:14,440
GIRL: Come on, get a move on.
We're gonna be late again.

558
00:25:14,474 --> 00:25:15,908
- Come on!
- (church bell tolling)

559
00:25:15,942 --> 00:25:17,510
NEWSMAN (over TV):
<i>Throughout the night,</i>

560
00:25:17,543 --> 00:25:19,779
<i>sniping became
the tactic of the rioters.</i>

561
00:25:19,812 --> 00:25:21,414
<i>As we drove past a side street,</i>

562
00:25:21,447 --> 00:25:23,816
<i>three men on the corner
dived for cover.</i>

563
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,652
- It's not bad, though, is it?
- <i>A young man with a revolver</i>

564
00:25:25,685 --> 00:25:27,253
<i>asked us for a lift.</i>

565
00:25:27,286 --> 00:25:29,389
<i>At 4:00 this morning,
RUC turned us back</i>

566
00:25:29,422 --> 00:25:31,391
- <i>from the Falls area.</i>
- Yeah.

567
00:25:31,424 --> 00:25:33,459
NEWSMAN: <i>Snipers, they said,
were still at work,</i>

568
00:25:33,493 --> 00:25:35,762
<i>and in the distance,
one heard the ominous burst</i>

569
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:37,330
<i>of machine-gun fire.</i>

570
00:25:37,363 --> 00:25:39,332
<i>The scene terrified me,</i>

571
00:25:39,365 --> 00:25:41,668
<i>but it reminded an
American colleague of Harlem,</i>

572
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:43,803
<i>but, he added, it seems easier
to get guns here.</i>

573
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:45,605
MA:
One more left.

574
00:25:45,638 --> 00:25:48,207
NEWSMAN: <i>Dawn over Belfast
today showed a grim scene,</i>

575
00:25:48,241 --> 00:25:49,976
<i>buildings scarred by fire,</i>

576
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:52,278
<i>thousands of pounds' worth
of damage caused,</i>

577
00:25:52,311 --> 00:25:53,946
<i>and, of course,
the tragic loss of life.</i>

578
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,450
<i>It's been a night of shame for
Belfast, one that will live on</i>

579
00:25:57,483 --> 00:25:58,851
<i>in the memories
of its people...</i>

580
00:25:58,885 --> 00:26:00,586
MA:
Come on, you two. School.

581
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,221
(birds chirping)

582
00:26:02,255 --> 00:26:04,457
(bell ringing)

583
00:26:05,992 --> 00:26:07,593
MISS LEWIS:
Walking, please. No running.

584
00:26:07,627 --> 00:26:10,229
- (laughter)
- BOY: Morning, miss.

585
00:26:10,263 --> 00:26:13,266
STUDENTS:
<i>Twelve elevens are 132.</i>

586
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:16,836
Twelve twelves are 144.

587
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:18,938
MISS LEWIS: Well, I'm pleased
to say your times tables

588
00:26:18,971 --> 00:26:20,473
were a lot more impressive
to hear

589
00:26:20,506 --> 00:26:21,974
than your test scores
were to read.

590
00:26:22,008 --> 00:26:23,342
The whole point
of these weekly tests

591
00:26:23,376 --> 00:26:24,911
is to monitor your progress.

592
00:26:24,944 --> 00:26:28,614
The best will sit directly by
my desk, the seat of learning,

593
00:26:28,648 --> 00:26:30,783
and the rest of you will view
your Sisyphean struggles

594
00:26:30,817 --> 00:26:33,286
from the distance
you have imposed upon yourself

595
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:34,353
by a lack of application.

596
00:26:34,387 --> 00:26:36,923
Billy Clanton Junior, 17%.

597
00:26:36,956 --> 00:26:38,858
Bottom row, seat 12.

598
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:40,827
Rachel, seat 11.

599
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,295
Martin to seat ten.

600
00:26:42,328 --> 00:26:43,596
Freddie, seat eight.

601
00:26:43,629 --> 00:26:45,398
Karen to seat four.

602
00:26:45,431 --> 00:26:49,869
And in the medal positions
this week, with 72%, in bronze,

603
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:52,305
is Buddy, seat three.

604
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:55,541
And, of course, in silver
again, we have Ron,

605
00:26:55,575 --> 00:26:58,444
and Catherine with
the gold yet again this week.

606
00:26:58,478 --> 00:27:00,847
Congratulations, Catherine.
Very well done.

607
00:27:06,586 --> 00:27:10,356
The wee girl still showing
some interest, yeah?

608
00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:13,326
She looks at me sometimes,
but we're not allowed to talk

609
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,795
in the class,
so I can't say anything.

610
00:27:15,828 --> 00:27:17,597
And then when we go out
to the playground,

611
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,366
she always goes off
with the other girls.

612
00:27:21,168 --> 00:27:23,302
Anyways, I think
she loves that other fella.

613
00:27:23,336 --> 00:27:25,772
Ah, you don't know that
for sure.

614
00:27:25,805 --> 00:27:27,840
Women are very mysterious.

615
00:27:27,874 --> 00:27:30,510
And women can smash
your face in, too, mister.

616
00:27:30,543 --> 00:27:33,713
Your granny's become
less mysterious over the years.

617
00:27:33,746 --> 00:27:35,381
So, you really like her?

618
00:27:35,414 --> 00:27:38,351
When I grow up,
I want to marry her.

619
00:27:38,384 --> 00:27:40,620
Yeah, sounds like
you really like her.

620
00:27:40,653 --> 00:27:43,456
You know,
she's not only at school.

621
00:27:43,489 --> 00:27:46,492
You could see
where she lives maybe.

622
00:27:46,526 --> 00:27:48,795
It's Reynolds Drive,
four houses in from the right,

623
00:27:48,828 --> 00:27:50,062
the one with the wonky eight.

624
00:27:50,096 --> 00:27:52,064
Oh, you've done your research.

625
00:27:52,098 --> 00:27:54,667
I pass it every day
on my way home.

626
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,703
I try to look in,

783
00:34:27,092 --> 00:34:30,829
And if it gets you moved up by
one seat to bask in the light

784
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:33,098
of her glory,
then you're off to the races.

785
00:34:33,133 --> 00:34:35,768
But sure there's only one
right answer.

786
00:34:35,801 --> 00:34:37,237
If that were true, son,
people wouldn't be

787
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:40,005
blowing themselves up
all over this town.

788
00:34:43,943 --> 00:34:47,112
I think my da wants us
to leave Belfast.

789
00:34:51,551 --> 00:34:53,886
What do you want?

790
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:58,491
Every night, before I go to
sleep, when I say my prayers,

791
00:34:58,525 --> 00:35:01,194
I ask God if he'd fix it
so that when I wake up

792
00:35:01,228 --> 00:35:04,497
in the morning, I'm the best
footballer in the world.

793
00:35:04,531 --> 00:35:07,032
And then I also ask him as well

794
00:35:07,066 --> 00:35:09,935
that when I grow up,
can I marry Catherine.

795
00:35:09,969 --> 00:35:11,837
Even if she loves Ronnie Boyd.

796
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:14,441
But she could still see him,
but she'd marry me.

797
00:35:14,474 --> 00:35:16,309
That's what I want.

798

810
00:35:46,306 --> 00:35:48,208

well, then don't blame me

Get inside now.

830
00:36:30,216 --> 00:36:32,918
And finally a switch in
the medal positions this week.

831
00:36:32,951 --> 00:36:34,387
Well, Mr. Buddy,
you may not have improved

832
00:36:34,421 --> 00:36:37,056
your handwriting in maths,
for which this once,

833
00:36:37,089 --> 00:36:39,192
in lieu of your intensified
efforts, we will be willing

834
00:36:39,225 --> 00:36:40,859
to give you
the benefit of the doubt,

835
00:36:40,893 --> 00:36:43,463
but you have
improved your score.

836
00:36:43,496 --> 00:36:47,300
So, in second position
is Buddy.

When is your next chance?

857
00:37:51,231 --> 00:37:54,234
We have to do a project
about the moon landing.

858
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:56,369
What, did those boys
not come back from that?

859
00:37:56,403 --> 00:37:59,539
They did, and now we have to
cut things out of the papers

860
00:37:59,572 --> 00:38:01,374
and explain how they got there.

861
00:38:01,408 --> 00:38:03,510
If they did get there,
if they did get to the moon.

862
00:38:03,543 --> 00:38:05,077
It's not what it says here.

863

God doesn't like it.

864
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,082
And I watched every night, too,
that they were up there,

and how did I never see
Mike Collins

866
00:38:12,017 --> 00:38:14,354
in the mother ship
doing his orbit?

867
00:38:14,387 --> 00:38:16,222
Sure you would have seen
the shape of Columbus

868
00:38:16,256 --> 00:38:17,690
against the light of the moon.

869
00:38:17,724 --> 00:38:19,426
No, that's 'cause mostly
he was on the dark side.

870
00:38:19,459 --> 00:38:22,128
Exactly. It's the side that
Lucifer hangs his shillelagh.

871
00:38:22,162 --> 00:38:24,497
What? No, look, he was
on the dark side of the moon

872
00:38:24,531 --> 00:38:26,566
most of the time where
we couldn't see him, you know,

873
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:29,135
while he was doing his orbit,
and then maybe, you know,

874
00:38:29,169 --> 00:38:31,171
just before he was due
to come round the corner,

875
00:38:31,204 --> 00:38:33,005
you had to go in for your tea.

876
00:38:33,038 --> 00:38:35,308
If I could come up with
something smart about that,

877
00:38:35,341 --> 00:38:37,310
maybe I could
stay up at the top desk

878
00:38:37,343 --> 00:38:39,179
and wait till
she gets back there.

879
00:38:39,212 --> 00:38:41,147
Or you could say the moon's
made of green cheese

880
00:38:41,181 --> 00:38:42,715
and drop down a place,
if you wanted.

881
00:38:42,749 --> 00:38:44,184
Or you could do
the project together,

882
00:38:44,217 --> 00:38:45,984
you and the young lady.

883
00:38:46,018 --> 00:38:47,253
You'd get the same marks

884
00:38:47,287 --> 00:38:49,489
and maybe end up
on the same seat together.

Hey, Romeo, come on!

917
00:40:24,851 --> 00:40:26,586
It's simple.
We go into the shop

918
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:28,454
and keep Mr. Singh talking
down by the fridge.

919
00:40:28,488 --> 00:40:30,557
He has to move the boxes
round at the bottom

920
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,858
to get me a Lemon Mivvi.

921
00:40:31,891 --> 00:40:33,793
His head'll be down
part of the time.

922
00:40:33,826 --> 00:40:35,595
You stay at the front
of the shop,

923
00:40:35,628 --> 00:40:39,165
and when you see he's not
looking, you make a sweep.

- What's a sweep?
- A big grab for all the chocolate bars

on that low shelf
near the till.

926

Sure he'll know they've been
nicked if there's a big gap.

I thought you said
we'd just do a couple,

00:40:47,607 --> 00:40:49,175
so he'd never even notice.

by the police.

MOIRA: Please may I have
a Lemon Mivvi?

938
00:41:07,794 --> 00:41:09,228
MR. SINGH:
Lemon Mivvi coming right up.

939
00:41:09,262 --> 00:41:11,464
Just need to move
a few wee boxes.

940
00:41:11,497 --> 00:41:12,432
- Hey!
- (screams)

941
00:41:12,465 --> 00:41:14,400
- He's seen us!
- Come here, you wee buggers!

942
00:41:14,434 --> 00:41:16,569
- I know who you are!
- MOIRA: No, he doesn't!

943
00:41:16,603 --> 00:41:19,872
BUDDY: Well, your woman
will tell him anyway!

944
00:41:19,906 --> 00:41:21,507
- You proud of yourself?
- It was Moira.

945
00:41:21,541 --> 00:41:22,675
Get in there.

946
00:41:22,709 --> 00:41:24,911
MAN: Get off that blinking road
or you'll kill somebody!

947
00:41:24,944 --> 00:41:26,746
She's gonna tell on us!

948
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:28,881
She says anything,
she's done for!

949
00:41:28,915 --> 00:41:30,583
WOMAN:
I know who youse are!

950
00:41:30,617 --> 00:41:32,652
(both panting)

951
00:41:35,855 --> 00:41:38,157
What have you got?

952
00:41:38,191 --> 00:41:40,727
You're joking me.

953
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,228
It's all I could see.

954
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:43,763
Turkish Delight?

955
00:41:43,796 --> 00:41:45,531
Who the hell
eats Turkish Delight?

956
00:41:45,565 --> 00:41:47,867
- Do you eat Turkish Delight?
- No.

957
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,435
I don't like it.

958
00:41:49,469 --> 00:41:51,938
Nobody likes it.

959
00:41:51,971 --> 00:41:54,273
- It's all they had.
- Are you blind?

960
00:41:54,307 --> 00:41:55,742
I had to think quickly.

961
00:41:55,775 --> 00:41:57,276
Not quickly enough.

962
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,912
There was Flakes and Crunchies.

963
00:41:59,946 --> 00:42:02,448
All you need is an in and out
with a fast hand,

964
00:42:02,482 --> 00:42:04,784
and then the Milky Bars
are on me.

965
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:06,486
I'm not sure
you're cut out for this.

966
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:09,255
- (bicycle bell dings)
- Hey, Buddy, your da's home.

967
00:42:09,288 --> 00:42:12,392
- Sure it's only Wednesday.
- He came in a taxi.

968
00:42:13,292 --> 00:42:15,294
- And you, too!
- What?

969
00:42:15,328 --> 00:42:17,530
Keep your mouth shut.

970
00:42:22,602 --> 00:42:24,737
PA:
When did you write to them?

971
00:42:24,771 --> 00:42:26,272
MA:
None of your business.

972
00:42:26,305 --> 00:42:27,607
PA: Just tell me.
When did you write to them?

973
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,975
- It's a simple question.
- None of your business.

974
00:42:29,008 --> 00:42:30,710
PA:
Just give me a simple answer.

975
00:42:30,743 --> 00:42:33,346
- I'm not getting interrogated.
- When did you write to them?

976
00:42:33,379 --> 00:42:34,814
MA: When the last receipt
came through.

977
00:42:34,847 --> 00:42:36,883
I knew it was the last one
'cause for three bloody years

978
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:38,384
I've been counting
them envelopes

979
00:42:38,418 --> 00:42:39,819
coming through that door,
and there wasn't

980
00:42:39,852 --> 00:42:41,287
so much as a thank-you
with this one.

981
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,922
PA: It's the taxman,
for God's sake.

982
00:42:42,955 --> 00:42:44,424
Who do you expect,
Father Christmas?

983
00:42:44,457 --> 00:42:46,292
MA: We've been
scrimping and saving,

984
00:42:46,325 --> 00:42:48,561
and they hadn't the good grace
as to say, "That's it.

985
00:42:48,594 --> 00:42:50,263
You're done.
You're in the clear."

986
00:42:50,296 --> 00:42:52,265
So what'd you say to them
in your letter?

987
00:42:52,298 --> 00:42:55,234
I said I wanted
a full official declaration

988
00:42:55,268 --> 00:42:57,437
that my husband was
in the clear a hundred percent

989
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:00,273
on all back taxes,
and that they acknowledged

990
00:43:00,306 --> 00:43:02,842
that everything was shipshape
and above board,

991
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:04,310
and that my family's good name

992
00:43:04,343 --> 00:43:06,279
wasn't on
some credit risk list.

993
00:43:06,312 --> 00:43:08,781
- Christ. Christ the night.
- What?

994
00:43:12,852 --> 00:43:14,353
No.

995
00:43:14,387 --> 00:43:16,422
- No.
- Yes, yes, oh, yes.

996
00:43:16,456 --> 00:43:18,658
They've decided... thanks
to acting on your request...

997
00:43:18,691 --> 00:43:21,427
they've decided to go back
further into my accounts

998
00:43:21,461 --> 00:43:23,596
and say that I owe
another 572 pound,

999
00:43:23,629 --> 00:43:25,331
which based on
current earnings,

1000
00:43:25,364 --> 00:43:27,033
should take another
five years to pay off.

1001
00:43:27,066 --> 00:43:29,001
So it's a handy wee letter
you sent, wasn't it?

1002
00:43:29,035 --> 00:43:30,536
You bugger!

1003
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:32,505
- Oh, you're a lying bugger!
- (dish shatters)

1004
00:43:32,538 --> 00:43:34,974
Aye, that's right, believe the
taxman before you believe me!

1005
00:43:35,007 --> 00:43:37,510
'Cause I know you! (grunts)

1006
00:43:39,312 --> 00:43:40,913
Your work won't be too pleased

1007
00:43:40,947 --> 00:43:43,683
with you skipping off
in the week.

1008
00:43:43,716 --> 00:43:44,917
I'll work the weekend.

1009
00:43:44,951 --> 00:43:46,953
Ah, when's that job finish?

1010
00:43:46,986 --> 00:43:48,588
This one's nearly done.

1011
00:43:48,621 --> 00:43:51,357
What, there's another one
over there, is there?

1012
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:52,959
Aye. Big one.

1013
00:43:52,992 --> 00:43:54,694
A long one.

1014
00:43:54,727 --> 00:43:56,763
They're asking some of the boys
to move over permanent.

1015
00:43:56,796 --> 00:43:59,565
Offering accommodation
because of the time involved.

1016
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:00,867
Couple of years.

1017
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,668
Building a hospital.

1018
00:44:02,702 --> 00:44:04,904
Your father has to go
to the hospital.

1019
00:44:04,937 --> 00:44:06,405
You talk to him about it.

1020
00:44:06,439 --> 00:44:08,307
Won't talk to me about doctors.

1021
00:44:08,341 --> 00:44:09,442
Is that right?

1022
00:44:09,475 --> 00:44:11,444
Ah, it's just a couple of days.

1023
00:44:11,477 --> 00:44:13,613
A wee test for the lungs.

1024
00:44:13,646 --> 00:44:15,915
It's all that bloody time
over in Leicester.

1025
00:44:15,948 --> 00:44:18,050
- Where's that?
- In England.

1026
00:44:18,084 --> 00:44:19,719
Is that near where Daddy works?

1027
00:44:19,752 --> 00:44:22,421
Nah, your daddy works near,
uh, London, the Big Smoke.

1028
00:44:22,455 --> 00:44:24,791
This was in the countryside.

1029
00:44:24,824 --> 00:44:26,325
What were you doing?

1030
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:27,693
I was a coal miner.

1031
00:44:27,727 --> 00:44:29,729
You've done a lot
of different jobs, Pop.

1032
00:44:29,762 --> 00:44:30,997
You can say that again.

1033
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:33,800
Yeah, none of them lasted
more than a week.

1034
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:34,934
(Granny chuckles)

1035
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:37,036
My mother's worried about you.

1036
00:44:37,069 --> 00:44:39,405
Your mother's worried about you.

1037
00:44:40,373 --> 00:44:43,609
Well, Granny's always worried
about something, isn't she?

1038
00:44:43,643 --> 00:44:46,546
Ah, well, your granny's
a very caring person.

1039
00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:48,815
Sometimes it affects her nerves.

1040
00:44:48,848 --> 00:44:50,049
Like your mommy.

1041
00:44:50,082 --> 00:44:52,852
Mommy's worried, too, isn't she?

1042
00:44:55,822 --> 00:44:59,692
Daddy, are we gonna
have to leave Belfast?

1043
00:45:01,894 --> 00:45:04,697
PA: All right, Buddy,
that's me away, then.

1044
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:06,365
I'll see you
when I get back next week.

1045
00:45:06,399 --> 00:45:07,900
MISS LEWIS: In you come, girls.
Catherine. Quinn.

1046
00:45:07,934 --> 00:45:09,936
Come on in, girls. You can help
put the pencils out.

1047
00:45:09,969 --> 00:45:11,838
PA:
Be good, son.

1048
00:45:11,871 --> 00:45:13,105
If you can't be good?

1049
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,541
BOTH:
Be careful.

1050
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,044
BILLY:
Seems like only yesterday

1051
00:45:18,077 --> 00:45:20,613
you and me were
in school together.

1052
00:45:20,646 --> 00:45:23,583
You're gonna need to stay
away from my family.

1053
00:45:23,616 --> 00:45:25,785
BILLY: That's big talk
for a fella who's never here.

1054
00:45:25,818 --> 00:45:28,155
PA: You can rely on me
to be here when it matters.

1055
00:45:28,188 --> 00:45:29,856
BILLY:
I hope your timing's good.

1056
00:45:29,889 --> 00:45:32,859
Things get out of hand
pretty quick round these parts.

1057
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,830
Do you know the problem
with men like you?

1058
00:45:37,864 --> 00:45:40,032
You think you're better
than the rest of us.

1059
00:45:40,066 --> 00:45:43,703
And the problem with men like
you is you know you're not.

1060
00:45:46,038 --> 00:45:47,807
We'll keep it simple.

1061
00:45:49,075 --> 00:45:51,477
You're with us
or you're against us.

1062
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:52,745
Clock's ticking.

1063
00:45:52,778 --> 00:45:53,613
You're a soft touch!

1064
00:45:53,646 --> 00:45:56,048
Time for real Protestants
to step up!

1065
00:45:56,082 --> 00:45:57,650
PA:
Ach, you're no real Protestant.

1066
00:45:57,683 --> 00:46:00,653
You're a jumped-up gangster
and always were.

1067
00:46:17,536 --> 00:46:19,438
MAN: There's peelers about.
Hey, watch it, youse two.

1068
00:46:19,472 --> 00:46:20,940
WOMAN:
Quick.

1069
00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:25,711
(knocking)

1070
00:46:28,948 --> 00:46:31,918
MA: Ah, look.
There you are now, son.

1071
00:46:31,951 --> 00:46:33,953
There he is now. (chuckles)

1072
00:46:35,821 --> 00:46:37,123
(door closes)

1073
00:46:37,157 --> 00:46:38,858
Hello, son.

1074
00:46:38,891 --> 00:46:41,194
The police officer here
just wants a wee word with you.

1075
00:46:41,228 --> 00:46:42,929
There seems to be
a-a wee bit of confusion

1076
00:46:42,962 --> 00:46:45,464
about something that happened
at Mr. Singh's.

1077
00:46:45,498 --> 00:46:47,700
Go on, sit down there, now.

1078
00:46:52,772 --> 00:46:55,741
POLICEMAN:
Do you know why I'm here, son?

1079
00:46:55,775 --> 00:46:57,944
Don't lie to me.

1080
00:46:57,977 --> 00:46:59,979
A very serious crime
has been committed

1081
00:47:00,012 --> 00:47:01,547
down in Mr. Singh's shop.

1082
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,849
Do you know
what I'm talking about?

1083
00:47:04,684 --> 00:47:06,852
(Ma and policeman laugh)

1084
00:47:06,886 --> 00:47:09,555
All the best, now,
and give my regards to Josie.

1085
00:47:09,588 --> 00:47:11,824
- POLICEMAN: I will do.
- I do like a man in a uniform.

1086
00:47:11,857 --> 00:47:14,227
Was he in there long?
(chuckles)

1087
00:47:14,261 --> 00:47:17,164
Apples'll grow again, should
they grow on a gooseberry tree!

1088
00:47:17,197 --> 00:47:18,998
I didn't even
eat the chocolate!

1089
00:47:19,031 --> 00:47:22,568
AMY KANE (over TV): No, I won't
be here when it's over.

1090
00:47:22,601 --> 00:47:24,271
You're asking me
to wait an hour to find out

1091
00:47:24,304 --> 00:47:26,273
if I'm going to be
a wife or a widow.

1092
00:47:26,306 --> 00:47:28,107
I say it's too long to wait.

1093
00:47:28,141 --> 00:47:29,742
- I won't do it.
- WILL KANE: Amy...

1094
00:47:29,775 --> 00:47:31,978
I mean it.
If you won't go with me now,

1095
00:47:32,011 --> 00:47:34,747
I'll be on that train
when it leaves here.

1096
00:47:35,881 --> 00:47:37,550
I've got to stay.

1097
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:39,585
No, you're not listening to me.

I am listening. I am listening.

Would you, would you listen
to me for a change?

1100
00:47:43,223 --> 00:47:44,957
I'm trying to be practical
about this.

MA: Look, the police were here
today but their father wasn't,

1102
00:47:46,892 --> 00:47:48,561
so, no, I'll not be
having any lectures

1103
00:47:48,594 --> 00:47:49,996

How many was there?

1148
00:49:45,312 --> 00:49:47,646
About ten of them.

1149
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,015
And what did your mate do?

1150
00:49:50,049 --> 00:49:53,786
He said he wasn't joining
anything they belonged to.

1151
00:49:53,819 --> 00:49:57,157
Then he gave the big one a dig
in the gob and ran like hell.

1152
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:59,125
So did I.

1153
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:00,960
Did they chase you?

1154
00:50:00,993 --> 00:50:02,995
Aye, but we got
a street ahead of them.

1155
00:50:03,028 --> 00:50:05,365
Then we ran into me Uncle
Tony's and turned the corner

1156
00:50:05,398 --> 00:50:07,334
before they could see us.

1157
00:50:07,367 --> 00:50:09,436
We put the heart across
me Uncle Tony.

1158
00:50:09,469 --> 00:50:11,670
He was on the toilet,
doing his horses,

1159
00:50:11,704 --> 00:50:14,207
and then he dropped his pencil
down the loo.

1160
00:50:15,007 --> 00:50:18,077
You've delivered
for these boys before, aye?

1161
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:19,912
Mm-hmm.

1162
00:50:19,945 --> 00:50:21,814
And you know it's not milk
they're putting

1163
00:50:21,847 --> 00:50:24,284
back in them empty bottles?

1164
00:50:24,317 --> 00:50:26,085
I do now, Daddy.

1165
00:50:28,188 --> 00:50:30,257
You were right to tell me.

1166
00:50:32,925 --> 00:50:35,094
Come here and hold this, son.

1167
00:50:36,263 --> 00:50:37,930
Hold that there.

1168
00:50:42,135 --> 00:50:44,003

- Sydney.
- Australia?

1175
00:50:58,418 --> 00:50:59,985
Aye, that's right.

1176
00:51:00,019 --> 00:51:01,787
- Do you know about it?
- Aye.

1177
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,490
They've got surfing
and weird football.

1178
00:51:03,523 --> 00:51:05,325
And they have kangaroos
on the barbecue.

down there, too.

That's right.

What?

1184
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,268
Moving over there
for a wee while.

1185
00:51:15,302 --> 00:51:16,802
You're joking.

1186
00:51:16,835 --> 00:51:18,471
No. It's just down the side
a wee bit.

1187
00:51:18,505 --> 00:51:20,207

the moon if we went down there.

1191
00:51:29,982 --> 00:51:31,484
Sure, you've already
family there.

1192
00:51:31,518 --> 00:51:32,851
One second cousin.

1193
00:51:32,885 --> 00:51:34,086
And you've the phone.

1194
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:37,157
And a millionaire
to pay the bills?

1195
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:38,791
We could take trips back.

1196
00:51:38,824 --> 00:51:40,893
And pay for it with what,
Scotch mist?

1197
00:51:40,926 --> 00:51:42,995
Family could come over
for holidays.

I didn't come up the loch

can afford the fare
to go down there.

1201
00:51:47,866 --> 00:51:50,002
Or the time off work,
if they had any work.

1202

more money straightaway.

all our lives.

And you say you've
a wee garden for them boys?

1348

understand a word we say.

1353
00:58:33,473 --> 00:58:36,743
And half of them,
they'll take the hand out of us

1354
00:58:36,776 --> 00:58:39,345
for sounding different.

1355
00:58:39,379 --> 00:58:43,282
And the other half,
they'll hate us

1356
00:58:43,316 --> 00:58:46,386
'cause men here are killing
their young sons on our streets.

1357

They'll think
we don't give a shite.

And you think they're gonna
welcome us with open arms?

What, and say, "Come on in.

the house off of us"?

1400
01:01:21,874 --> 01:01:23,009
He's no money, either.

1401
01:01:23,042 --> 01:01:25,945
Taxman's got it, like ours.

1402
01:01:25,978 --> 01:01:27,647
Ach, don't worry.

1403
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,750
Your mammy will persuade Santa
to bring some presents.

1404
01:01:30,783 --> 01:01:32,985
Ach. Don't think so, Pop.

1405
01:01:33,019 --> 01:01:34,554
I always know
when there's no money.

1406
01:01:34,587 --> 01:01:35,888
- <i>(knocking)</i>
- MAN: <i>Hello?</i>

1407
01:01:35,922 --> 01:01:38,057
- It's the rent man.
- BUDDY: I'll get it, Mam.

1408
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:39,826
Shut your mouth.

1409
01:01:39,859 --> 01:01:42,628
Is your mum in there, wee man?

1410
01:01:42,662 --> 01:01:43,696
Nobody's here.

1411
01:01:43,729 --> 01:01:45,431
- (muffled shouting)
- (knocking)

1412
01:01:45,464 --> 01:01:47,834
Oh, that puts me in mind
of a great wee system

1413
01:01:47,867 --> 01:01:50,536
we had in the old days
for paying the rent.

1414
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:53,606
The rent man would come round
and collect the money

1415
01:01:53,639 --> 01:01:55,875
for every house
in the whole street,

1416
01:01:55,908 --> 01:01:57,810
and once he had done

1417
01:01:57,844 --> 01:02:01,113
and all the rent books
were marked up to date,

1418
01:02:01,148 --> 01:02:03,683
one of the boys would
hold him up at gunpoint

1419
01:02:03,716 --> 01:02:05,384
in the back entry

1420
01:02:05,418 --> 01:02:07,453
and take all the money
back off him,

1421
01:02:07,486 --> 01:02:09,989
and then he'd hand it
straight back

1422
01:02:10,022 --> 01:02:12,024
to all the residents
in the street,

1423
01:02:12,058 --> 01:02:14,594
with a little commission
for the service.

1424
01:02:14,627 --> 01:02:18,397
Yeah, it was
a very effective system.

1425
01:02:18,431 --> 01:02:20,766
And the rent man was
so good about it in the end

1426
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,502
that eventually they cut him in
for a wee bit, too,

1427
01:02:23,536 --> 01:02:26,005
and everybody was happy.

1428
01:02:26,038 --> 01:02:28,708
Except for the council,
I suppose.

1429
01:02:28,741 --> 01:02:31,677
His work's giving my da a house
in England now if he wants one.

1430
01:02:31,711 --> 01:02:33,880
It's got a garden
and everything,

1431
01:02:33,913 --> 01:02:36,816
and two toilets, and they're
both inside the house.

1432
01:02:36,849 --> 01:02:39,186
There's nothing wrong
with an outside toilet,

1433
01:02:39,219 --> 01:02:41,053
except on an aeroplane.

1434
01:02:41,087 --> 01:02:42,755
(chuckles)

1435
01:02:42,788 --> 01:02:45,658
My ma says,
if we went across the water,

1436
01:02:45,691 --> 01:02:48,027
they wouldn't understand
the way we talk.

1437
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,562
That shouldn't be
a problem, son.

1438
01:02:49,595 --> 01:02:51,564
I've been married
to your granny for 50 years.

1439
01:02:51,597 --> 01:02:54,634
I've never understood
a word she's said.

1440
01:02:54,667 --> 01:02:56,903
And if they can't
understand you,

1441
01:02:56,936 --> 01:03:00,606
then they're not listening,
and that's their problem.

1442
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,175
You know, when I was
in Leicester,

1443
01:03:02,209 --> 01:03:03,910
they said the same thing
about me.

1444
01:03:03,943 --> 01:03:07,580
You know, so I put on
a different bloody accent

1445
01:03:07,613 --> 01:03:09,448
every day just to annoy them.

1446
01:03:09,482 --> 01:03:11,151
They never knew who I was.

1447
01:03:11,184 --> 01:03:12,718
But I did,

1448
01:03:12,752 --> 01:03:16,522
and that's the only one
who needs to know.

1449
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:19,192
You know who you are, don't you?

1450
01:03:19,226 --> 01:03:20,960
Yes, Pop.

1451
01:03:20,993 --> 01:03:25,498
You're Buddy from Belfast 15,

1452
01:03:25,531 --> 01:03:27,466
where everybody knows you

1453
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,069
and your pop looks out for you

1454
01:03:30,102 --> 01:03:31,871
and your mummy looks out
for you,

1455
01:03:31,904 --> 01:03:34,607
your daddy looks out for you,
your granny looks out for you,

1456
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,942
your brother looks out for you,

1457
01:03:35,975 --> 01:03:39,612
and the whole family
looks out for you.

1458
01:03:39,645 --> 01:03:44,550
And wherever you go
and whatever you become,

1459
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:47,187
that'll always be the truth.

1460
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:50,089
And that thought
will keep you safe.

1461
01:03:50,122 --> 01:03:52,692
It'll keep you happy.

1462
01:03:52,725 --> 01:03:54,261
Will you remember that for me?

1463
01:03:54,294 --> 01:03:56,929
- Yes, Pop.
- Aye.

1464
01:03:56,963 --> 01:03:59,232
Fine man you are.

1465
01:03:59,266 --> 01:04:01,734
Now, forget about

1466
01:04:01,767 --> 01:04:04,870
what your father
and your mother want.

1467
01:04:04,904 --> 01:04:06,772
What do you want?

1468
01:04:07,473 --> 01:04:10,743
I want you
and my granny to come, too.

1469
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:29,296
- (bell tolling)
- (howling)

1470
01:04:29,329 --> 01:04:31,630
GHOST (in play):
<i>Hear me.</i>

1471
01:04:32,265 --> 01:04:35,135
Hear me.

1472
01:04:35,168 --> 01:04:37,870
I am here tonight to warn you

1473
01:04:37,903 --> 01:04:41,874
that you have yet
a chance and hope

1474
01:04:41,907 --> 01:04:43,743
of escaping my fate.

1475
01:04:43,776 --> 01:04:46,078
Who wears chains that size?

1476
01:04:46,112 --> 01:04:48,748
(whispers): Granny, you're not
allowed to talk in the theater.

1477
01:04:48,781 --> 01:04:50,583
It makes one heck of a necklace.

1478
01:04:50,616 --> 01:04:53,220
You were always
a good friend to me.

1479
01:04:53,253 --> 01:04:55,222
Thank you.

1480
01:04:55,255 --> 01:04:58,924
You will be haunted.

1481
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,332
Is this the chance and hope
you mentioned, Jacob?

1482
01:05:05,365 --> 01:05:07,234
It is.

1483
01:05:07,267 --> 01:05:09,602
I think I'd rather not.

1484
01:05:09,635 --> 01:05:11,804
Oh, I'm bloody well sure
you wouldn't.

1485
01:05:13,072 --> 01:05:15,107
(engine chugging and whirring)

1486
01:05:26,852 --> 01:05:29,722
When will Pop get out
of the hospital?

1487
01:05:29,755 --> 01:05:33,059
When the doctors say
his lungs are fine.

1488
01:05:33,092 --> 01:05:35,661
When Pop went to England
to be a coal miner,

1489
01:05:35,694 --> 01:05:37,663
did you go with him?

1490
01:05:39,899 --> 01:05:41,834
Did you want to?

1491
01:05:45,205 --> 01:05:47,573
Neither do I.

1492
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:52,111
Has your father said
what he's doing?

1493
01:05:53,779 --> 01:05:57,184
He says it has to get decided
by Christmas.

1494
01:05:57,217 --> 01:05:58,684
When's he coming back?

1495
01:05:58,717 --> 01:05:59,819
At the weekend.

1496
01:05:59,852 --> 01:06:01,354
We're going to the pictures.

1497
01:06:01,388 --> 01:06:03,856
He's taking us to
<i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.</i>

1498
01:06:03,889 --> 01:06:05,724
What in the name of God is that?

1499
01:06:05,758 --> 01:06:06,692
It's a flying car.

1500
01:06:06,725 --> 01:06:08,261
Oh, God, I've heard it all.

1501
01:06:08,295 --> 01:06:11,198
It goes over a cliff, and you
nearly fall out of your seat.

1502
01:06:11,231 --> 01:06:12,698
Do you want to come?

1503
01:06:12,731 --> 01:06:14,934
It'll be company for you
till my pop's home.

1504
01:06:14,967 --> 01:06:16,969
If God had wanted me
to see flying cars,

1505
01:06:17,002 --> 01:06:19,172
I'd have been born
with blinking wings.

1506
01:06:19,206 --> 01:06:20,840
(Granny chuckling)

1507
01:06:20,873 --> 01:06:22,942
You love your films, don't you?

1508
01:06:23,776 --> 01:06:28,714
I was a great one for the
pictures when I was your age.

1509
01:06:28,747 --> 01:06:31,117
I used to think you could
climb right inside the screen

1510
01:06:31,151 --> 01:06:34,120
and visit all those
strange places you saw.

1511
01:06:34,154 --> 01:06:36,423
(chuckles)
Like that one in that film.

1512
01:06:36,456 --> 01:06:38,225
What was that, uh...?

1513
01:06:38,258 --> 01:06:39,658
Uh, <i>Lost Horizons.</i>

1514
01:06:39,692 --> 01:06:41,294
- Did you ever see that?
- No.

1515
01:06:41,328 --> 01:06:43,196
What was the name
of the place, Granny?

1516
01:06:45,165 --> 01:06:46,732
Shangri-La.

1517
01:06:46,765 --> 01:06:48,667
That's what they called it.

1518
01:06:48,701 --> 01:06:50,903
Did you ever go there?

1519
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:57,877
There were no roads
to Shangri-La

1520
01:06:57,910 --> 01:07:00,646
from our part of Belfast.

1521
01:07:02,415 --> 01:07:04,417
So, will you go one day?

1522
01:07:04,451 --> 01:07:06,253
(chuckles softly)

1523
01:07:07,454 --> 01:07:10,022
(chuckling)

1524
01:07:10,055 --> 01:07:12,159
(sighs)

1525
01:07:18,431 --> 01:07:20,433
- (bell jingles)
- (kids shouting)

1526
01:07:20,467 --> 01:07:23,068
What? Where do they think
they're going?

1527
01:07:23,102 --> 01:07:24,803
(gasps) Look out!

1528
01:07:24,837 --> 01:07:27,039
(tires squealing)

1529
01:07:27,072 --> 01:07:30,009
(characters and audience
screaming)

1530
01:07:33,946 --> 01:07:35,482
TRULY (in movie):
What's happening?

1531
01:07:35,515 --> 01:07:37,384
CHILD (in movie):
Look!

1532
01:07:37,417 --> 01:07:38,918
- Oh!
- Look at that!

1533
01:07:38,951 --> 01:07:41,787
It's fantastic. (gasps)

1534
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:43,822
- (kids shouting excitedly)
- TRULY: You're a genius.

1535
01:07:43,856 --> 01:07:45,057
(Caractacus chuckling in movie)

1536
01:07:45,090 --> 01:07:47,793
CARACTACUS:
It's nothing, really.

We've a wee word
to have with you.

1572
01:08:59,132 --> 01:09:03,068
Buddy, uh, Mum and I want
to talk to you about something,

1573
01:09:03,102 --> 01:09:06,139
something that we might
have to do as a family.

1574
01:09:06,972 --> 01:09:09,875
You know the way your dad's
over in England

1575
01:09:09,908 --> 01:09:12,545
and he's been working
over there for quite a while?

1576
01:09:12,579 --> 01:09:15,814
Well, we were thinking that,
uh, you know,

1577
01:09:15,848 --> 01:09:18,518
maybe we'd all go as a family
and go live there.

1578
01:09:18,551 --> 01:09:20,220
(Buddy whimpers softly)

1579
01:09:20,253 --> 01:09:24,023
And, um, your dad's seen
a really nice wee house,

1580
01:09:24,056 --> 01:09:26,925
and it's got
a lovely garden and...

1581
01:09:26,959 --> 01:09:28,461
Play football, Buddy.

1582
01:09:28,495 --> 01:09:30,297
- Aye.
- There's loads of room there.

1583
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:32,232
- More room than we have here.
- (Buddy cries)

1584
01:09:32,265 --> 01:09:34,434
- I don't want to go to England!
- Could you switch that off?

1585
01:09:34,467 --> 01:09:35,934
I don't want to go to England!

1586
01:09:35,968 --> 01:09:37,069
It's all right, darling.

1587
01:09:37,102 --> 01:09:38,438
- Hey, it's okay.
- It's all right.

1588
01:09:38,471 --> 01:09:40,373
I'll have no friends
and no cousins,

1589
01:09:40,407 --> 01:09:42,975
and I won't be able
to see Catherine at school!

1590
01:09:43,008 --> 01:09:44,843
Hey, listen, you'll make new
friends, and you're gonna have

1591
01:09:44,877 --> 01:09:46,313
a big garden
to play football in.

1592
01:09:46,346 --> 01:09:47,880
I don't care about the garden!

1593
01:09:47,913 --> 01:09:49,316
I want my granny and my pop,

1594
01:09:49,349 --> 01:09:51,618
and I want to do my project
on going to the moon

1595
01:09:51,651 --> 01:09:53,620
and get on the first desk,
and I don't want to

1596
01:09:53,653 --> 01:09:55,221
- have to talk funny.
- Hey, hey, Buddy.

1597
01:09:55,255 --> 01:09:57,022
And I don't want to forget
what road I have to

1598
01:09:57,056 --> 01:09:58,224
- go down when I'm dead.
- That's enough now, darling.

1599
01:09:58,258 --> 01:10:00,059
No one's asking you
to talk funny.

1600
01:10:00,092 --> 01:10:01,594
- No decision's been made yet.
- It's all right. Exactly.

1601
01:10:01,628 --> 01:10:03,229
No, we were just trying to see
what everyone thought first.

1602
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:05,030
- You're just overtired.
- Exactly. Yeah.

1603
01:10:05,064 --> 01:10:07,900
I don't want to leave Belfast!

1607
01:10:35,961 --> 01:10:38,665
- See where we are then.
- (sighs): Aye.

1608
01:10:38,698 --> 01:10:41,066
These boys are suffering.

1609
01:10:42,669 --> 01:10:45,138
I don't think we've got
till Easter.

1610
01:10:48,107 --> 01:10:51,043
I don't think you and me
have got till Easter, either.

1611
01:10:56,316 --> 01:10:58,984
Well, come home.

1612
01:10:59,017 --> 01:11:01,187
We'll fight this together.

1614
01:11:04,089 --> 01:11:06,292
are getting killed
around the corner.

1615
01:11:08,361 --> 01:11:10,896
Well, we'll be careful.

1616
01:11:12,265 --> 01:11:15,235
You can't be with them
24 hours a day.

1617
01:11:16,034 --> 01:11:18,904
You can't take away
their childhood, either.

1618
01:11:28,181 --> 01:11:32,218
You know, whatever happens...

1619
01:11:34,621 --> 01:11:37,590
...what you've done
with these two,

1620
01:11:37,624 --> 01:11:39,925
it's phenomenal.

1622
01:11:46,599 --> 01:11:48,535

1623
01:11:50,303 --> 01:11:52,037
Not me.

1624
01:11:52,639 --> 01:11:54,707
Not us.

1625
01:11:54,741 --> 01:11:56,543

1626
01:11:58,745 --> 01:12:00,979
Thank you.

1627
01:12:04,184 --> 01:12:06,419
We'll see what happens
by Easter.

1628

01:15:39,365 --> 01:15:41,534
MAN:
Lock the doors! Lock the doors!

1708
01:15:41,567 --> 01:15:43,403

01:15:49,942 --> 01:15:51,477
BUDDY:
Mammy! Mammy!

1711
01:15:51,511 --> 01:15:52,979
Here, what the hell's going on?

1712
01:15:53,012 --> 01:15:54,447
Oh, Mammy!

1713
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:55,982
We're looting the supermarket.

1714
01:15:56,015 --> 01:15:57,417
Where did you get that?

1715
01:15:57,450 --> 01:15:59,552
I told you, we're looting
the supermarket.

1716
01:15:59,585 --> 01:16:00,920
You're what?

1717
01:16:00,953 --> 01:16:03,189
You wait right there, young man.

1718
01:16:06,959 --> 01:16:09,595
Why did you take
that washing powder?

1719
01:16:09,629 --> 01:16:11,597
It's biological.

1720
01:16:11,631 --> 01:16:13,499
(Ma grunts angrily)

1721
01:16:16,669 --> 01:16:19,706
(helicopter whirring)

1722
01:16:19,739 --> 01:16:22,575

MA:
Come on.

1724
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:26,412
Move! Move it!

1725
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:30,383
You watch yourselves.

1726
01:16:31,384 --> 01:16:33,786
Now, you put that back.

1727
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:34,987
Do you hear me?

1728
01:16:35,021 --> 01:16:36,956
And if you ever,
ever do anything

1729
01:16:36,989 --> 01:16:38,491
like that again,
I will kill you.

1730
01:16:38,524 --> 01:16:40,359
Do you hear me?
And you, young madam,

1731
01:16:40,393 --> 01:16:42,562
if you ever drag my son
into something like this again,

1732
01:16:42,595 --> 01:16:45,898
I will beat you black and blue
until you never get home again.

1733
01:16:45,932 --> 01:16:47,533
Do you hear me?

1734
01:16:47,567 --> 01:16:49,736
All right? Put it back I said.

1735
01:16:49,769 --> 01:16:51,304
BILLY:
Hey, woman!

1736
01:16:51,337 --> 01:16:52,739
We don't put things back.

1737
01:16:52,772 --> 01:16:54,874
That's not the statement
we're trying to make.

1738
01:16:54,907 --> 01:16:57,343
MAN: Billy, come on.
The army are coming. Come on!

1739
01:16:57,376 --> 01:16:59,512
Out! Go on, get out!

1740
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:01,914
- Out!
- All right, all right.

1741
01:17:01,948 --> 01:17:04,283
- (sirens wailing)
- MAN: Come on!

1742
01:17:04,917 --> 01:17:06,419
(explosions)

1743
01:17:06,452 --> 01:17:08,287
SOLDIER (over speaker):
Clear the street!

1744
01:17:08,321 --> 01:17:09,622
Clear the street now!

1745
01:17:09,655 --> 01:17:12,625
Tear gas and rubber bullets
will be used!

1746
01:17:12,658 --> 01:17:14,861
We're clearing this area!
Move out the way now!

1747
01:17:14,894 --> 01:17:16,763
- BILLY: Time to get out of here.
- McLAURY: Don't try anything.

1748
01:17:16,796 --> 01:17:18,731
BILLY: So you two are going
to guarantee safe passage

1749
01:17:18,765 --> 01:17:20,032
for me and my men.

1750
01:17:20,066 --> 01:17:21,467
If you try to run,

1751
01:17:21,501 --> 01:17:23,302
I'll put a bullet
in your son's head.

1752
01:17:24,204 --> 01:17:26,272
- (clamoring continues)
- (solders shouting orders)

1753

(tires squeal)

1754
01:17:29,976 --> 01:17:32,044
BILLY: Ah, here he comes,
the Lone Ranger.

1755
01:17:32,078 --> 01:17:34,714
SOLDIER:
Clear this area right now!

1756
01:17:34,747 --> 01:17:37,784
I can see your kind needs
a little discipline.

1757
01:17:37,817 --> 01:17:39,786
You let them go now.

1758
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:42,088
No, I think if I do,

1759
01:17:42,121 --> 01:17:44,757
one of them soldiers
is gonna take my head off.

1760
01:17:45,725 --> 01:17:47,894
If they don't, I will.

1761
01:17:48,861 --> 01:17:51,597
Over their dead bodies.

Thanks.

It's gonna be all right.

1797
01:20:28,054 --> 01:20:32,692
I'll talk to the committee,
get this fixed.

1798
01:20:32,725 --> 01:20:35,461
There'll be no more bother.

1799
01:20:38,898 --> 01:20:43,203
I caught sight of my face
in that shop window

1800
01:20:43,236 --> 01:20:45,238
when I was running
down the street

1801
01:20:45,272 --> 01:20:47,773
and dragging them poor kids
behind me.

1802
01:20:47,807 --> 01:20:49,875
(inhales deeply)

1803
01:20:51,211 --> 01:20:54,046
And I was looking
in the mirror just now...

1804
01:20:55,915 --> 01:20:57,950
...at that same face.

1805
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:03,656
And I asked myself...

1806
01:21:05,658 --> 01:21:08,027
"What the hell am I doing?"

1807
01:21:12,265 --> 01:21:14,600
(shuddering inhale)

1808
01:21:15,901 --> 01:21:19,505
And then I was sick.

1809
01:21:21,341 --> 01:21:24,577
Like I am every morning now.

1810
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:35,521
And I realized...

1811
01:21:39,959 --> 01:21:42,329
...I don't think

1812
01:21:42,362 --> 01:21:44,930
it really matters anymore.

1813
01:21:46,599 --> 01:21:48,335
(Ma sniffles)

1814
01:21:48,368 --> 01:21:50,803
So, tomorrow...

1815
01:21:53,672 --> 01:21:56,876
...when Uncle Mack
and Auntie Violet come round...

1816
01:22:01,314 --> 01:22:03,883
...we're going to start
packing.

(inhales, shudders)

1818
01:22:19,332 --> 01:22:22,068
POP:
You have no choice.

1819
01:22:22,101 --> 01:22:25,938
You know they're gonna come
for you, don't you?

1820
01:22:25,971 --> 01:22:30,076
And this time,
they'll send somebody serious.

1821
01:22:31,911 --> 01:22:34,713
Get yourselves to the moon.

1822
01:22:37,716 --> 01:22:43,022
London's only
one small step for a man.

1823
01:22:43,055 --> 01:22:46,859
Belfast will still be here
when you get back.

1824
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:49,962
Will you?

1825
01:22:52,665 --> 01:22:55,734
I'm going nowhere
you won't find me.

1826
01:23:05,378 --> 01:23:08,714
(thunder rumbling)

1827
01:23:10,916 --> 01:23:12,751
MISS LEWIS:
And now to announce the winners

1828
01:23:12,785 --> 01:23:14,954
of our school moon project.

1829
01:23:14,987 --> 01:23:17,123
(kids cheering)

1830
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:20,759
Well, how'd it go with this?

1831
01:23:20,793 --> 01:23:22,262
BOTH:
We got a gold star.

1832
01:23:22,295 --> 01:23:23,929
Ah, good on youse.

1833
01:23:23,963 --> 01:23:27,434
Now, tell me this,
seeing as you two will know...

1834
01:23:27,467 --> 01:23:30,403
how do I get to the moon
with only ten pound,

1835
01:23:30,437 --> 01:23:33,240
three leaky umbrellas
and my bus pass?

1836
01:23:33,273 --> 01:23:35,342
(chuckles)

1837
01:23:35,375 --> 01:23:37,776
(retching)

1838
01:23:43,883 --> 01:23:47,052
See, there's an art
to an Ulster fry, son.

1839
01:23:47,086 --> 01:23:49,289
Mind you, I'm glad
your Aunt Violet's away

1840
01:23:49,322 --> 01:23:51,056
up the stairs there
with your ma.

1841
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:53,792

got the highest rates of
"chlomestremol" in the world.

1843
01:23:56,463 --> 01:23:58,331
Sure, I think it's great that

1844
01:23:58,365 --> 01:24:00,267
we're world champions
at something.

for me, son,

1847
01:24:02,968 --> 01:24:04,837

01:24:19,219 --> 01:24:21,120
BUDDY: Will you ask in there
for my daddy, please?

1853
01:24:21,154 --> 01:24:23,390
- Point out who he is.
- PA: The farmer says, "No,"

1854
01:24:23,423 --> 01:24:25,258
and he goes,
"Do you have any bread?"
