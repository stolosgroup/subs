2
00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:31,964
Nothing.

3
00:01:35,123 --> 00:01:36,490
Hit and run.

4
00:01:39,093 --> 00:01:41,297
Whoever it was, they're gone.

5
00:01:41,797 --> 00:01:44,058
War's over. He got the memo.

6
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:47,962
Ize?

7
00:01:50,656 --> 00:01:52,225
Allen?

8
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:54,577
Ize.

9
00:01:54,777 --> 00:01:56,285
What?

10
00:01:57,426 --> 00:02:01,051
We got no movement,
not a sign of a shadow. How...

11
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:05,145
How long we been here, man? 18-plus?

12
00:02:08,523 --> 00:02:10,818
- Twenty.
- Jesus.

13
00:02:13,662 --> 00:02:15,956
There's nobody fucking out there, man.

14
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:20,346
- 'Less he's a pro.
- A Hajji?

15
00:02:20,936 --> 00:02:22,997
I'm just saying, maybe.

16
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,702
Six construction guys on that pipeline.

17
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:33,515
Two-man security escort.

18
00:02:33,615 --> 00:02:35,184
Yeah.

19
00:02:35,624 --> 00:02:37,487
Look at 'em.

20
00:02:39,187 --> 00:02:40,222
What?

21
00:02:40,322 --> 00:02:43,326
Not one body near
to anything resembling cover.

22
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:47,382
- That's just fucking weird to me.
- Don't mean shit, man.

23
00:02:47,482 --> 00:02:50,291
Means he took them out pretty fucking fast.

24
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:03,512
And I think they're all
fucking head shots, too.

25
00:03:03,612 --> 00:03:08,176
Fuck off. Look, hey. Check out our boy
with the radio, he got the call out?

26
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:14,106
- Yeah.
- That ain't a head shot, Ize.

27
00:03:14,206 --> 00:03:18,285
Okay, fine, so one
without a fucking head shot.

28
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,196
I mean, eight guys, 30 seconds?

29
00:03:20,296 --> 00:03:22,598
So you're saying a Hajji
went in there with a semi-auto?

30
00:03:22,698 --> 00:03:24,932
Said he might be a pro.

31
00:03:25,032 --> 00:03:27,436
Right. We're dealing with Juba now?

32
00:03:28,336 --> 00:03:30,197
Might be.

33
00:03:31,106 --> 00:03:33,370
I'm just saying, that wall's cursed.

34
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,478
It's a wall, man.
You're scared of a fucking wall?

35
00:03:36,778 --> 00:03:39,061
Nah, I'm scared of what's behind it.

36
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:43,185
Could be two Hajjis sucking
each other off behind that thing.

37
00:03:43,685 --> 00:03:45,320
Hey.

38
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,290
What's there is there.

39
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,406
Rest of that shit's in your head,
you understand?

40
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:22,350
Ize?

41
00:04:24,626 --> 00:04:27,616
What's your vote now? Got anyone out there?

42
00:04:29,096 --> 00:04:30,632
No.

43
00:04:30,732 --> 00:04:33,160
I mean, I was 60% sure.

44
00:04:36,236 --> 00:04:38,407
Now I'm, like, 80.

45
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:41,068
I don't think so.

46
00:04:44,412 --> 00:04:47,082
Or... yep, he's a pro.

47
00:04:47,182 --> 00:04:49,822
Fuck off. Probably the same as it always is.

48
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,747
Four or five Hajjis came in
and bushwhacked 'em.

49
00:04:55,157 --> 00:04:57,226
Yeah, makes sense.

50
00:05:00,155 --> 00:05:01,688
Maybe.

51
00:05:11,523 --> 00:05:13,325
Or he's a pro.

52
00:05:13,675 --> 00:05:16,378
- I'm fucking hot. I'm calling it.
- See, fuck you, man.

53
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:18,714
I knew that's what you wanted to do.

54
00:05:18,814 --> 00:05:22,351
I'm fucking with you, man.
What, are you fucking hungry again?

55
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:24,753
Already had four or five MREs, gorilla fuck.

56
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:27,456
I'm not fucking sitting here dancing
around your super-theories...

57
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:30,025
...that a fucking super-sniper's
down there, bro.

58
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,996
No fucking way a Hajji
sticks around this long.

59
00:05:34,296 --> 00:05:36,098
You shitting me?

60
00:05:36,198 --> 00:05:40,135
I'm fucking hot as shit.
My balls have melted into one fucking ball.

61
00:05:40,235 --> 00:05:42,738
Later, you're on duty,
you're gonna pry these apart, all right?

62
00:05:42,838 --> 00:05:46,676
- Yeah, if I can fucking find it.
- And you're gonna fucking like it, too.

63
00:05:47,676 --> 00:05:49,211
I should've joined the fucking Air Force.

64
00:05:49,311 --> 00:05:53,207
You're too fucking big for the Air Force.
You'd bring the whole thing down.

65
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:56,986
Hey, I'm serious, man.

66
00:05:57,686 --> 00:06:00,825
- Get down.
- I'm serious, too. I'm going down there...

67
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:05,627
...grabbing that guy's radio, coming back
up here, and we are getting the fuck gone.

68
00:06:05,727 --> 00:06:08,029
Yeah, roger that.

69
00:06:13,271 --> 00:06:14,636
Comm check.

70
00:06:14,736 --> 00:06:17,765
Yup-yup. Check-check.

71
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:33,978
Where have you gone?

72
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:38,460
- Yep.
- <i>Movement?</i>

73
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,255
You look fucking rigid as shit.

74
00:06:44,298 --> 00:06:46,102
<i>How's that one ball?</i>

75
00:06:46,892 --> 00:06:49,338
Real nice. Real smart.

76
00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:51,932
<i>You'll always be number one to me, my man.</i>

77
00:06:57,611 --> 00:07:01,416
- You got eyes on that wall?
- I got eyes on your ass.

78
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,748
Shake that booty. Yeah, there it is.

79
00:07:08,556 --> 00:07:10,826
There we go. There it is.

80
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:12,895
I think your tampon just fell out.

81
00:07:12,995 --> 00:07:15,656
<i>Damn right. That'd usually cost you 25 bucks.</i>

82
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,732
<i>I'll make love to you</i>

83
00:07:18,832 --> 00:07:21,322
<i>Like you want me to </i>

84
00:07:32,347 --> 00:07:34,409
You're clear 360.

85
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:38,513
Keep them eyes open.

86
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:51,693
- Just watch my six.
- <i>Roger that.</i>

87
00:08:01,676 --> 00:08:03,938
Yeah, we're fucking solo out here.

88
00:08:07,582 --> 00:08:09,410
Lonely as fuck.

89
00:08:23,931 --> 00:08:25,067
Fuck.

90
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:28,003
<i>I'm getting closer here.
You got eyes on that wall?</i>

91
00:08:28,103 --> 00:08:29,964
Roger that.

92
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:34,950
- Shit.
- <i>What?</i>

93
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,607
This...

94
00:08:38,013 --> 00:08:40,378
Man, this fucking thing's fogging up, man.

95
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:46,747
<i>You have got to get rid of that shit.</i>

96
00:08:51,124 --> 00:08:52,994
It was Dean's.

97
00:08:53,094 --> 00:08:55,740
<i>Fuck Dean. Dean was a bitch.</i>

98
00:08:56,264 --> 00:08:59,707
Yeah, fuck Dean. Dean was a bitch.

99
00:09:00,402 --> 00:09:02,877
<i>Bad juju carrying around a dead man's scope.</i>

100
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,508
Something's not right.

101
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:50,352
What?

102
00:09:50,452 --> 00:09:53,489
Talk to me, man, talk to me.
What's going on down there?

103
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:57,151
<i>Ize, they are head shots, man.</i>

104
00:10:02,897 --> 00:10:04,959
<i>Can you tell where they came from?</i>

105
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:18,868
<i>You know what, fuck it.
Get the hell out of there, bro.</i>

106
00:10:19,815 --> 00:10:23,276
Hey, Ize, just check the...

107
00:10:26,688 --> 00:10:30,517
<i>Shit, I'm hit! Fuck, man, fuck!
I fucked up. Fuck!</i>

108
00:10:30,617 --> 00:10:32,118
Fuck!

109
00:10:33,094 --> 00:10:34,989
Fuck! Shit!

110
00:10:42,137 --> 00:10:45,650
Hang on, buddy. I'm coming down. Shit.

111
00:11:09,397 --> 00:11:10,873
They see me out there.

112
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:13,835
- They see me out there.
- Back up! Back up! Take cover!

113
00:11:13,935 --> 00:11:16,324
Take cover! What are you doing, man?

114
00:11:16,424 --> 00:11:19,774
Go! Get away from me, man! Go!

115
00:11:19,874 --> 00:11:22,168
Go! Go!

116
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:25,380
Back up!

117
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,611
Fucking shit!

118
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:34,372
Take cover!

119
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:38,919
Get down!

120
00:11:52,939 --> 00:11:55,201
Shit! Fuck!

121
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,443
Sar'nt! Sar'nt Matthews!

122
00:12:40,521 --> 00:12:42,821
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

123
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:44,459
Shit.

124
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,886
Fuck, I'm sorry!

125
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,291
Shit. Fuck.

126
00:12:52,434 --> 00:12:56,404
<i>No way. No fucking way. Shit. Okay.</i>

127
00:12:56,504 --> 00:12:59,474
<i>My brother, fucking tell RJ.
You got to tell him, okay?</i>

128
00:12:59,574 --> 00:13:04,323
- What about RJ?
- RJ. Tell fucking RJ that...

129
00:13:04,423 --> 00:13:08,126
I got... I got fucking...
I got fucking 22 grand, man. 22 grand.

130
00:13:08,226 --> 00:13:10,685
Stop, stop. Stop talking, bro.

131
00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:14,213
<i>I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to fucking do.</i>

132
00:13:17,758 --> 00:13:21,206
Tourniquet. Use your fucking tourniquet.

133
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:26,133
Fucking... tourniquet!

134
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:28,963
Use your fucking tourniquet!

Ize, I need your fucking help, man.

137
00:13:39,747 --> 00:13:42,050
I can't! You know that!

138
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:46,179
<i>No, no, no, no!

<i>You got it?</i>

141
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:08,560
Fuck.

- One second!

143
00:15:10,887 --> 00:15:12,732
Oh, God.

144
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:30,658
Breaker, breaker...

145
00:15:31,387 --> 00:15:32,919
Shit.

Break, break, break, Spartan Thirty Tree,
Requesting extraction.

Fuck.

What the fuck? Shit.

- Radio comm?
- He hit my fucking antenna!

156
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,741
<i>Hit the fucking antenna, man.</i>

Fuck.

You got eyes on him? I think I got a shot.

00:17:05,052 --> 00:17:08,323
<i>I'm going for it, man. You got eyes?</i>

00:17:11,992 --> 00:17:13,628
Fucking...

163
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:15,989
Sar'nt Matthews!

164
00:17:17,063 --> 00:17:18,733
Sar'nt!

165
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:22,603
No, no, no, no, no.
He'd shoot you before you even get...

166
00:17:24,238 --> 00:17:27,042
Sar'nt Matthews? You hear me?

167
00:17:28,342 --> 00:17:30,145
<i>I'm here.</i>

168
00:17:30,645 --> 00:17:33,707
Hang in there. Please fucking hang in there.

169
00:17:37,084 --> 00:17:38,946
<i>You got eyes on him?</i>

170
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:44,859
Come on, man, where'd he come from?

171
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:48,429
I don't fucking know. I don't know.

172
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:50,967
<i>Crack bang. What's the distance?</i>

173
00:17:52,467 --> 00:17:56,237
Crack bang. Crack bang.

174
00:17:56,337 --> 00:17:59,741
<i>Didn't you hear it?
Crack bang, how many seconds?</i>

175
00:18:00,941 --> 00:18:03,344
Give... give me a fucking...

176
00:18:03,844 --> 00:18:07,282
<i>Ize. You didn't fucking gauge?</i>

177
00:18:07,682 --> 00:18:09,704
<i>Listen, man, I got one shot at him.</i>

178
00:18:09,804 --> 00:18:12,420
Don't fucking touch that rifle, man.

179
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,487
Second you touch
that fucking rifle, you're dead.

180
00:18:16,957 --> 00:18:18,852
Hold on.

181
00:18:47,374 --> 00:18:48,915
Fuck!

182
00:20:25,652 --> 00:20:27,227
Fuck.

183
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,683
Fuck!

184
00:21:15,935 --> 00:21:19,632
All right. Shane, I got eyes on him.

185
00:21:23,243 --> 00:21:25,047
Sar'nt Matthews?

186
00:21:26,947 --> 00:21:29,409
Sar'nt Matthews, you fucking hear me?

187
00:21:32,218 --> 00:21:33,888
Shane!

188
00:21:34,949 --> 00:21:37,768
Oh, man. Come...

189
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:40,329
You didn't bleed out. Come on, man, get up.

190
00:21:42,329 --> 00:21:44,791
Get up and dress that wound, man.

191
00:22:17,297 --> 00:22:19,759
Fuck. Fuck.

192
00:22:56,736 --> 00:22:58,798
You motherfucker.

193
00:23:00,807 --> 00:23:02,810
Fu... fucking...

194
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,406
Fuck. Fuck.

195
00:23:10,985 --> 00:23:12,446
Okay.

196
00:23:53,593 --> 00:23:54,975
<i>Last transmission.</i>

197
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,733
<i>Come in.</i>

198
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:00,994
<i>How do you copy?</i>

199
00:24:03,803 --> 00:24:05,673
<i>Come in.</i>

200
00:24:06,473 --> 00:24:08,334
<i>Last transmission.</i>

201
00:24:14,013 --> 00:24:15,850
<i>Come in.</i>

202
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,486
<i>How do you copy?</i>

203
00:24:19,286 --> 00:24:21,347
<i>How do you read us?</i>

204
00:24:26,992 --> 00:24:28,822
<i>Last transmission.</i>

205
00:24:31,531 --> 00:24:33,793
<i>How do you copy?</i>

206
00:24:35,268 --> 00:24:36,904
<i>How do you copy?</i>

207
00:24:37,004 --> 00:24:39,607
This is Spartan Thirty Tree. How copy?

208
00:24:39,707 --> 00:24:42,380
<i>Reading you, Lima Charlie, over.</i>

209
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,270
This is Spartan Thirty Tree.

210
00:24:46,747 --> 00:24:52,479
Receiving enemy fire. Requesting dust-off.
I got a man down. There's a shooter.

211
00:24:52,579 --> 00:24:56,190
Got us pinned. Me, got me pinned.
Requesting medevac.

212
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:59,385
I repeat, I repeat, requesting medevac.

213
00:25:00,927 --> 00:25:03,197
<i>What's your position, over?</i>

214
00:25:05,197 --> 00:25:07,934
Grid Whiskey Hotel 7203.

215
00:25:08,034 --> 00:25:10,670
<i>Copy that. Stand by.</i>

216
00:25:18,511 --> 00:25:20,114
Oh, God.

217
00:25:20,214 --> 00:25:22,083
Hey, Shane.

218
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:24,944
We're going home, buddy.

219
00:25:39,534 --> 00:25:41,428
About fucking time.

220
00:25:57,316 --> 00:25:59,153
All right, come on.

221
00:25:59,553 --> 00:26:02,790
This is Spartan Tree Tree.
Are you there, over?

222
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,560
- Okay.
- <i>Reading you, Lima Charlie.</i>

223
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,027
<i>You're on a radio feed, and we do not
want to move beyond range of your signal.</i>

224
00:26:10,127 --> 00:26:12,133
- <i>Do you copy?</i>
- Beyond range of my signal?

225
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:14,468
You're already in my local radio.

226
00:26:14,868 --> 00:26:16,691
Are you close?

227
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:19,399
<i>Need a confirm on your ID, over.</i>

228
00:26:22,074 --> 00:26:25,312
This is Sar'nt Allen Isaac, 51st ODA.

229
00:26:25,412 --> 00:26:29,049
I have staff Sar'nt
Shane Matthews here with me.

230
00:26:30,349 --> 00:26:33,354
But he's down. Possibly KIA.

231
00:26:33,854 --> 00:26:36,724
I don't know. He's not responding, so...

232
00:26:37,604 --> 00:26:39,204
...over.

233
00:26:41,078 --> 00:26:44,741
<i>We copy, Spartan Tree Tree. Prepping medevac.</i>

234
00:26:49,887 --> 00:26:51,697
Jesus Christ.

235
00:26:54,908 --> 00:26:57,537
All right, you little fucker, you.

236
00:27:05,585 --> 00:27:08,088
Fucking NATO round.

237
00:27:08,188 --> 00:27:10,057
Goddamn.

238
00:27:10,357 --> 00:27:14,261
7.62x51.

239
00:27:14,461 --> 00:27:18,632
No, we got a shooter.
High-caliber weapon. Requesting UAV.

240
00:27:18,732 --> 00:27:22,269
<i>We need your challenge code
before we send in medevac.</i>

241
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:25,439
- What? Say that again.
- <i>Send your challenge code.</i>

242
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:28,368
What the fuck is... no. But...

243
00:27:33,847 --> 00:27:37,351
- Who is this?
- <i>This is Captain Otis Simmons.</i>

244
00:27:37,451 --> 00:27:42,256
<i>I need your challenge code if I'm gonna
get you and your staff Sar'nt medevac.</i>

245
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:46,460
Romeo, no... no, wait,
I didn't say I needed medical assistance.

246
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,565
- Do you copy?
- <i>Copy that. I assumed.</i>

247
00:27:51,565 --> 00:27:53,659
<i>But this is protocol.</i>

248
00:27:57,236 --> 00:27:59,851
Well, fuck me. How do I know that?

249
00:27:59,951 --> 00:28:02,209
That you are who you say you are?

250
00:28:02,609 --> 00:28:05,646
<i>Allen Isaac. You and your
staff Sergeant Shane Matthews...</i>

251
00:28:05,746 --> 00:28:09,450
<i>...made an overnight worm into a kill zone
to investigate a potential sniper...</i>

252
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,852
<i>...and report back to us.</i>

253
00:28:11,952 --> 00:28:14,034
Okay, okay.

254
00:28:14,134 --> 00:28:17,169
All right, I'm sorry. I'm a little fucked up.

255
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:20,920
Listen, you got to bring a heavy escort.
This guy's a fucking asshole.

256
00:28:30,436 --> 00:28:32,532
Where do you keep going?

257
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:37,937
<i>Do you have a flare, Sergeant?</i>

258
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:44,029
<i>Do you copy?</i>

259
00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:47,788
Yeah. No, I don't.
I have an M4 and a sidearm.

260
00:28:47,888 --> 00:28:50,524
<i>I need you to stand and fire into the air.</i>

261
00:28:50,624 --> 00:28:54,489
- <i>We need to get a lock on your position.</i>
- What the fuck?

262
00:28:54,589 --> 00:28:58,632
This ain't ranger school. The fucking shooter
will get a fucking lock on my position.

263
00:28:58,732 --> 00:29:02,772
<i>Well, I can't help you unless I know
your location. Do you copy?</i>

264
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:07,774
Fuck.

265
00:29:07,874 --> 00:29:11,411
A lot of fucking help you've been
so fucking far, motherfucker.

266
00:29:21,954 --> 00:29:24,325
This is fucking stupid.
This ain't fucking protocol.

267
00:29:24,425 --> 00:29:27,761
<i>Sergeant, we need your exact location
to send in medevac.</i>

268
00:29:27,861 --> 00:29:29,663
Say that again.

269
00:29:30,363 --> 00:29:34,601
- <i>I need your location.</i>
- No, my rank. What's my rank?

270
00:29:34,901 --> 00:29:36,462
<i>Sergeant.</i>

271
00:29:38,538 --> 00:29:40,107
You...

272
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:42,409
...you got an accent.

273
00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:44,638
Not American.

274
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:49,516
<i>You have seen through my camouflage.</i>

275
00:29:50,316 --> 00:29:52,187
Fuck you talking about?

276
00:29:53,587 --> 00:29:56,682
<i>I'm talking about hiding behind words.</i>

277
00:29:58,057 --> 00:30:00,506
<i>Like you are hiding behind that wall.</i>

278
00:30:02,129 --> 00:30:04,590
You... you're...

279
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:08,195
Motherf...

280
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,254
Shit.

281
00:30:17,444 --> 00:30:19,705
You fuck!

282
00:30:22,515 --> 00:30:24,585
<i>I've got a question for you.</i>

283
00:30:25,585 --> 00:30:28,280
<i>Your friend... is he dead?</i>

284
00:30:29,023 --> 00:30:33,093
- <i>He... he looks dead to me.</i>
- This is Spartan 33 sending in the blind.

285
00:30:33,193 --> 00:30:35,195
<i>But maybe he's just unconscious.</i>

286
00:30:35,295 --> 00:30:37,431
I got a man down!

287
00:30:37,531 --> 00:30:40,334
- <i>Shall I make sure?</i>
- I got a sniper.

288
00:30:40,434 --> 00:30:44,405
- I got an enemy sniper. Requesting medevac!
- <i>Shall I shoot him in the head?</i>

289
00:30:44,505 --> 00:30:49,169
- I repeat. I repeat. Requesting...
- <i>Does he have a wife? Children?</i>

290
00:30:54,914 --> 00:30:58,953
<i>Will they enjoy a closed casket
if I take his face off?</i>

291
00:31:00,053 --> 00:31:02,656
All right, all right, shut the fuck up, man.

292
00:31:02,756 --> 00:31:05,448
All right, stop, stop, stop, stop.

293
00:31:14,533 --> 00:31:16,436
Is there something that you want?

294
00:31:16,536 --> 00:31:19,373
- <i>Yes.</i>
- I don't know nothing.

295
00:31:19,473 --> 00:31:23,377
I'm a buck Sar'nt.
They don't tell me shit. So fuck you.

296
00:31:23,477 --> 00:31:27,342
- <i>That's not what I want.</i>
- Oh, what do you want?

297
00:31:27,447 --> 00:31:30,143
You want fucking 12 virgins or something?

298
00:31:32,685 --> 00:31:34,721
<i>I want to get to know you.</i>

299
00:31:35,021 --> 00:31:37,524
<i>I just want to get to know you.</i>

300
00:31:37,624 --> 00:31:39,485
<i>Will you allow that?</i>

301
00:31:42,928 --> 00:31:44,790
You're fucking with me.

302
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:49,771
<i>I was, but you figured it out.</i>

303
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,773
<i>So now let's be real.</i>

304
00:31:52,873 --> 00:31:55,309
<i>It's just you and me out here.</i>

305
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:58,103
So, what do you say?

306
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:04,118
- Yeah, I'll talk to you.
- <i>Good. Where are you from?</i>

307
00:32:04,218 --> 00:32:08,514
No. Listen, I don't know shit
about you, so why don't you go first?

308
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:16,369
<i>Me? There is nothing to say. No story.</i>

309
00:32:18,031 --> 00:32:20,494
You're the one who wants to get chatty, bro.

310
00:32:37,283 --> 00:32:39,298
Why ain't you saying anything?

311
00:32:49,261 --> 00:32:52,091
<i>Okay. I'll start.</i>

312
00:32:55,401 --> 00:32:59,674
<i>I am just a regular Iraqi man.</i>

313
00:33:07,746 --> 00:33:09,584
<i>A civilian.</i>

314
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:11,594
A civilian, my ass.

315
00:33:15,321 --> 00:33:17,725
Crack bang.

316
00:33:18,225 --> 00:33:21,094
One, two, three, four, five.

317
00:33:22,694 --> 00:33:25,378
One, two, three, four, five.

318
00:33:25,478 --> 00:33:27,734
One, two, three, four, bang.

319
00:33:28,334 --> 00:33:30,137
Four plus four.

320
00:33:30,937 --> 00:33:35,031
Four plus four, 800. Plus...

321
00:33:44,216 --> 00:33:45,763
Okay.

322
00:33:48,654 --> 00:33:50,224
Bullet.

323
00:33:50,724 --> 00:33:53,126
45, 50, 60.

324
00:33:53,226 --> 00:33:55,282
60-degree angle.

325
00:33:56,963 --> 00:34:00,326
Nine, 950... 950 plus...

326
00:34:06,238 --> 00:34:08,069
That gives me...

327
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:10,970
...1,500.

328
00:34:20,586 --> 00:34:23,849
Okay. Okay.

329
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:28,893
Got the wall, me, Matthews.

330
00:34:39,939 --> 00:34:43,276
Crane, construction site...

331
00:34:43,376 --> 00:34:45,712
...trailers, flagpole.

332
00:34:46,012 --> 00:34:47,881
<i>And you?</i>

333
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:50,409
What about me?

334
00:34:51,317 --> 00:34:53,721
<i>Are you a regular American?</i>

335
00:34:55,621 --> 00:34:57,643
Yeah, a regular joe.

336
00:34:59,092 --> 00:35:01,587
<i>A regular G.I. Joe.</i>

337
00:35:06,165 --> 00:35:08,427
<i>Army ranger or Marine?</i>

338
00:35:11,136 --> 00:35:13,139
You worked in our fucking ranks?

339
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:16,776
Had our training,
and then you fucking backstab us.

340
00:35:16,876 --> 00:35:20,814
Look, these fucking guys
were building pipelines.

341
00:35:20,914 --> 00:35:24,209
Building up your fucking
economy, you asshole.

342
00:35:26,953 --> 00:35:28,556
<i>Pipelines?</i>

343
00:35:29,856 --> 00:35:31,859
<i>For our economy?</i>

344
00:35:32,659 --> 00:35:34,594
Yeah, that's fucking money.

345
00:35:34,694 --> 00:35:37,732
Infrastructure, education, schools.

346
00:35:38,332 --> 00:35:40,467
These guys were fucking contractors.

347
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:42,402
Not here to fight.

348
00:35:42,502 --> 00:35:44,304
War's over, bro.

349
00:35:44,904 --> 00:35:46,440
<i>Bro?</i>

350
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,942
Whatever, man.

351
00:35:49,042 --> 00:35:51,312
<i>It's an interesting choice of words.</i>

352
00:35:52,012 --> 00:35:54,981
<i>And yet I disagree with you, bro.</i>

353
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:56,942
<i>The war's not over.</i>

354
00:35:59,151 --> 00:36:01,413
<i>Definitely not for you.</i>

355
00:36:06,391 --> 00:36:09,630
You say... you say a lot of fucking
fancy words. What are you, Ha...

356
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:12,170
...Hajji Shakespeare or some shit?

357
00:36:13,399 --> 00:36:15,069
<i>Shakespeare?</i>

358
00:36:15,419 --> 00:36:17,688
<i>Military lingo is all poetry.</i>

359
00:36:17,788 --> 00:36:20,190
<i>Battle rattle, ghetto grip.</i>

360
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:23,853
<i>Johnny Jihad, friendly fire.</i>

361
00:36:38,823 --> 00:36:40,660
<i>Your turn, Isaac.</i>

362
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,812
<i>Or should I say "Ize"?</i>

363
00:36:47,066 --> 00:36:50,804
What? What do you mean it's my turn?
What you want me to say?

364
00:36:50,904 --> 00:36:54,608
<i>Tell me where you're from.
Where's your family?</i>

365
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:56,743
I'm not talking about fucking family.

366
00:36:57,677 --> 00:36:59,272
God.

367
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:08,515
<i>Okay, then tell me about
your brothers and sisters at arms.</i>

368
00:37:09,272 --> 00:37:11,141
That's a negative, too, bro.

369
00:37:11,241 --> 00:37:14,444
<i>I don't want any military secrets,
just stories.</i>

370
00:37:14,544 --> 00:37:18,132
- Eat a dick.
- <i>I will shoot Matthews if you don't talk.</i>

371
00:37:18,232 --> 00:37:20,100
Go ahead.

372
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,981
<i>Yes?</i>

373
00:37:25,337 --> 00:37:27,374
<i>He is your second loss.</i>

374
00:37:27,974 --> 00:37:31,011
<i>First Dean, now Matthews.</i>

375
00:37:31,511 --> 00:37:33,413
How the fuck do you know about Dean?

376
00:37:33,513 --> 00:37:36,341
- <i>Keep talking.</i>
- No, fuck you. How?

377
00:37:38,134 --> 00:37:40,370
<i>You carry his scope around.</i>

378
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,372
<i>What was it your sergeant said?</i>

379
00:37:42,472 --> 00:37:44,533
<i>"A dead man's scope"?</i>

380
00:37:51,162 --> 00:37:52,758
You...

381
00:37:57,136 --> 00:37:59,373
<i>Just tell me something, Isaac.</i>

382
00:37:59,773 --> 00:38:01,702
<i>Tell me about your comrades.</i>

383
00:38:01,842 --> 00:38:04,220
<i>Or I will shoot Matthews' face off.</i>

384
00:38:07,714 --> 00:38:09,241
Okay.

385
00:38:17,964 --> 00:38:21,412
Yeah. We... we play ball.

386
00:38:21,762 --> 00:38:23,597
<i>I beg your pardon?</i>

387
00:38:25,547 --> 00:38:29,769
Yeah, no, me... me and the squad,
we... we play in the afternoon.

388
00:38:30,946 --> 00:38:33,206
Get baked in the Iraqi sun.

389
00:38:34,483 --> 00:38:37,677
Nothing else to do. No war to fight.

390
00:38:37,777 --> 00:38:39,279
<i>"Baked"?</i>

391
00:38:39,779 --> 00:38:41,673
<i>What does that mean?</i>

392
00:38:44,066 --> 00:38:46,695
Baked, like, you know, tanned.

393
00:38:55,193 --> 00:38:57,063
<i>Go on.</i>

394
00:38:57,463 --> 00:38:59,325
Go on?

395
00:39:00,999 --> 00:39:03,203
<i>What about Sergeant Matthews?</i>

396
00:39:03,303 --> 00:39:05,197
<i>Did he get baked?</i>

397
00:39:08,175 --> 00:39:09,864
<i>Did Dean?</i>

398
00:39:11,644 --> 00:39:15,282
I ain't talking about fucking Dean
with you, you dirty fucking Hajji.

399
00:39:16,382 --> 00:39:19,468
<i>If I were you, I would start talking, Isaac.</i>

400
00:39:19,986 --> 00:39:21,841
<i>Tell me about Dean.</i>

401
00:39:23,355 --> 00:39:25,191
What's the obsession?

402
00:39:25,591 --> 00:39:29,228
- What the fuck?
- <i>It's interesting to me...</i>

403
00:39:29,328 --> 00:39:32,158
<i>...the bond between you and your brothers.</i>

404
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,335
<i>And I will shoot Matthews
if you do not speak.</i>

405
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,692
I'm looking at him right now.
It would be so easy to tear his face off.

406
00:39:47,146 --> 00:39:49,549
<i>His family won't even recognize him.</i>

407
00:39:50,002 --> 00:39:52,077
<i>Is that what you want, Ize?</i>

408
00:40:01,894 --> 00:40:04,350
<i>You should just answer my questions.</i>

409
00:40:06,566 --> 00:40:08,994
All right, all right.

410
00:40:24,616 --> 00:40:26,845
<i>So, tell me about Dean's scope.</i>

411
00:40:29,662 --> 00:40:31,558
Oh, fuck.

412
00:40:31,658 --> 00:40:34,361
<i>I can see it at the base of the wall there.</i>

413
00:40:34,461 --> 00:40:36,329
<i>Why do you keep it?</i>

414
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:38,047
Fuck.

415
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:52,905
<i>You said it's broken. Why would you
carry around a broken scope, Isaac?</i>

416
00:40:54,978 --> 00:40:57,851
Shut the fuck up, man. How's this end?

417
00:40:58,051 --> 00:40:59,920
How the fuck's this end?

418
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,981
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

419
00:41:04,773 --> 00:41:08,457
I said, how the fuck's it end?
What's the fucking endgame?

420
00:41:09,478 --> 00:41:13,099
<i>There's no endgame.
I'm just enjoying our conversation.</i>

421
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:17,237
Stop. Fucking stop, all right?
You're not gonna get to fucking know me.

422
00:41:17,737 --> 00:41:19,673
<i>But I feel like I know you better already.</i>

423
00:41:19,773 --> 00:41:23,609
No, you fucking don't! You don't know shit.

424
00:41:23,709 --> 00:41:27,714
You're dehydrated, I know that.
That's why I aimed at your water bottle.

425
00:41:27,814 --> 00:41:30,250
No, you didn't.
You fucking was trying to hit me.

426
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:32,411
<i>No. The water bottle.</i>

427
00:41:34,253 --> 00:41:36,256
Nobody's that fucking accurate.

428
00:41:36,756 --> 00:41:38,562
<i>And your antenna.</i>

429
00:41:39,759 --> 00:41:41,928
No fucking way.

430
00:41:42,028 --> 00:41:43,460
<i>And your knee.</i>

431
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:46,597
<i>I know the popliteal vein in your leg...</i>

432
00:41:46,697 --> 00:41:49,895
<i>...carries enough blood that, no matter
what kind of bandaging you have...</i>

433
00:41:49,995 --> 00:41:53,039
<i>...you will still be sitting
in a puddle of plasma.</i>

434
00:41:53,539 --> 00:41:56,776
<i>You're feeling fatigued, lightheaded.</i>

435
00:41:56,876 --> 00:41:59,914
<i>And you will bleed out before nightfall.</i>

436
00:42:00,814 --> 00:42:03,632
What the fuck is going on with this shit?

437
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:06,461
You fucker.

438
00:42:08,054 --> 00:42:10,256
You psychotic motherfucker.

439
00:42:10,656 --> 00:42:12,884
What do you want from me?

440
00:42:14,888 --> 00:42:16,455
Fuck!

441
00:42:29,876 --> 00:42:31,478
Fucking...

442
00:42:31,578 --> 00:42:34,206
Fucking... Hajji.

443
00:42:48,426 --> 00:42:51,048
Hey, where do you keep fucking going?

444
00:42:52,631 --> 00:42:56,061
No, no, you're trying to fucking
circle my wall, ain't you?

445
00:42:58,137 --> 00:43:00,974
Trying to circle around my wall,
motherfucker?

446
00:43:01,574 --> 00:43:03,176
<i>That's ironic.</i>

447
00:43:03,276 --> 00:43:05,480
Yeah, I'm right?

448
00:43:07,279 --> 00:43:09,683
<i>You say "my wall."</i>

449
00:43:10,383 --> 00:43:13,595
<i>The very wall your country
came here to knock down...</i>

450
00:43:13,953 --> 00:43:16,790
<i>...you now try desperately
to keep from falling.</i>

451
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,593
You find that fucking funny?

452
00:43:20,693 --> 00:43:24,364
<i>You should know,
that wall you're hiding behind...</i>

453
00:43:24,464 --> 00:43:26,759
<i>...was actually part of a school.</i>

454
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:32,071
Yeah, well, I'll piss on it.
That's what I think about your fucking wall.

455
00:43:32,171 --> 00:43:34,541
<i>You're hiding in the shadow of Islam.</i>

456
00:43:34,641 --> 00:43:37,811
No, I'm hiding in the shadow
of fucking death.

457
00:43:37,911 --> 00:43:40,973
I'm in the fucking shadow of death.

458
00:43:55,994 --> 00:43:59,667
Nice try. That's got to be a 20 mag.

459
00:44:07,105 --> 00:44:08,909
So all the guys...

460
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:12,671
It's got to be 20 mag.

461
00:44:30,229 --> 00:44:32,265
One in Matthews...

462
00:44:32,965 --> 00:44:35,027
...three in me.

463
00:44:45,542 --> 00:44:47,414
That 76...

464
00:44:47,714 --> 00:44:51,777
...that 7.62x51 NATO round is U.S. issued?

465
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,222
Hey, motherfucker.

466
00:44:56,422 --> 00:44:59,559
You want to talk? Come on, man. What's up?

467
00:44:59,659 --> 00:45:01,561
<i>You want to know the weapon I'm using.</i>

468
00:45:01,661 --> 00:45:05,132
M24? Mark 11?

469
00:45:05,232 --> 00:45:08,668
<i>I would prefer an M96 Windrunner any day.</i>

470
00:45:09,268 --> 00:45:11,470
I thought we were being honest.

471
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:13,773
I know you're using a Mark 11.

472
00:45:13,873 --> 00:45:17,110
<i>No, you believe that's what I'm using.</i>

473
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:19,913
<i>But you don't know anything for certain.</i>

474
00:45:20,013 --> 00:45:21,881
<i>You don't know shit.</i>

475
00:45:22,448 --> 00:45:25,285
<i>Is that how you say it?</i>
<i>"You don't know shit"?</i>

476
00:45:25,385 --> 00:45:27,187
Say that again.

477
00:45:27,987 --> 00:45:29,881
I can't hear you.

478
00:45:31,257 --> 00:45:32,759
<i>Okay.</i>

479
00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:34,494
<i>You...</i>

480
00:45:34,594 --> 00:45:36,029
<i>...don't...</i>

481
00:45:36,129 --> 00:45:38,556
<i>...know... shit.</i>

482
00:45:45,069 --> 00:45:47,440
I don't know shit?

483
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,409
Well, go on, please.

484
00:45:49,509 --> 00:45:51,370
Educate me, man.

485
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:55,341
Come on, I'm listening.

486
00:45:59,352 --> 00:46:01,421
<i>You Americans...</i>

487
00:46:01,921 --> 00:46:03,924
<i>...you think you know it all.</i>

488
00:46:05,024 --> 00:46:06,860
<i>You think it's simple.</i>

489
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,029
<i>That I am your enemy.</i>

490
00:46:09,629 --> 00:46:12,432
<i>But we are not so different, you and I.</i>

491
00:46:13,032 --> 00:46:15,435
Yeah, except I ain't a fucking terrorist.

492
00:46:16,885 --> 00:46:18,847
<i>And you think I am?</i>

493
00:46:22,641 --> 00:46:26,319
<i>You are the one who has come
to another man's country.</i>

494
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,719
<i>Camouflaged yourself in his land...</i>

495
00:46:32,619 --> 00:46:34,467
<i>...in his soil.</i>

496
00:46:37,689 --> 00:46:39,691
No fucking way.

497
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,930
<i>From where I'm sitting...</i>

498
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:47,301
<i>...you look very much like the terrorist.</i>

499
00:46:53,521 --> 00:46:56,166
You're in the fucking trash?

500
00:46:57,776 --> 00:46:59,472
No fucking way.

501
00:47:02,642 --> 00:47:04,722
Unless he's a pro.

502
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,624
You're him.

503
00:47:11,574 --> 00:47:13,409
You're Juba.

504
00:47:13,959 --> 00:47:15,829
The ghost.

505
00:47:17,029 --> 00:47:19,798
<i>A hundred men out there call themselves Juba.</i>

506
00:47:19,898 --> 00:47:21,747
<i>I'm just a man.</i>

507
00:47:24,036 --> 00:47:26,546
35 U.S. casualties...

508
00:47:26,646 --> 00:47:28,492
...angel of death.

509
00:47:30,009 --> 00:47:32,213
That's why they never find you.

510
00:47:35,141 --> 00:47:36,683
Damn.

511
00:47:37,483 --> 00:47:40,971
You must've been days
in that fucking shit heap.

512
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:49,362
So, we trained you, obviously.

513
00:47:50,162 --> 00:47:55,404
Learn how to shoot, trajectory, zeroing
the rifle, no reloads between shots.

514
00:47:56,502 --> 00:47:59,138
Learned all that shit and then betrayed us?

515
00:47:59,238 --> 00:48:01,875
<i>Depends on the angle you look at it from.</i>

516
00:48:01,975 --> 00:48:03,843
Only one angle.

517
00:48:04,643 --> 00:48:07,100
<i>Yes, as I'd expect you to say.</i>

518
00:48:08,381 --> 00:48:13,254
No. Tell me you're my enemy...
fine, I'll respect that.

519
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:15,721
We kill, we kill.

520
00:48:15,821 --> 00:48:17,740
But say you're my friend...

521
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:22,028
...and shoot me in the back,
the only angle I see is a fucking snake.

522
00:48:22,128 --> 00:48:26,232
<i>But if this friend shoots you
in the back and you survive...</i>

523
00:48:26,332 --> 00:48:28,594
<i>...is it okay to shoot him back?</i>

524
00:48:34,472 --> 00:48:36,743
<i>I want you to tell me something, Isaac.</i>

525
00:48:38,043 --> 00:48:39,880
<i>Why are you here?</i>

526
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,309
<i>Why are you still here, Isaac?</i>

527
00:48:46,418 --> 00:48:48,784
<i>How many tours have you done now?</i>

528
00:48:51,156 --> 00:48:53,385
<i>Why do you keep coming back?</i>

529
00:49:03,469 --> 00:49:06,740
- <i>Is it because of Dean?</i>
- You've got to...

530
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,802
How the fuck did I get here?

531
00:49:12,331 --> 00:49:16,082
<i>Is that why? Be honest with me, Isaac.</i>

532
00:49:16,182 --> 00:49:18,076
<i>Is it because of Dean?</i>

533
00:49:22,253 --> 00:49:24,124
Just tell me...

534
00:49:24,924 --> 00:49:26,393
...how...

535
00:49:26,493 --> 00:49:28,187
...did you know...

536
00:49:28,287 --> 00:49:30,369
...how'd you know that name?

537
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:34,145
<i>Tell me one thing about him.</i>

538
00:49:35,017 --> 00:49:36,878
<i>Just one thing.</i>

539
00:49:44,776 --> 00:49:47,413
We were from around about the same area.

540
00:49:48,213 --> 00:49:50,049
His cousins...

541
00:49:50,449 --> 00:49:52,662
...went to the same school as me.

542
00:49:53,786 --> 00:49:55,840
My dad knows his...

543
00:49:56,951 --> 00:49:58,826
...seen his kid.

544
00:50:00,992 --> 00:50:02,829
Held him.

545
00:50:03,429 --> 00:50:05,691
More than Dean's ever done.

546
00:50:09,567 --> 00:50:12,438
Clem works by the fucking stop n' shop.

547
00:50:13,627 --> 00:50:15,208
<i>Clem?</i>

548
00:50:15,808 --> 00:50:17,869
Clementine, his wife.

549
00:50:21,913 --> 00:50:25,151
No fucking way. I can't...
I can't go back to that.

550
00:50:25,251 --> 00:50:27,687
Fucking day in, day out shit.

551
00:50:28,787 --> 00:50:30,648
And them looking at me.

552
00:50:33,191 --> 00:50:34,994
And they would. They...

553
00:50:35,594 --> 00:50:38,031
...they'd look at me and they'd...

554
00:50:39,431 --> 00:50:41,493
...they'd see me.

555
00:50:43,234 --> 00:50:44,815
Fuck.

556
00:50:46,672 --> 00:50:48,174
Nope.

557
00:50:48,474 --> 00:50:51,887
I can't go... I can't... I can't do that.

558
00:50:51,987 --> 00:50:53,869
I can't go back.

559
00:50:58,451 --> 00:51:00,334
Oh, my God.

560
00:51:03,022 --> 00:51:04,536
Fuck.

561
00:51:17,169 --> 00:51:18,972
You happy now?

562
00:51:19,472 --> 00:51:21,507
Now you know everything.

563
00:51:21,907 --> 00:51:24,377
You're fucked up, you know that?

564
00:51:24,677 --> 00:51:25,945
<i>Why is that?</i>

565
00:51:26,045 --> 00:51:28,877
'Cause you got to mess
with my fucking head, too.

566
00:51:39,991 --> 00:51:42,828
<i>Isaac, when this is over...</i>

567
00:51:42,928 --> 00:51:46,158
<i>...the skin will be cut from your face.</i>

568
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,670
<i>Your eyes will be gouged.</i>

569
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:54,540
Fucking shoot me, you prick.

570
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,242
<i>Your lying tongue
will be stapled to your chest.</i>

571
00:52:02,147 --> 00:52:05,401
Just fucking shoot me, man. Get it over with.

572
00:52:06,051 --> 00:52:08,221
<i>But I will let them find your body.</i>

573
00:52:08,321 --> 00:52:10,783
Fuck it, I might just shoot myself.

574
00:53:08,363 --> 00:53:12,026
All right, you asshole, where are you?

575
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,229
Okay.

576
00:53:46,268 --> 00:53:48,729
All right, you stupid motherfucker.

577
00:53:49,172 --> 00:53:52,100
Bite on this, you fucking Hajji bitch.

578
00:53:58,863 --> 00:54:02,667
Come on, show me something. Send it, bitch.

579
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:49,774
Fuck.

580
00:57:02,313 --> 00:57:03,874
Fuck.

581
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:31,707
Shit.

582
00:57:32,725 --> 00:57:34,238
Fuck!

583
00:58:52,757 --> 00:58:54,960
<i>That was foolish, Isaac.</i>

584
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:58,489
<i>I could've shot you.
I could've easily shot you.</i>

585
00:59:03,434 --> 00:59:04,938
<i>Ize.</i>

586
00:59:07,405 --> 00:59:10,434
<i>I just want to have
a conversation with you, Isaac.</i>

587
00:59:15,813 --> 00:59:18,367
<i>Why are you trying to get yourself killed?</i>

588
00:59:41,539 --> 00:59:43,601
<i>Isaac, are you there?</i>

589
00:59:53,587 --> 00:59:55,110
Fuck.

590
01:00:02,895 --> 01:00:04,348
<i>Isaac.</i>

591
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:09,545
<i>Isaac... the radio you risked
your life for, it's dead.</i>

592
01:00:13,505 --> 01:00:15,341
<i>Are you dead, too?</i>

593
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:18,310
You missed. I'm still here.

594
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:20,545
You're not that fucking good.

595
01:00:20,645 --> 01:00:24,316
<i>He speaks! Tear up the planks. Hear, hear.</i>

596
01:00:24,416 --> 01:00:27,019
<i>It is the beating of his hideous heart.</i>

597
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:30,055
What's that, one of your gay-ass Hajji poems?

598
01:00:30,155 --> 01:00:33,160
<i>American. "Tell Tale Heart."</i>

599
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,995
<i>Edgar Allan Poe.</i>

600
01:00:37,095 --> 01:00:39,931
I didn't catch a fucking word
you're saying, man.

601
01:00:40,031 --> 01:00:42,301
<i>Edgar Allan Poe. Don't you...</i>

602
01:00:43,301 --> 01:00:45,871
What's wrong with your fucking
radio, man? What is that?

603
01:00:45,971 --> 01:00:47,973
<i>You must've studied his work.</i>

604
01:00:48,273 --> 01:00:50,342
<i>He's an American great.</i>

605
01:00:50,842 --> 01:00:52,878
<i>...writing is really...</i>

606
01:00:53,278 --> 01:00:56,348
What is it? Not doing a fucking thing.

607
01:00:56,448 --> 01:00:59,109
<i>Did you know that he was an orphan?</i>

608
01:01:00,218 --> 01:01:03,247
<i>He tried to be a soldier,
but didn't get very...</i>

609
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,392
Shane.

610
01:01:10,492 --> 01:01:13,939
- Shane, is that you?
- <i>He was a better writer than a soldier.</i>

611

<i>Quoth the raven, 'nevermore.'"</i>

621
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:02,440
<i>Or perhaps you would prefer Robert Frost?</i>

<i>"A voice said...</i>

Shit.

631
01:02:48,827 --> 01:02:51,814
So, you studied?

632
01:02:53,864 --> 01:02:55,368
Studied...

633
01:02:55,868 --> 01:02:58,405
...you studied here or abroad?

634
01:03:00,105 --> 01:03:02,441
<i>Like, I know they got those...</i>

636

Shane!

637
01:03:10,012 --> 01:03:12,551
A shot from that distance,
he's got to be at least...

638
01:03:12,651 --> 01:03:15,455
...25, 30 feet up, man.

639
01:03:16,755 --> 01:03:20,035
We're talking 1,500 meters. 1,550 maybe.

640
01:03:21,401 --> 01:03:22,995
Right?

641
01:03:23,495 --> 01:03:26,758
Why ain't you talking, man?
Come on, you there?

642
01:03:28,232 --> 01:03:29,802
Fuck.

643
01:03:30,202 --> 01:03:31,763
Fuck.

644
01:03:35,106 --> 01:03:37,000
Are you there, man?

645
01:03:40,444 --> 01:03:44,082
It's just, you know... you know
a lot about books and shit.

646
01:03:44,182 --> 01:03:47,827
I just thought I might even learn
some Hajji Shakespeare or some shit.

647
01:03:49,587 --> 01:03:52,796
<i>Shakespeare? Is that the only poet you know?</i>

648
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,334
<i>I studied English.</i>

649
01:03:59,797 --> 01:04:03,219
What, you... you minor
in sniping or something?

650
01:04:04,635 --> 01:04:08,340
<i>I was a teacher in Baghdad,
but a bomb hit my school.</i>

651
01:04:09,007 --> 01:04:11,444
Hey, you got it? Shane.

652
01:04:11,844 --> 01:04:14,412
<i>I got shrapnel in my left elbow. Still hurts.</i>

653
01:04:14,512 --> 01:04:17,316
Fucking trash heap behind the white trailer.

654
01:04:18,416 --> 01:04:22,187
- 1,550.
- <i>It reminds me of the students I lost.</i>

655
01:04:22,287 --> 01:04:26,340
Go on, baby. Go on, baby, let's do this.

656
01:04:27,592 --> 01:04:30,488
<i>Is that why you shoot civilian contractors?</i>

657
01:04:32,396 --> 01:04:35,034
<i>As the scripture says, an eye for an eye.</i>

658
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,470
That's bullshit.

659
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:41,206
You're no more religious than I am, man.

660
01:04:41,506 --> 01:04:44,744
That's just a fucking excuse
to shoot up some Americans.

661
01:04:46,144 --> 01:04:47,980
You're good, man.

662
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:51,472
Just keep going slow, baby, real slow.

663
01:04:52,084 --> 01:04:55,321
- <i>Is that a question, Isaac?</i>
- Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.

664
01:04:56,521 --> 01:04:59,151
Yeah, that's right.

665
01:05:03,928 --> 01:05:06,298
<i>You see, that's what I don't get.</i>

666
01:05:06,398 --> 01:05:10,628
<i>How's an educated person like you
become a fucking terrorist?</i>

667
01:05:13,405 --> 01:05:15,207
You tell me.

668
01:05:15,975 --> 01:05:18,177
Shut your fucking mouth.

669
01:05:18,377 --> 01:05:20,179
<i>You're fading, Isaac.</i>

670
01:05:21,179 --> 01:05:23,849
You like to hear yourself talk, don't you?

671
01:05:24,649 --> 01:05:26,697
I'm fucking fantastic.

672
01:05:27,719 --> 01:05:29,722
Chilling like a villain, baby.

673
01:05:30,322 --> 01:05:32,324
<i>You are not fantastic.</i>

674
01:05:32,624 --> 01:05:34,459
<i>You have no water.</i>

675
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:36,395
<i>You're dehydrated.</i>

676
01:05:37,896 --> 01:05:41,145
<i>The sun is... the sun's baking you.</i>

677
01:05:44,768 --> 01:05:46,416
<i>You're bleeding to death.</i>

678
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:01,353
Cap...

679
01:06:02,053 --> 01:06:03,255
Cap...

680
01:06:03,855 --> 01:06:06,458
- Captain Albright.
- <i>What's that?</i>

681
01:06:06,558 --> 01:06:08,393
A legend.

682
01:06:09,093 --> 01:06:11,355
Trained me. Trained Dean, too.

683
01:06:12,998 --> 01:06:14,833
He's coming for us.

684
01:06:14,933 --> 01:06:18,637
- <i>For your bodies.</i>
- When we don't report in, he's on your ass.

685
01:06:18,737 --> 01:06:21,727
<i>Judging from your and Matthews'
performances, I'm not concerned.</i>

686
01:06:21,827 --> 01:06:25,469
Fuck you. He's coming for us.

687
01:06:33,017 --> 01:06:34,829
He trained us.

688
01:06:36,488 --> 01:06:38,558
Trained us to survive.

689
01:06:39,758 --> 01:06:42,186
<i>And won't he be disappointed?</i>

690
01:06:44,927 --> 01:06:46,731
<i>You didn't win shit.</i>

691
01:06:47,831 --> 01:06:50,868
<i>You hear me, motherfucker?
You didn't win shit.</i>

692
01:06:55,472 --> 01:06:57,941
From a place you will not see...

693
01:06:58,276 --> 01:07:00,979
...comes a sound you will not hear.

694
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:03,741
Just a flash of fucking light.

695
01:07:04,949 --> 01:07:06,535
Boom.

696
01:07:14,258 --> 01:07:16,892
<i>When I'm done with you and Matthews...</i>

697
01:07:16,992 --> 01:07:19,864
<i>...everyone will know who the winner is.</i>

698
01:07:37,481 --> 01:07:39,043
Shane!

699
01:07:41,752 --> 01:07:44,181
Hold still, man, hold still.

700
01:07:52,195 --> 01:07:54,366
<i>Should I take Sergeant Matthews' head off?</i>

701
01:07:54,466 --> 01:07:56,822
Shit. Hold still, man.

702
01:07:56,922 --> 01:08:00,138
- Don't fucking move.
- <i>Will you take something from Matthews?</i>

703
01:08:00,238 --> 01:08:02,273
<i>Like your broken scope?</i>

704
01:08:02,373 --> 01:08:04,837
<i>He's in my crosshairs right now.</i>

705
01:08:05,777 --> 01:08:07,646
I've got eyes on him.

706
01:08:08,246 --> 01:08:09,681
<i>What?</i>

707
01:08:09,781 --> 01:08:12,070
I don't make empty threats, Isaac.

708
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:15,221
<i>I'm going to tear his face off.</i>

709
01:08:16,421 --> 01:08:18,056
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

710
01:08:18,156 --> 01:08:21,093
I carry around the scope
because it reminds me...

711
01:08:21,193 --> 01:08:24,617
...why I can't hold a sc...
hold a rifle again.

712
01:08:29,533 --> 01:08:31,036
Okay?

713
01:08:31,436 --> 01:08:33,307
You listening to me?

714
01:08:35,607 --> 01:08:37,475
Dean dropped it...

715
01:08:37,875 --> 01:08:41,280
...the scope, in the line of duty. He fell
over trying to pick it up and I missed...

716
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:44,817
...I missed the sniper, okay?
You fucking listening to me?

717
01:08:46,017 --> 01:08:49,046
I didn't see him.
That's how he got hit. It was my fault.

718
01:08:49,146 --> 01:08:51,133
Goddamn it, you fucking listening?

719
01:09:05,902 --> 01:09:09,107
No. Slower, man. Slower, slower.

720
01:09:09,207 --> 01:09:10,701
<i>Slower what?</i>

721
01:09:12,676 --> 01:09:14,565
<i>What's going on?</i>

722
01:09:17,715 --> 01:09:19,677
Who are you talking to?

723
01:09:24,322 --> 01:09:26,349
Who am I talking to?

724
01:09:27,208 --> 01:09:29,420
<i>I'm talking to fucking God!</i>

725
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:35,667
He's 30 feet up...

726
01:09:35,767 --> 01:09:38,202
...in the trash somewhere!

727
01:09:38,302 --> 01:09:40,305
I don't fucking know.

728
01:09:40,405 --> 01:09:42,241
I'm sorry, man.

729
01:09:43,241 --> 01:09:45,389
Give me max plus four!

730
01:09:47,211 --> 01:09:49,360
Six mils right!

731
01:09:50,741 --> 01:09:52,552
Send when ready!

732
01:09:54,052 --> 01:09:55,579
Fuck.

733
01:10:03,461 --> 01:10:05,284
Did you get him?

734
01:10:07,331 --> 01:10:09,500
Please tell me you got him.

735
01:10:10,058 --> 01:10:12,871
- Fuck.
- Fuck!

736
01:10:12,971 --> 01:10:15,540
- You bastard. You fucking...
- Fuck me.

737
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:18,196
Just fucking let him go, you piece of shit!

738
01:10:19,276 --> 01:10:21,680
Shane, get up, man!

739
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:25,318
He ain't a threat to you anymore.
Just fucking let him go.

740
01:10:25,418 --> 01:10:30,014
- Goddamn it. Fuck, fuck.
- Don't fucking stop! Don't fucking stop!

741
01:10:31,573 --> 01:10:35,836
Just like that. Just like that, baby.
Just go! Fuck. Come on, man!

742
01:10:35,936 --> 01:10:37,054
Move!

743
01:10:41,299 --> 01:10:43,875
Keep coming, man! You're almost there!

744
01:10:49,474 --> 01:10:51,969
Come on. Just like that, man.

745
01:10:53,684 --> 01:10:57,148
Reach for me. Reach for me!

746
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:21,786
Why? Why?

747
01:11:34,151 --> 01:11:36,155
I want to go home!

748
01:11:36,755 --> 01:11:39,391
I want to go fucking home, motherfucker.

749
01:11:39,891 --> 01:11:42,827
<i>So go. Walk away.</i>

750
01:11:42,927 --> 01:11:46,114
- You'll just fucking shoot me.
- <i>No, I won't.</i>

751
01:11:46,214 --> 01:11:49,618
Yes, you fucking will. Why wouldn't you?

752
01:11:49,718 --> 01:11:52,120
<i>Because that's not really what you want.</i>

753
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:53,723
What?

754
01:11:54,723 --> 01:11:56,984
<i>You don't want to go home, do you?</i>

755
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:01,064
The fuck's that mean, man?

756
01:12:02,764 --> 01:12:05,393
<i>The war's over. You're still here.</i>

757
01:12:09,503 --> 01:12:11,065
<i>Why?</i>

758
01:12:27,855 --> 01:12:29,717
I killed him.

759
01:12:32,359 --> 01:12:34,163
I did.

760
01:12:34,963 --> 01:12:36,999
He went to go confirm a kill.

761
01:12:37,499 --> 01:12:39,334
Enemy sniper.

762
01:12:39,434 --> 01:12:42,404
The guy was playing possum.
Started shooting at Dean.

763
01:12:42,504 --> 01:12:45,749
I tried shooting back,
but the bullet went right through Dean.

764
01:12:56,550 --> 01:13:00,243
Oh, man, I lied! I fucking lied so much!

765
01:13:02,423 --> 01:13:04,690
Trying to keep the story straight.

766
01:13:09,763 --> 01:13:11,800
I lied to everybody.

767
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:15,963
I lied to every single person,
except you, a fucking Hajj!

768
01:13:40,562 --> 01:13:42,256
Are you there?

769
01:13:45,799 --> 01:13:49,000
You listening to me? Do you hear me?

770
01:13:50,571 --> 01:13:54,223
Where are you, man? Where do you keep going?

771
01:14:07,855 --> 01:14:09,716
No, something's off.

772
01:15:12,454 --> 01:15:15,856
<i>Spartan Thirty Three,
this is Mobile HQ Actual.</i>

773
01:15:17,859 --> 01:15:21,488
<i>Spartan Thirty Three,
this is Mobile HQ Actual.</i>

774
01:15:22,864 --> 01:15:25,834
This is Spartan 33! How copy?

775
01:15:25,934 --> 01:15:28,731
<i>Spartan 33 confirmed. Name and rank?</i>

776
01:15:28,831 --> 01:15:31,306
- Sar'nt A...
- <i>Sergeant Allen B. Isaac.</i>

777
01:15:32,774 --> 01:15:35,910
- <i>Good to hear you again, Sar'nt.</i>
- What the fuck?

778
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:40,115
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hey, Cap, Cap!
- <i>Any sign of the shooter in the last hour?</i>

779
01:15:40,215 --> 01:15:43,452
- <i>No, still quiet. We're chilling like villains.</i>
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

780
01:15:43,552 --> 01:15:47,485
- Cap, cap! This is Sar'nt Allen B. Isaac...
- <i>What's Matthews' status?</i>

781
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:49,537
<i>He's stable, sir.</i>

782
01:15:50,057 --> 01:15:51,580
No, no!

783
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:55,029
- Captain Albright!
- <i>All due respect, Cap...</i>

784
01:15:55,129 --> 01:15:57,231
<i>...that's what y'all said an hour ago.</i>

785
01:15:57,331 --> 01:15:59,735
<i>Can I get an updated ETA?</i>

786
01:15:59,835 --> 01:16:03,338
- <i>ETA about an hour 20.</i>
- <i>Copy that.</i>

787
01:16:03,438 --> 01:16:06,008
- Fuck. Don't do this, man.
- <i>We're getting baked out here.</i>

788
01:16:06,108 --> 01:16:07,910
<i>Little out of it.</i>

789
01:16:19,454 --> 01:16:21,493
That guy called for us.

790
01:16:21,593 --> 01:16:23,425
<i>Fucking Hajjis.</i>

791
01:16:23,725 --> 01:16:26,419
<i>Just hoping you get here before nightfall.</i>

792
01:16:28,196 --> 01:16:31,291
How many times you done this,
you motherfucker?

793
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:34,202
<i>Could've fooled me.</i>

794
01:16:37,105 --> 01:16:40,308
