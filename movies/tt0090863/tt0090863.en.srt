{1234}{1278}9-ball is rotation pool.
{1282}{1350}The balls are pocketed|in numbered order.
{1354}{1398}The only ball|that means anything...
{1402}{1470}that wins it,|is the 9.
{1474}{1564}The player can shoot|eight trick shots in a row...
{1568}{1642}blow the 9, and lose.
{1686}{1718}On the other hand...
{1722}{1790}the player can get|the 9 in on the break...
{1794}{1866}if the balls spread right,|and win.
{1870}{1994}Which is to say that luck|plays a part in 9-ball.
{1998}{2048}But for some players...
{2103}{2169}Iuck itself is an art.
{4523}{4574}Colour.
{4578}{4624}Check the colour.
{4628}{4680}Dead giveaway,|you know?
{4684}{4770}It's thick.|You can almost feel it.
{4774}{4858}Lay down and let it|roll all over you.
{4862}{4898}That's single malt.
{4947}{5025}On the other hand,|you got something like Old Mcdonnell.
{5029}{5090}More like Young Mcdonnell,|actually.
{5094}{5180}Tastes like|6-year-old bonded.
{5184}{5229}Smell this.
{5252}{5282}Mmm.
{5286}{5346}Hmm?
{5461}{5499}That's good stuff.
{5503}{5560}Yeah.
{5564}{5626}Very good stuff.
{5630}{5710}I can get you a case|for $35.50 less...
{5714}{5808}than your wholesaler|can get you a case of Jack Daniel's.
{5812}{5895}Go peddle that to one|of your hotel chains.
{5899}{5927}Peddle?
{5931}{6012}I don't do that, do l?|This is family.
{6016}{6072}I'm glad|to see you, too.
{6076}{6119}Come to my house|tonight.
{6123}{6168}I'll make you|an omelet.
{6172}{6203}I'll make the omelets.
{6207}{6299}Did you forget the omelet|I made you last time?
{6303}{6323}No.
{6327}{6360}What was in it?
{6364}{6388}Sweet sausage.
{6392}{6417}Sweet sausage.
{6421}{6508}Hey, I never made you|sweet sausage.
{6512}{6535}Eddie.
{6539}{6611}Come on,|what was in it?
{6615}{6647}Sour.
{6651}{6695}Sour cream|and caviar, right?
{6699}{6755}Okay. Excuse me.
{6759}{6783}Eddie.
{6787}{6831}Julian,|am I working?
{6835}{6868}I'm working, too.
{6872}{6939}This guy is up|for 20 a rack.
{6943}{6971}What guy?
{7087}{7155}Playing 2, 2 1/2 hours|for 5 a game.
{7159}{7199}He's up 300.
{7203}{7252}I've been|playing him off.
{7355}{7411}Yo, Vincent!
{7415}{7460}Vincent, we're on.
{7491}{7555}Hey, Vincent.
{7558}{7681}Can you believe this guy?|Hey, Vinnie.
{7685}{7778}You slide this stuff|into a bottle of Old Granddad...
{7782}{7852}you'd hardly be lying.
{7856}{7948}Pick me up.|I get off at 10:00.
{7952}{7995}Not without me|you don't.
{7999}{8034}Do you?
{8038}{8071}Lately...
{8075}{8131}Wait a minute.|I'm talking bourbon.
{8135}{8178}You know the secret?
{8182}{8251}These people get a hold|of aged kegs.
{8255}{8319}You're tasting|low fusel oil content.
{8323}{8395}Just like the big guys.|It's the kegs.
{8399}{8455}Where do you get|the kegs?
{8459}{8490}Hey.
{8494}{8563}That was fast.|What the hell happened?
{8567}{8610}I slipped.
{8614}{8670}He slipped.
{8674}{8728}Where do they get|the kegs?
{8732}{8800}They just do.|Do whatever you want.
{8804}{8880}It'll leave the warehouse|one way or another.
{8885}{8973}On the snap, Vincent.
{8976}{9042}That kid's got|a sledgehammer break.
{9140}{9172}Bottoms up.
{9176}{9245}Do you know who|loves this stuff?
{9249}{9281}The Chinese.
{9285}{9352}It must be the low|fusel oil content.
{9356}{9424}Don't kid yourself.|It has its effect.
{9428}{9520}It's like those things|you take for granted, like electricity.
{9524}{9569}Eddie, loan me|another 20.
{9573}{9628}Who you working,|me or him?
{9632}{9718}He's on the ropes.|He just lucked out.
{9722}{9764}You know me, right?
{9768}{9809}Take it easy.
{9813}{9837}Woo!
{9841}{9895}Woo! Woo! Woo!
{9962}{9995}Victory.
{10219}{10287}Pick us out|a nice bottle of wine.
{10291}{10329}Red or white?
{10333}{10389}On the snap, Vincent.
{10543}{10599}Hey, Eddie,|about those labels.
{10603}{10683}Can you get me|some Wild Turkey labels?
{10687}{10719}Sure.

{11470}{11545}{Y:i}And if you should|sail away
{11549}{11633}{Y:i}I will follow you
{11637}{11704}{Y:i}Give me one more night

{12633}{12676}Show me|what you got.
{12680}{12705}Vincent.
{12709}{12780}Julian, I just want|your best game.
{12784}{12829}I think the money's|throwing you off today.
{12833}{12885}{Y:i}...One more night
{12889}{12977}{Y:i}'Cause I can't|wait forever
{12981}{13039}How about I win,|no money.

{13095}{13170}{Y:i}One more night
{13174}{13223}No?
{13227}{13346}{Y:i}'Cause I can't|wait forever
{13350}{13419}What's the matter|with this guy?
{13423}{13483}All right, Carmen,|who's next?
{13487}{13516}Nobody.
{13556}{13588}Hey.
{13592}{13636}You want to play me?
{13640}{13675}For your girlfriend.
{13679}{13707}One game.
{13711}{13736}No.
{13740}{13795}I'll spot you|the 7 and 8.
{13799}{13868}I'll give you|the table.
{13887}{13940}You want to play him?
{13943}{13987}Me?
{13991}{14036}Sure.
{14040}{14083}20 a rack.
{14087}{14144}No. 500 a rack.
{14148}{14193}Oh, you serious?
{14243}{14288}I never kid|about money.
{14292}{14328}Ha ha ha ha!
{14332}{14359}Cowards!
{14363}{14409}Off with their heads.
{14519}{14588}You don't know|what you're doing, do you?
{14592}{14636}What do you mean?
{14640}{14696}Well, you just blew|500 bucks.
{14700}{14769}That kid, he has both arms|in traction...
{14773}{14828}he beats anybody|in the room.
{14832}{14864}Yeah, he could.
{14868}{14936}So I'll offer it|to you again.
{14940}{15021}I'll play him|for 500 bucks.
{15025}{15092}You don't know|what to say, do you?
{15096}{15164}Maybe I'm hustling you,|maybe I'm not.
{15168}{15236}You don't know,|but you should know.
{15240}{15333}If you know that,|you know when to say no.
{15337}{15381}What should I say?
{15385}{15428}You should say no.
{15432}{15488}Why? Because|it's too much money
{15492}{15560}and I'm an unknown.
{15564}{15644}He should be the unknown.
{15648}{15692}That would be nice.
{15696}{15740}That would|be beautiful.
{15744}{15824}You could play around|with that.
{15828}{15872}You could control that.
{15876}{15930}I'll offer it|to you again.
{15934}{15978}I'll play him|for 500 bucks.
{15982}{16030}No.
{16034}{16090}Actually,|you should have said yes.
{16094}{16151}It's very hard|to know that.
{16155}{16190}It's very complex...
{16194}{16262}Iike which twin|has got the Toni.
{16266}{16322}Maybe they both|got the Toni.
{16326}{16398}Maybe Toni's a guy.|It's very complicated.
{16402}{16447}Plus it's too much money.
{16451}{16483}God, you're crazy.
{16487}{16545}No, I'm not.|Just common sense.
{16585}{16677}How about I take you guys|out for dinner tonight?
{16714}{16758}You should ask Vincent.
{16762}{16817}No. You should|ask Vincent.
{17050}{17130}You know the last time|Julian lost for me?
{17134}{17238}It's just a game, man.|Some balls and a stick.
{17242}{17287}9-ball's not that tough.
{17291}{17333}Stalker is tough.
{17337}{17389}It's his video game.
{17393}{17436}Vincent's the best|at it.
{17440}{17508}In pool, you just|got these balls.
{17512}{17584}You take your time,|set up a shot.
{17588}{17677}Can you make any money|playing Stalker?
{17681}{17758}I'll tell you what|I can do off Stalker.
{17762}{17854}10 years from now,|I can go to West Point.
{17858}{17926}It's all coming down|to video-game reflexes.
{17930}{17975}Computerized tanks,|Star Wars.
{17979}{18053}In 10 years,|a heavy scorer on Stalker...
{18057}{18117}is a shoo-in|at the Point.
{18121}{18172}You are beautiful.
{18176}{18242}What do you mean,|"money"?
{18246}{18277}Money money.
{18281}{18327}Really?
{18331}{18361}Hey, look.
{18365}{18429}If you got an area|of excellence...
{18432}{18489}you're the best|at something, anything...
{18493}{18537}then rich|can be arranged.
{18541}{18585}Rich can come|fairly easy.
{18589}{18625}Really?
{18629}{18710}You got some other|area of excellence besides Stalker?
{18714}{18760}9-ball, right?
{18764}{18841}You're some|piece of work.
{18845}{18883}You're also|a natural character.
{18887}{18970}I've been telling her that.|I got natural character.
{18974}{19026}That's not|what I said, kid.
{19030}{19116}I said you are|a natural character.
{19120}{19160}You're|an incredible flake.
{19164}{19207}But that's a gift.
{19211}{19279}Guys spend half their lives|inventing that.
{19283}{19370}You walk into a poolroom|with that "go, go, go..."
{19374}{19425}guys will be|killing each other...
{19429}{19471}trying to get|to you.
{19475}{19507}You got that.
{19511}{19567}But I'll tell you|something, kiddo.
{19571}{19615}You couldn't|find big time...
{19619}{19663}if you had|a road map.
{19667}{19739}Pool excellence is not about|excellent pool.
{19743}{19791}It's about|becoming something.
{19795}{19855}Yeah?
{19859}{19916}Yeah.
{19920}{19955}Like what?
{19959}{20013}You got to be a student...
{20017}{20049}of human moves.
{20053}{20121}See, all the greats|that I know of...
{20125}{20180}were students|of human moves.
{20184}{20256}Students|of human moves?
{20260}{20347}Yeah. That's my area|of excellence.
{20351}{20389}Oh, yeah?
{20393}{20441}Yeah.
{20445}{20477}Ahem.
{20481}{20517}What?
{20553}{20621}What?
{20631}{20718}That guy at the end|of the bar...
{20721}{20801}he's been hustling that broad|for half an hour.
{20805}{20887}He's going to throw in the towel|in 300 seconds for a buck.
{20891}{20946}You got it.|Starting now.
{20950}{20981}10 seconds.
{20985}{21060}What do you mean,|rich can be arranged?
{21064}{21101}Shh.
{21105}{21145}22, 23, 24...
{21149}{21209}25, 26, 27, 28.
{21213}{21262}Guess the news.|You lose.
{21309}{21396}And I just missed it|by a couple of seconds.
{21400}{21470}Want to up the bet?
{21474}{21511}Yeah.
{21515}{21630}Check for the meal says|I leave with her in two minutes.
{21705}{21745}Okay. Ready, go.
{21749}{21815}Now. I'm counting.
{21873}{21928}I know this will|sound crazy...
{21932}{22024}but would you come outside|and look at my car?
{22028}{22060}Your car?
{22064}{22141}Yeah.
{22145}{22182}Come on.
{22268}{22326}Hold it here|for a second.
{22496}{22543}Human moves, kid.
{22547}{22601}You study the watch...
{22605}{22649}but I study you.
{22653}{22714}You get the check.|Excuse me.
{22809}{22850}Cab's on me.
{22975}{23018}What's with|the car, Eddie?
{23022}{23064}Nothing.|I'll drive you home.
{23068}{23147}I hated to see you|sitting alone.
{23151}{23195}Did you see Julian?
{23199}{23267}Yeah. Does he still|got his nighttime job?
{23271}{23391}He wanted to talk to you,|but you were busy.
{23513}{23553}Where did you go?
{23557}{23597}What?
{23601}{23647}You certainly|weren't here.
{23651}{23731}Oh, yeah?|Where was l?
{23791}{23835}God, the earth moved.
{23839}{23907}Didn't it move|for you a little bit?
{23911}{23957}That was a train.
{24007}{24053}No, it was you...
{24092}{24182}but it certainly wasn't San Juan.
{24186}{24267}I mean, if you're going to talk|earth moving...
{24271}{24327}you got to talk San Juan.
{24331}{24412}Remember that waterbed we had?
{24416}{24459}God!
{24463}{24517}Sometimes I think about that week.
{24521}{24565}When I'm behind the bar...
{24569}{24673}I think,|"l'm going to get me a waterbed..."
{24677}{24709}and not tell anybody...
{24713}{24784}Just make it a surprise.
{24830}{24896}Get some rum and pineapple juice.
{24941}{25022}You couldn't tell me|one word I just said...
{25026}{25057}could you?
{25061}{25105}No, I couldn't.
{25109}{25194}Waterbed, rum, pineapple juice.
{25198}{25255}Not that, it's...
{25293}{25353}I don't know,|that kid today...
{25357}{25451}it was like watching|a home movie.
{25489}{25557}Ah, it just|made me wonder.
{25561}{25599}Wonder what?
{25645}{25715}It made me wonder|about San Juan.
{26012}{26064}What did you mean|last night about money...
{26068}{26119}and all that stuff?
{26180}{26237}I want to show you|something.
{26686}{26730}So this is|liquor money.
{26734}{26834}Some. Do you know|what I invest in?
{26838}{26881}Excellence.
{26928}{26983}You think Vincent's|that good?
{26987}{27092}Well, he's got the eye.|He's got the stroke.
{27096}{27158}He's got the flake|down cold...
{27162}{27228}but can he flake on|and flake off?
{27232}{27292}I don't know whether|that can be taught.
{27296}{27361}He's got to learn how to be himself,|but on purpose.
{27389}{27416}Yeah.
{27420}{27463}Do you like to travel?
{27467}{27488}Yeah.
{27492}{27542}You like hotels?
{27546}{27576}They're okay.
{27580}{27660}Are you going to|help me with him?
{27732}{27813}That lady you picked up|last night--
{27817}{27881}you knew her|from before, right?
{27932}{27956}Mm-hmm.
{27960}{27989}And the guy.
{27993}{28078}You probably had his schedule|down cold.
{28082}{28139}Maybe he's your|brother-in-law.
{28143}{28198}You're a hard broad.
{28202}{28262}What does Vincent|see in you?
{28266}{28302}Vincent's the best.
{28306}{28377}That's what|he sees in me.
{28381}{28447}We've just been together|about a year.
{28451}{28532}Vincent made us|get a place together.
{28536}{28590}You know how we met?
{28594}{28649}My old boyfriend|last year got busted
{28653}{28710}breaking into Vincent's|parents' house.
{28714}{28773}We met|at the police station.
{28777}{28831}You were bailing|your boyfriend out.
{28835}{28877}No. I got|busted, too.
{28881}{28926}I was driving|the car.
{28930}{28962}See this?
{28966}{29001}Look.
{29050}{29083}Vincent's mother's.
{29087}{29130}He gave that to you?
{29134}{29181}Nope.|From the robbery.
{29218}{29322}Vince says his mother|has one just like it.
{29326}{29398}He's sweet.
{29402}{29448}Vincent's real sweet.
{29685}{29781}The problem with this one|is that it's made in Taiwan.
{29785}{29863}You want something|for your kid to bounce in.
{29867}{29898}What animal bounces?
{29902}{29927}Kangaroo.
{29931}{29971}It comes from Australia.
{29975}{30007}This is|Australian made.
{30011}{30055}It's twice|as expensive...
{30059}{30127}but it's three times|better than Taiwan.
{30131}{30163}I'll take 15 off.
{30167}{30199}Yeah, okay.
{30203}{30260}All right,|Mr and Mrs Randall...
{30264}{30306}it's a good buy.

{30370}{30438}If you ever need anything,|Vincent, okay?
{30442}{30474}Thanks.
{30478}{30546}Mr Felson,|what can I do you for?
{30550}{30582}Eddie is okay.
{30586}{30654}In fact, just plain Ed|if you want.
{30658}{30702}Ed. Yes, sir.
{30706}{30752}Can we talk privately?
{30814}{30882}There's a 9-ball tournament,|end of April.
{30886}{30971}I think|we ought to go.
{30975}{31021}We?
{31025}{31072}Yeah. Me, you,|and Carmen.
{31076}{31144}Yeah? That sounds|like a lot of fun.
{31148}{31197}We ought to|leave tomorrow.
{31201}{31265}Tomorrow.|Why not leave today?
{31269}{31328}What is it|with this guy?
{31332}{31371}If you're going to|take the plunge...
{31375}{31434}give yourself|a fair shake.
{31438}{31483}Don't go half-assed.
{31487}{31612}Go on the road for six weeks.|Get some seasoning.
{31616}{31666}Why don't you|ask Julian?
{31670}{31711}Julian's known.|You're nobody.
{31715}{31782}I get better bets|with you.
{31786}{31819}If there's|some other way...
{31823}{31904}that I can be|honest with you, tell me.
{31908}{31966}This is my job, Eddie.
{31970}{32023}You think so?
{32027}{32079}That's funny.|I don't think so.
{32083}{32130}I think|it's your problem.
{32172}{32209}What is?
{32213}{32282}Well, you're hooked|on Carmen, aren't you?
{32315}{32348}Yeah.
{32352}{32382}Crazy about her?
{32435}{32494}You're getting|a little personal here.
{32611}{32646}What?
{32650}{32695}You're losing her,|kiddo.
{32699}{32743}What do you mean?
{32747}{32815}She don't get the allure|of this place.
{32819}{32854}Hey, Vincent.
{32858}{32883}Wait.
{32887}{32945}Take a good look|at her.
{32949}{32994}She's starting|to pack.
{33067}{33113}You don't know her.
{33117}{33195}I didn't know that broad|at that bar either.
{33199}{33253}She's bored, Vincent.
{33257}{33327}Are you listening|to what I'm telling you?
{33331}{33379}What are you saying?
{33383}{33448}You, me, her on the road.|Six weeks.
{33452}{33521}She'll be a couple years|catching her breath.
{33525}{33575}Vincent,|these people--
{33579}{33619}Lou, I'm talking here.
{33623}{33690}Do me a favour.|Take care of them.
{33694}{33755}He's late|for his coffee break.
{33759}{33823}Go on,|get back to work...
{33826}{33881}but think|about it, okay?
{33885}{33962}Take your time.|I'll give you five seconds.
{33966}{34010}Five seconds.
{34014}{34063}You know where|to find me...
{34067}{34110}if you want to talk.
{34114}{34184}Vincent.|Don't worry about it.
{34487}{34551}{Y:i}lf I can hold you|tonight
{34555}{34600}{Y:i}I might never let go...
{34604}{34662}If anybody asks,|I'll be in the back.
{34666}{34707}{Y:i}I might never let go
{34711}{34763}{Y:i}lf I can hold you|tonight
{34805}{34839}Come on in.
{34951}{34986}Hey, Eddie.
{35047}{35116}Uh... what we were|talking about yesterday...
{35120}{35211}I just wanted to ask you|some questions about it.
{35215}{35271}What happens?
{35275}{35322}I mean, what happens?
{35467}{35498}Damn.
{35539}{35571}It's a Balabushka.
{35575}{35610}It's beautiful.
{35614}{35691}It makes the others|look like stickball bats.
{35695}{35732}This yours?
{35736}{35776}You want it?
{35780}{35812}No.
{35816}{35860}This isn't for me.
{35864}{35932}I don't know|who this is for.
{35936}{35979}No, this isn't for me.
{35983}{36051}John Wayne would carry|something like this...
{36055}{36111}if he played pool.
{36115}{36171}Babe Ruth.
{36175}{36208}No. I...
{36259}{36330}No, I can't accept this.
{36334}{36376}Go ahead, take it.
{36451}{36494}You're pushing|pretty hard.
{36498}{36530}You betcha.
{36534}{36620}I've been thinking|about nothing else all day.
{36711}{36779}I don't know|what to tell you, Eddie.
{36783}{36823}It doesn't matter.
{36827}{36871}Go outside.|Horse around with it.
{36875}{36946}You don't like it,|bring it back.
{37033}{37059}Eddie.
{37063}{37118}Hey, Eddie.
{37122}{37197}I was talking to Carmen|the other night...
{37201}{37250}feeling her out.
{37254}{37288}Oh, Willie.|Wait a minute.
{37292}{37341}Sorry. Go ahead.
{37345}{37440}I said I was talking to Carmen|the other night...
{37444}{37473}feeling her out.
{37477}{37522}I think|you're wrong, man.
{37526}{37584}She's doing real good.
{37588}{37640}Okay. I'm glad I'm wrong.
{37644}{37678}Willie.
{37740}{37784}No. I don't know.
{37788}{37856}I can make it|in half an hour.
{37860}{37886}Sure.
{38268}{38312}Where's Carmen,|my girlfriend?
{38316}{38372}She just went|in the bathroom.
{38376}{38432}You know|what this is?
{38436}{38492}Balabushka.
{38496}{38528}Balabushka?
{38532}{38588}Where'd you get|a Balabushka?
{38592}{38648}Eddie Felson|gave it to me.
{38652}{38696}Eddie gave you|a Balabushka?
{38700}{38756}Yeah.
{38760}{38804}You know|what that's worth?
{38808}{38840}Yeah.
{38844}{38910}That guy died|about 15 years ago.
{38914}{38995}It must be|a collector's item.
{38999}{39052}{Y:i}...Snake's in the garden
{39056}{39100}{Y:i}Apple's on the tree
{39104}{39163}{Y:i}All of this|looks easy
{39167}{39231}{Y:i}None of this is free
{39234}{39282}{Y:i}You might get lucky
{39286}{39334}{Y:i}Got the will to win
{39338}{39379}{Y:i}You need a little failure
{39383}{39438}{Y:i}To thicken your skin
{39442}{39498}{Y:i}Everybody's talking
{39502}{39563}{Y:i}They promise you the moon
{39567}{39616}{Y:i}It's made of paper
{39620}{39679}{Y:i}And you find out|pretty soon
{39683}{39772}{Y:i}Who owns this place?
{39776}{39799}{Y:i}Who?
{39803}{39882}{Y:i}Who owns this place?
{39886}{39956}{Y:i}I'm talking to you...
{39995}{40038}It's my word|against yours.
{40042}{40098}I'm a rare book|expert.
{40102}{40146}Have you seen|my girlfriend?
{40150}{40183}She went out.
{40187}{40215}Where?
{40219}{40260}Hey, she's|your girlfriend.
{40345}{40373}Hey.
{40377}{40408}Everything okay?
{40412}{40444}Yeah.
{40448}{40492}Where'd you go?
{40496}{40540}I went out|for cigs.
{40544}{40588}They sell cigarettes|right here.
{40592}{40661}So I got them|across the street.
{40665}{40733}You needed|some fresh air, right?
{40737}{40768}What's your problem?
{40772}{40852}No problem.|There's no problem.
{40856}{40907}I'm glad to hear it.
{40911}{40968}I just didn't know|where you went.
{40972}{41044}I'm going to sit down now.|Is that okay?
{41048}{41088}Yeah.
{41092}{41143}I might go to the bathroom|in about half an hour. Is that okay?
{41147}{41232}I'll be sure|and tell you when.
{41236}{41262}Hey, look.
{41266}{41335}I just didn't know|where you went.
{41339}{41430}Let's not make a federal production|out of this, okay?
{41434}{41466}Okay!
{41470}{41504}Okay.
{41603}{41679}It's a Balabushka.|Eddie gave it to me.
{41683}{41716}Great.
{42100}{42145}{Y:i}Who owns this place?
{42740}{42796}Excuse me. Eddie?
{42800}{42845}I've been thinking|about it.
{42849}{42893}Let's do it, okay?
{42897}{42927}Great.
{43226}{43282}I wonder|what's upstairs.
{43286}{43311}Why?
{43315}{43373}Well, there might|be something soft...
{43377}{43445}for you|to lean against...
{43449}{43520}so I don't|crush your skirt.
{43713}{43788}In the Bahamas,|do they tango or rumba?
{43792}{43829}Samba, I think.
{43904}{43972}How's that Old Mcdonnell|working out?
{43976}{44020}You're drinking|it now.
{44024}{44068}You're serious.
{44072}{44160}- It's good stuff.|- It's very good stuff.
{44164}{44228}Yo, Eddie,|my man, hey.
{44232}{44260}Why don't you|look in the mirror...
{44264}{44308}before you leave|the john?
{44312}{44356}I hate that shit.
{44384}{44428}Better than|that shit.
{44432}{44476}Will you be|around Monday?
{44480}{44536}A guy's set up|in Camden.
{44540}{44621}No. I'll be out of|town for a few weeks.
{44625}{44663}Bullshit.
{44667}{44726}What, you're taking that guy|on the road? What's his name?
{44730}{44763}It's none|of your business.
{44767}{44829}He's a chump.|He beat me one night.
{44833}{44877}I'll put the 9-ball|up both your asses.
{44881}{44932}Are you serious?|Taking him on the road?
{44936}{44988}When's the last time|you did the road, 1960?
{44992}{45076}They didn't even|have cars then.
{45080}{45192}What? Come on?|You bangin' his girlfriend?
{45196}{45273}Right? You can tell me.
{45277}{45336}Jeez, you are|the best, Julian.
{45340}{45382}Let me play him|tonight.
{45386}{45455}Winner gets|in the car with you.
{45459}{45490}You're the best.
{45494}{45562}You're not the only|stake horse around.
{45566}{45611}See you|in Atlantic City.
{45615}{45666}Don't look|too hard for me.
{45734}{45778}We're going|to the Bahamas.
{45782}{45826}I just didn't say when.
{45830}{45898}Appreciate hearing about it|from that dope fiend.
{45902}{45959}I didn't want|to tell anybody.
{45963}{46006}Makes me feel great,|Eddie.
{46010}{46067}That guy sucks.|So do you!
{46071}{46126}I'm wrong,|but let me do it my way!
{46130}{46171}Do it any way|you want.
{46175}{46245}I want to go|on the road.
{46249}{46294}Your things|at my apartment...
{46298}{46366}you'll find in a suitcase|out front, okay?
{46370}{46404}Hey, wait a--
{46503}{46536}I'm sorry.
{46580}{46644}I cover all expenses--|food, room, entry fees.
{46647}{46716}For that, I get 60%|of your winnings.
{46720}{46785}I also take the losses|if you lose.
{46789}{46869}For that, I get 60%|of what you win.
{46873}{46929}60%? What are you,|a slumlord?
{46933}{46989}Honey, you find|a newcomer...
{46993}{47073}with a better deal,|come to me, we talk.
{47077}{47133}Don't worry.|I'm not going to lose often.
{47137}{47205}Yes, you will.|That's what I'll teach you.
{47209}{47268}Sometimes|if you lose, you win.
{47296}{47337}So who's|the heaviest guy?
{47341}{47385}I'm the heaviest guy,|right, Eddie?
{47389}{47445}It doesn't make sense.|It goes in streaks.
{47449}{47518}The balls roll funny|for everybody, kiddo.
{47522}{47565}There's this guy--|Grady Seasons.
{47569}{47626}He's making the most|on paper...
{47630}{47673}but that doesn't|mean anything.
{47677}{47733}The money's|in the practise room.
{47737}{47793}That's where|you get good games.
{47797}{47865}You can get wiped out|at the tournament...
{47869}{47914}hang around|the practise room...
{47918}{47986}and make more money than|the tournament winner.
{47990}{48033}Hear that?|The practise room.
{48037}{48081}Hey, watch the paint.
{48085}{48147}What? Oh.
{48151}{48202}Is that metal|on your jacket?
{48206}{48249}- Sorry.|- Shit.
{48600}{48632}I'm starved.
{48636}{48692}Rub-a-dub,|here's the grub.
{48696}{48740}My pancakes are burnt.
{48744}{48776}Wait a minute.
{48780}{48872}We ordered four on,|two up.
{48876}{48907}I don't|want sausage.
{48911}{48956}Sorry.|It's the wrong order.
{48960}{49004}That's a dead|giveaway--
{49008}{49046}Four on two.
{49050}{49087}Oh. Egg talk.
{49091}{49135}She was|the killer waitress...
{49139}{49171}at the Acropolis.
{49175}{49243}She did them a favour|and quit. Ow.
{49247}{49338}You think he's the only one|who has to work?
{49410}{49462}How come you don't|play pool any more?
{49466}{49501}I quit.
{49551}{49595}Actually,|somebody retired me.
{49599}{49653}Sometimes you meet|the wrong people.
{49657}{49725}That was a long|time ago, back east.
{49729}{49771}It's dead and buried.
{49775}{49833}I won my share|of medals.
{49837}{49917}Don't you ever feel|like picking it up again?
{49921}{49988}I mean, you're always|around those pool halls.
{49992}{50061}I'm too old.|My wheels are shot.
{50065}{50110}It's|a young man's game.
{50114}{50157}Besides,|there's drugs now.
{50161}{50217}Kids are playing|on coke, speed.
{50221}{50289}When I was younger,|it was booze.
{50293}{50336}Somehow it was|more human.
{50340}{50370}Booze, huh?
{50374}{50408}Booze. Yeah.
{50412}{50471}Wine. It goes back|to the Bible.
{50475}{50523}The Bible never mentions|amphetamines.
{50527}{50553}You religious, Eddie?
{50557}{50640}Me? I get high|on the man upstairs.
{50644}{50687}Isn't there|a masters tournament?
{50691}{50759}I seen this on television--|Them old golfers...
{50763}{50807}Iike an old-timers|tournament.
{50811}{50933}If you're too old to cut the mustard,|you can lick the jar.
{50937}{50992}Nobody ever asked me|for a refund, honey.
{50996}{51027}Not yet.
{51211}{51256}We're just talking|around things here.
{51260}{51328}It ain't about pool,|sex, love.
{51332}{51364}It's about money.
{51368}{51437}The best is the guy|with the most...
{51441}{51484}in all walks|of life.
{51488}{51556}Are you the best|liquor salesman?
{51560}{51609}You betcha.
{52016}{52084}What a way to get|your feet wet.
{52088}{52132}This place|is a classic.
{52136}{52180}Put that|in the trunk.
{52184}{52229}What will|I play with?
{52233}{52276}A house cue.
{52280}{52363}Go in with that,|nobody will come near you.
{52591}{52660}I can't believe it.|I got goose bumps.
{52664}{52696}I love it.
{52700}{52744}You watch for a while.
{52748}{52805}I got to see this guy.
{53294}{53355}I can't wait|to see what's next.
{53359}{53427}Good thing I didn't bring|the Balabushka, huh?
{53431}{53535}60%? Are we going to|divvy this up in the car?
{53539}{53573}Enough!
{53935}{53979}All right. Yes.
{53983}{54028}Had enough, junior?
{54102}{54136}Hold on.
{54269}{54313}What are you doing,|Vincent?
{54317}{54383}Beat him,|eat him, and go.
{54387}{54428}I can't take|his money.
{54432}{54479}There's a hole|in his throat.
{54483}{54528}So what?
{54532}{54573}The guy's|breaking my heart.
{54577}{54633}Look. He's on|his last legs.
{54637}{54708}It's only 60 bucks.|It's no big deal.
{54712}{54756}No big deal?
{54853}{54900}You want me|to quit?
{54904}{54993}Yeah, if you're going to|keep dumping like this.
{55033}{55100}Unless... show me.
{55104}{55149}Make it|a real performance.
{55153}{55200}Dump like|a professional.
{55204}{55260}Like|a professional.
{55407}{55474}Okay, chief,|play you for 300.
{55596}{55628}Get the car.
{55632}{55664}What for?
{55668}{55712}Just bring it|around front.
{55716}{55760}Head it that way.
{55764}{55808}That's the wrong|way, Eddie.
{55812}{55868}Just do|what I tell you.
{55872}{55906}Yeah, right.
{55992}{56072}Easy shot. I miss this, I'm a chump.
{56076}{56122}Easy. Straight in.
{56172}{56216}Tough one's the 4,|though.
{56220}{56266}I don't know.
{56304}{56350}Oh, my God, l--
{56664}{56720}Oh, my God.|Do you believe--
{56724}{56756}Don't even bother.
{56760}{56804}I just can't|hit nothing.
{56808}{56864}That's it, kid.|Where's the money?
{56868}{56912}Yeah, I know.|That's it.
{56916}{56972}Uh... Eddie?

{57024}{57076}Where's the money?
{57080}{57128}Eddie's got|the money.
{57132}{57164}Where'd they go?
{57168}{57192}They left.
{57196}{57248}Relax. Take it easy.
{57252}{57308}What's the matter|with you guys?
{57312}{57380}Get your hands off.|I'll get your money.
{57384}{57424}What are you doing?|Relax.
{57428}{57490}Take it easy!|Take it easy!
{57660}{57706}Hey! Enough!
{57792}{57831}I'm his father.
{57835}{57864}You little bastard!
{57868}{57938}I tell you|when to play.
{57942}{57978}Ease off! Family.
{57982}{58043}Get out of here,|yo-yo.
{58124}{58172}You punk,|I hope your mother...
{58176}{58234}kicks the shit|out of you.
{58296}{58340}Okay, go, go, go, go!
{58467}{58494}Where to?
{58498}{58542}Just take|the parkway south.
{58546}{58579}You never--
{58583}{58650}You never ease off|on somebody like that...
{58654}{58699}not when|there's money involved.
{58703}{58758}That's the problem|with mercy, kid.
{58762}{58809}It just ain't|professional.
{58813}{58870}Let me look|at your face.
{58933}{58961}Ah, you'll live.
{58965}{58998}You'll live,|right?
{59002}{59085}Get out of my face,|will you? Jeez.
{59207}{59238}My father.
{59242}{59291}Saved your ass.
{59295}{59370}Carmen, what's to be|learned from this?
{59374}{59431}Nice guys|finish last.
{59435}{59510}Is that original,|or did you make that up?
{59514}{59587}Vincent, you're so sexy|with that bloody lip.
{59591}{59616}Shut up.
{59663}{59719}You guys want me|to drive?
{59723}{59811}No. I'm good.
{59815}{59919}- That slime ass son-of-a-bitch.|- What?
{59923}{59966}That guy with the hole--
{59970}{60010}Stick a pool cue|down his throat.
{60014}{60083}Go back there with a fucking cannon|and blow their asses away.
{60087}{60128}Vincent,|that's gross.
{60132}{60171}Next time, kid.
{60430}{60474}One of you guys know|where the Triant Motel is?
{60478}{60539}The what?
{60543}{60567}Triant Motel.
{60571}{60642}Yeah, go left on Aurora...
{60646}{60685}and right on Seneca.
{60689}{60718}Chalkies still around?
{60722}{60776}- Chalkies?|- Yeah, it's a pool hall.
{60780}{60850}I know.|It's still around.
{60854}{60919}What, it's supposed|to move somewhere?
{60923}{60968}Some things|never change, huh?
{60972}{61025}Man, I wouldn't|bet on it.
{61131}{61163}Eddie, enter.
{61167}{61222}Hey, good morning.
{61226}{61337}Come on,|let's get going, guys.
{61341}{61448}I'm ordering room service.|You want anything?
{61452}{61495}Food-- you hungry?
{61499}{61589}I hate the weather.
{61593}{61646}Can't get room service|in a motel.
{61650}{61691}Come on,|let's check out Chalkies.
{61695}{61738}Tell your girlfriend|to get going.
{61742}{61795}Meet you in the lobby.
{61799}{61882}What about food?|I'm starved.
{61886}{61973}- Vincent?|- Yeah?
{61977}{62044}Don't change the shirt.|It's a nice touch.
{62048}{62092}And leave|the cue stick.
{62096}{62135}What's the use|of having it?
{62194}{62271}This was a nice bad|neighbourhood. Now look.
{62275}{62358}Will they all|be like this?
{62362}{62411}On your pool hall scale,|what do you rate this?
{62415}{62448}10.
{62452}{62529}At least|it's got tables.
{62619}{62663}Squeeze me in?
{62667}{62721}Table number seven|for Fast Eddie.
{62725}{62819}Yeah, see, you don't|recognize Orvis...
{62823}{62868}from way back when.
{62872}{62946}Well, son-of-a-bitch.|What the hell you doin' here?
{62950}{63011}Now you're starting|to remember.
{63015}{63098}- How long you want it for?|- Couple hours.
{63102}{63159}The last time I saw you, you|were sweeping up at Mcgeer's.
{63163}{63221}Sweeping up at Mcgeer's.|That's right.
{63225}{63281}Then I started working|here for Chalkie...
{63285}{63375}till he got scared|of the bad element.
{63379}{63443}Since then I've been|running Chalkies.
{63447}{63504}What can I do for you?|Looking for action?
{63508}{63552}Usually I steer|for 20%...
{63556}{63597}but for you,|it's 10.
{63601}{63658}My friend here|wants a game.
{63662}{63710}How you doin',|Orvis?
{63786}{63851}Wild place|you got here.
{63926}{63970}Eddie, are you|stake horsing?
{63974}{64041}Know who you got|stake horsing for you?
{64045}{64089}This here's|fast Eddie Felson.
{64093}{64188}Who the hell are you--|the end of the world?
{64192}{64245}Ease it up,|will you, Orvis?
{64249}{64298}Him I'll steer for 15...
{64302}{64328}since he's staked...
{64332}{64393}by Fast Eddie|the stake horse.
{64397}{64437}Playing 9-ball|or straight?
{64441}{64502}I'll set it up|for you.
{64506}{64571}The table will|cost you $12.
{64824}{64904}{Y:i}It's in the way|that you use it...
{64908}{64977}Maybe you should|go back to the motel.
{64981}{65012}Why?
{65016}{65060}There are|rape artists here.
{65064}{65108}Maybe you|should go back...
{65112}{65156}pretty boy|like you.
{65160}{65216}Ooh, you're such|a cute boy.
{65220}{65241}Carmen.
{65245}{65301}- Vincent.|- Not here.
{65305}{65367}Hey, let me give you|the scoop.
{65371}{65436}See the guy with the|tie pin in his nose?
{65440}{65474}That's Moselle.
{65478}{65516}Him you|stay away from.
{65520}{65587}- No shit.|- Grow up.
{65591}{65647}He's the main stick|around here.
{65651}{65683}You beat him...
{65687}{65740}it scares away|that gentleman.
{65744}{65795}- Who's he?|- Earl.
{65799}{65864}He comes in with $6,000|in his pocket.
{65868}{65892}Jesus.
{65896}{65935}Yeah.|Runs the numbers.
{65939}{65995}Orvis says he|don't mind losing.
{65999}{66060}He just don't like|giving it away.
{66064}{66095}You beat Moselle...
{66099}{66148}old Earl there|loses interest.
{66152}{66191}What happens now?
{66195}{66240}Nothing|for a little while.
{66244}{66312}We'll play|over here.
{66316}{66396}He'll be watching you,|and he'll come to you.
{66400}{66455}Who am I|going to play?
{66459}{66480}Me.
{66484}{66515}You? Okay.
{66519}{66576}I want her|to go back.
{66580}{66604}Oh, Christ.
{66608}{66672}This place is|a damn bird land.
{66675}{66710}I've dated|worse guys.
{66714}{66768}Watch|your hands.
{66772}{66806}Okay, okay, okay.
{66810}{66889}Okay, that's enough.|That's enough. Okay.
{66893}{66920}That's enough.
{66924}{67001}Have Orvis call a cab|back to the hotel.
{67005}{67051}I don't want--|goddamn it.
{67112}{67152}Jesus Christ.
{67244}{67313}No thunderbolt breaks,|no runned over 4-balls.
{67317}{67363}Just take it easy.
{67448}{67528}She never went out|with any guys like these.
{67532}{67576}Vincent, will you|pay attention?
{67580}{67636}That guy Earl|is paying attention.
{67640}{67684}Are you listening|to me?
{67688}{67723}Yeah, yeah.
{67844}{67924}Want me to break,|or do you want to?
{67928}{67963}No. I'll break.
{68060}{68128}What did they do,|saw the legs off?
{68132}{68200}It's a table for dwarves|or something.
{68204}{68248}Oh, come on,|Fast Eddie.
{68252}{68320}Let's see some|heavy legend action here.
{68324}{68395}There's got to be|305 balls down there.
{68516}{68560}Not bad.|This ain't pool.
{68564}{68607}This is for bangers.
{68611}{68656}Straight pool|is pool.
{68660}{68703}This is like|handball...
{68707}{68752}or cribbage|or something.
{68756}{68847}Straight pool you got|to be a real surgeon...
{68851}{68895}to get it--
{68899}{68944}You know,|it's all finesse.
{68948}{69016}Now everything is 9-ball|because it's fast...
{69020}{69063}good for TV...
{69067}{69135}good for a lot|of break shots.
{69139}{69183}Oh, well.|What the hell.
{69187}{69234}Checkers sells more|than chess.
{69312}{69340}Pretty damn good.
{69344}{69423}Not bad for a blind man.|Rack 'em up.
{69427}{69510}Yes, sir. Rack 'em up|for Mr Fast Eddie.
{69514}{69556}I haven't played|serious pool...
{69560}{69603}since before|you were born...
{69607}{69675}and right away,|I'm laying them to waste.
{69679}{69740}Watch this.|9 on the break.
{69778}{69801}Ooh!
{69835}{69902}- Damn!|- All yours.
{69906}{69948}That was phenomenal.
{70021}{70063}I'd like to play|that big dude Moselle.
{70065}{70132}I bet he ain't|that good.
{70136}{70160}Yeah?
{70164}{70246}I don't know, Eddie.|Maybe you're right.
{70250}{70355}Maybe this game|is just for bangers.
{70616}{70676}Cool it.
{70680}{70779}But the thing is...
{70783}{70850}even if it is just for bangers,|everybody's doing it.
{70909}{71005}If everybody's|doing it...
{71009}{71052}There's a lot|of guys doing it.
{71120}{71194}A lot of guys|doing it...
{71433}{71512}but only one guy|can be the best.
{71672}{71719}Eddie, hey!
{71745}{71779}Hey!
{71803}{71841}Eddie.
{71888}{71945}Eddie! Eddie, what--
{71949}{71992}Where you goin'?
{71996}{72029}All right, hey.
{72033}{72077}Those were|easy shots, man.
{72081}{72113}Come on.
{72117}{72185}I'm a smart ass.|I was showing off.
{72189}{72232}I'm sorry.|All right?
{72236}{72292}This is turning|into a waste...
{72296}{72343}of my time and money.
{72432}{72484}Where are you going?
{72488}{72545}You're going to|leave me here?
{72549}{72571}What--
{72608}{72655}I don't believe|this guy!
{72948}{73010}Child care.
{73052}{73095}Eddie.
{73382}{73448}- Vincent back?|- Yeah, but he's out.
{73452}{73527}- What do you mean, out?|- Not in the room.
{73531}{73597}- Mind getting dressed?|- Why? Are we going somewhere?
{73626}{73688}What if I was|somebody else?
{73692}{73739}- Like who?|- That's not the point.
{73743}{73788}I'm not naked|or anything.
{73792}{73848}Work with me,|not against me.
{73852}{73921}Don't talk to Vincent|like you did at Chalkies.
{73925}{74028}Gets him upset.|Use that thing right.
{74032}{74084}Use what thing?
{74230}{74261}Come on.
{74265}{74308}What are you doing?
{74312}{74345}Me and you.
{74349}{74405}Quick one|before Vincent gets back.
{74409}{74442}All right? Hey.
{74446}{74513}I'm not your daddy|or your boyfriend...
{74517}{74573}so don't play games|with me.
{74577}{74609}I'm your partner.
{74613}{74658}You don't flirt|with me.
{74662}{74693}Don't flatter|yourself.
{74697}{74776}Don't waste my time|with bullshit, Carmen.
{75070}{75114}We got|a racehorse here...
{75118}{75150}a thoroughbred.
{75154}{75258}You make him feel good,|I teach him how to run.
{75262}{75309}We're businesspeople.
{75359}{75393}Got you.
{75539}{75596}Where's the Balabushka?
{75600}{75630}Vincent took it.
{75634}{75676}You said he was out.
{75680}{75723}He was in and out.
{75727}{75756}He took|the cue stick?
{75760}{75789}Yes.
{75793}{75818}You let him?
{75822}{75877}Well, so what?
{75935}{76020}Shit.
{76024}{76076}Oh, man, I'm sorry.
{76080}{76157}Jesus. Goddamn.|Child care!
{76615}{76648}Shit.
{76715}{76799}Good game.|Good game.
{76902}{76951}What you got in there?
{76955}{77016}In here?

{81331}{81417}Do I not speak your native language?|What is the matter?
{81421}{81487}You give me this stick|and tell me to lay low.
{81491}{81549}The goddamn thing, I lay it down|and it jumps up at me!
{81553}{81592}You don't deserve|this stick.
{81625}{81669}I don't deserve this?
{81709}{81753}You don't deserve|this stick.
{81757}{81825}Alls you do|is you sit in there.
{81829}{81885}You talk.|You tell me things.
{81889}{81957}I played.|I'm a fuckin' pool player.

{82125}{82153}Animal!
{82273}{82317}Vincent,|get in the car.
{82321}{82353}This is embarrassing.
{82357}{82401}You're acting|like some girl...
{82405}{82473}who got felt up|in a drive-in.
{82477}{82521}It looks terrible.
{82525}{82557}Tough shit.
{82561}{82630}How much did you|take off of Moselle?
{82634}{82666}I heard 100.
{82670}{82702}150.
{82706}{82738}150?
{82742}{82773}Yeah. 150.
{82777}{82846}Walk into a shoe store|with 150 bucks...
{82850}{82892}you leave with one shoe.
{82896}{82941}We were working|on 5,000.
{82945}{82989}Come on.
{82993}{83041}Get in. It's cold.
{83137}{83169}Vincent.
{83285}{83390}You got me|talking to myself.
{83394}{83433}Half of me says|I got a hold of...
{83437}{83472}the best thing|I ever seen.
{83476}{83564}Half of me says|it ain't worth it.
{83568}{83623}Either I don't|teach you right...
{83627}{83657}or you don't listen...
{83661}{83749}or you listen,|but you don't hear.
{83753}{83797}What was|that voodoo stuff?
{83801}{83836}That wasn't pool.|That was a circus.
{83840}{83886}You dropped your pants.
{83890}{83947}You want to get down?|Good.
{83951}{83995}You and Gypsy Rose Lee.
{83999}{84067}I can always|go back to whiskey.
{84071}{84127}It's been|very good to me.
{84131}{84199}You're sitting in it,|and I'm wearing it...
{84203}{84271}but it's tired.
{84275}{84342}You know, it's just|kind of run on.
{84346}{84426}You appear on the scene,|I'm jumping again.
{84430}{84521}You remind me that--|that money won...
{84525}{84593}is twice as sweet|as money earned.
{84597}{84690}25 years ago, I had|the screws put on me.
{84694}{84738}It was over for me...
{84742}{84785}before it really|got started.
{84789}{84833}But I'm hungry again...
{84837}{84912}and you bled that|back into me.
{84916}{85001}You got to have|two things to win.
{85005}{85050}You got to have brains...
{85054}{85109}and you got to|have balls.
{85113}{85169}You've got|too much of one...
{85173}{85231}and not enough|of the other.
{85294}{85350}I mean,|I don't know.
{85354}{85422}Tell me what|you want to do.
{85426}{85473}Give me a clue.
{85546}{85579}Uh...
{85690}{85722}Um, yeah.
{85726}{85769}I'll try.
{85773}{85817}I'll really try,|you know?
{85821}{85865}Let's go for it.
{85905}{85961}You know, Eddie,|I mean, uh...
{85965}{86033}it's just tough|for me to lay down.
{86037}{86081}You know,|it's just, uh...
{86085}{86153}I get in there,|and it's just tough.
{86157}{86237}It's just, uh,|it's just tough to lay down...
{86241}{86309}but i'll try. Okay?
{86313}{86359}Tough to lay down,|huh?
{86363}{86446}Well, roll over,|sweetheart.
{86450}{86473}Give me.
{86477}{86534}What?
{86538}{86558}90 bucks.
{86562}{86612}60% of 150|is 90 bucks.
{86843}{86875}I wake you up?
{86879}{86989}Well, do you|want to hang up?
{86993}{87074}Are you still|pissed off at me?
{87078}{87183}Well, if you were, uh,|I'd understand.
{87258}{87290}I don't know.
{87294}{87362}Uh, I'm having nightmares,|sweats, and everything.
{87366}{87430}What kind of rent|are you paying?
{87433}{87506}I said what kind of rent|do you pay?
{87545}{87577}Well, listen.
{87581}{87614}Ahem.
{87618}{87661}After the Bahamas...
{87665}{87746}maybe you could|move in with me...
{87750}{87791}just for practise.
{87845}{87889}What do you mean?
{87893}{87973}No, nothing's going on.|What are you, a shrink?
{87977}{88057}I miss you.|I say nice things to you.
{88061}{88093}Fine.
{88097}{88177}A couple of curve balls|every now and then.
{88181}{88226}They're young.|They're kids.
{88230}{88278}No, no. You're perfect.
{88375}{88436}I love this. You should have seen|Eddie play last night.
{88440}{88496}Terrific.
{88500}{88574}Are we going to make|some money today?
{88578}{88619}We'll make some money.|Definitely.
{88623}{88666}I'm a wild man today.
{88670}{88735}Did you ever hear|of a hustle...
{88739}{88796}called two brothers|and a stranger?
{88800}{88865}That's the guy|in the Bible...
{88869}{88920}with the many-coloured|coats, right?
{88924}{89004}I'm joking, you guys.|Come on.
{89008}{89066}Did I get through|to you?
{89070}{89125}I'll run it by you|another way.
{89129}{89173}If you'd have|kicked ass...
{89177}{89221}in any place|but Chalkies...
{89225}{89293}Atlantic City would|be dead for us.
{89297}{89353}The guys never|leave the street.
{89357}{89419}Otherwise, it would|be all around.
{89423}{89465}Let me tell you|something.
{89469}{89537}Last night--|people never talked to me...
{89541}{89573}Iike that before.
{89577}{89622}You really|talked to me.
{89626}{89693}I want you to know|I appreciate it.
{89697}{89790}I want to thank you|for everything. Uh...
{89956}{89989}Ahem.
{90068}{90113}Don't worry, kid.|Don't worry.
{90232}{90288}Two brothers|and a stranger.
{90292}{90391}You got two guys|who go into a bar, see?
{90495}{90538}Give me two hours.
{90542}{90610}They'll be building me|a trophy wall.
{90614}{90700}That kid gets to|have all the fun.
{90768}{90800}Lock and load.
{90965}{91008}All right.|Who's next here?
{91012}{91108}You guys want to play?|No. Anybody? Want to play?
{91112}{91143}Forget it.
{91147}{91191}Spot you|the break here.
{91195}{91264}Come on, I'll spot you|the break.
{91268}{91322}I want|the 7-ball, too.
{91326}{91406}How about the 8?|I'll give you the 8.
{91410}{91479}What do you want?|You up? Let's go.
{91615}{91671}Ha ha ha!
{92078}{92110}Ha ha ha!
{92114}{92171}Why don't you|keep it down?
{92222}{92303}What did I say?|I coughed.
{92492}{92531}Well, ya ga ga ga.
{92535}{92596}Stop it, Eddie.
{92600}{92650}Do you mind?
{92654}{92706}Excuse me?
{92710}{92762}It's a money game|here, guy.
{93054}{93086}Ha ha!
{93090}{93139}Big money game.
{93143}{93207}Right. So take your hands|off the girl...
{93211}{93257}and let us play, okay?
{93261}{93347}What do you care|where I put my hand?
{93351}{93415}Gramps, put your teeth in,|get your hands off your daughter|and pay attention.
{93418}{93452}You might learn|something today.
{93456}{93522}I'll change my teeth.|You change your goddamn diapers.
{93526}{93571}Hey, we've got|a game going here.
{93575}{93647}Really? What are you|playing for?
{93651}{93693}What's it to you?
{93697}{93737}What are you playing for?
{93741}{93784}50.
{93788}{93826}You want to win?
{93886}{93955}I'll bet 500 bucks|on this guy here.
{93959}{94006}Huh?
{94010}{94050}I think|you're a choker.
{94054}{94103}500 bucks|says you choke.
{94107}{94159}Why don't you|take a walk?
{94163}{94204}Anybody want to bet?
{94208}{94294}What are you|starting trouble for?
{94298}{94357}- I'm going to leave.|- Jerk.
{94361}{94407}Want to go|for 1,000?
{94576}{94618}I know. I mean...
{94622}{94691}you'd think|he would have seen it.
{94695}{94752}Oh, my God,|he got suckered...
{94756}{94799}into that so easy.
{94803}{94836}Unbelievable.|Unbelievable.
{94840}{94895}What's up?|What do you think?
{94899}{94943}Get in the car.
{94947}{94991}Get away from me.
{94995}{95043}What the hell|is the matter with you?
{95047}{95077}Did you have|a good time?
{95081}{95123}I'm disappointed,|frankly.
{95127}{95198}Frankly, your ass!|I seen you.
{95202}{95223}Don't give me that.
{95227}{95293}Seen what?
{95297}{95358}Screw this.|I don't need this. I'm gone.
{95362}{95420}I'm going home.|Come on.
{95424}{95456}- The hell you are.|- The hell I am?
{95460}{95540}You're going home|alone, man.
{95544}{95598}Is it you|and Eddie now?
{95602}{95629}Getting felt up|by Eddie?
{95633}{95662}Come on.
{95666}{95747}You go in that place,|you play your part.
{95751}{95820}I put my hands on her.|It's acting.
{95824}{95875}Your hands were|all over her!
{95879}{95912}It's acting!
{95916}{95948}Hey, look, Vincent...
{95952}{95996}when you go|into movies...
{96000}{96045}and you see|people kissing...
{96049}{96117}do you think|they go home together?
{96121}{96153}They're professionals.
{96157}{96201}We're trying|to be professionals.
{96444}{96526}Okay, you guys,|it was just a little rough.
{96530}{96598}I ain't used|to that, Carmen.
{96604}{96649}I don't know|about this.
{96653}{96697}Vincent the kid, huh?
{96701}{96781}You're going to be|one of the greats, kiddo.
{96785}{96872}I got a good feeling|about this.

{100432}{100468}Money.
{100504}{100569}Let's take|a stroll around.
{100615}{100690}{Y:i}A starless black sky|revealed
{100694}{100783}{Y:i}Somewhere in America
{100827}{100989}{Y:i}I can feel the tears,|all lost and alone
{101059}{101127}{Y:i}And I feel...
{101300}{101333}Hey.
{101337}{101436}Check out that guy|that's playing back there.
{101440}{101472}That guy?
{101476}{101533}Yeah. This is|a golden opportunity.
{101537}{101559}You know|who that is?
{101563}{101598}That's Grady Seasons...
{101602}{101655}the best money player|in the world.
{101659}{101740}That's Grady Seasons?|You want me to play him.
{101744}{101775}You bet.
{101779}{101836}And you are|going to dump.
{101840}{101919}You are going to|lose something fierce.
{101923}{101967}You'll ask for the spot|and the break.
{101971}{102041}It'll be humiliating.|This is beautiful.
{102045}{102113}What do you mean, dump?
{102117}{102187}If you lose bad now|to this guy...
{102191}{102258}you'll be a super nobody|in Atlantic City...
{102262}{102304}and the odds on you|will drop to nothing.
{102308}{102378}- See? She learns.|- Let me ask you.
{102382}{102438}These guys hustle,|and they win.
{102442}{102498}How come I always|got to play the jerk?
{102502}{102548}Why can't we hustle|where I win?
{102552}{102626}Because|there's something...
{102630}{102675}at the end of this.
{102679}{102734}I wouldn't|have you do it...
{102738}{102782}unless the payoff|was phenomenal.
{102786}{102855}Look, do whatever you want to do.|Do whatever you want.
{102870}{102915}I'll play.|I ask a question, he panics.
{103510}{103566}It's like a nightmare,|isn't it?
{103666}{103731}It just keeps getting|worse and worse...
{103735}{103787}Doesn't it?
{103951}{104022}{Y:i}Are you going to|fall for this?
{104067}{104132}{Y:i}We're gonna pay|hell for this
{104191}{104235}{Y:i}And now we can|move through it
{104239}{104296}Oh. The impossible dream.
{104300}{104420}{Y:i}Let ourselves|in for it...
{104945}{104970}Don't choke now.
{104974}{105062}It's not|that hard a shot.
{105066}{105134}Did you just say,|"don't choke now"?
{105138}{105170}You heard me.
{105174}{105256}Yeah. Yeah,|I heard you.
{105260}{105375}{Y:i}Let ourselves in for it
{105460}{105510}Oh!
{105514}{105566}{Y:i}Let yourself in
{105627}{105697}{Y:i}Any way that you figure it
{105701}{105759}{Y:i}It's down here|at our fingertips
{105763}{105810}{Y:i}Back again, again...
{106052}{106087}Hey, Grady.
{106091}{106155}Up your ass with the spot,|okay with you?
{106159}{106212}Fine with me.
{108192}{108283}How you doing?|Hmm?
{108287}{108347}Carmen, I'm playing|here now.
{108351}{108406}I know.
{108410}{108442}Vincent,|you win one more game...
{108446}{108504}you're gonna be humping|your fist for a long time.
{108508}{108632}You got that,|Vincent?
{108908}{108996}What are you doing,|meditating?
{109667}{109700}Yeah?
{109886}{109918}Yeah?
{109983}{110027}Can I have|the Balabushka?
{110031}{110074}Yeah.
{110114}{110171}Are you going|to play, Eddie?
{110175}{110207}Yeah, maybe.
{110211}{110242}Where?
{110246}{110290}I don't know.|Gunther's.
{110294}{110363}Are you mad at me|about last night?
{110367}{110411}No. You done good.
{110450}{110494}Where's he going?
{110498}{110543}He's going to|Gunther's, ja.
{111236}{111328}Hey, Bill.
{111332}{111411}Why don't you|call Dud?
{111415}{111507}{Y:i}Just about|to lose my mind
{111550}{111634}{Y:i}Never gonna let|your love...
{111638}{111670}Thank you.
{111708}{111775}I'll have another Drambuie|and potato salad.
{111779}{111835}Give my friend|another J.T.S. Brown.
{111839}{111869}One more time?
{111873}{111904}Absolutely.
{111908}{111952}You remind me a lot...
{111956}{112034}of a guy I played|about 20 years ago.
{112038}{112128}After that, five of us|went on a road trip...
{112132}{112164}to San Antonio.
{112168}{112211}We didn't get any action.
{112215}{112305}The windup was we ended up|playing each other.
{112309}{112400}That's all she wrote.
{112404}{112433}Nice book, though.
{112437}{112468}Buy you one?
{112472}{112515}No, I'll buy you one.
{112519}{112586}I'm going to play|for a while.
{112590}{112633}It's crazy, you know.
{112637}{112716}I was working at this job|busting my butt.
{112720}{112774}They didn't|give me a raise.
{112778}{112833}My old lady,|she leaves me...
{112837}{112892}because|she says I'm a bum...
{112896}{112928}because I quit.
{112932}{112998}Then after, I start|working at the university...
{113002}{113045}strictly|for the experience.
{113049}{113093}Guess what I was.
{113097}{113144}What were you?
{113148}{113204}I was a subject.
{113208}{113257}A what?
{113261}{113312}A subject|in the psych department.
{113316}{113380}I was a subject|for experiments--
{113384}{113439}reflexes, memory things.
{113443}{113473}I didn't do anything...
{113477}{113523}when it got|to electric shock.
{113527}{113639}I did just once,|but it don't count.
{113643}{113673}Oh!
{113867}{113899}Okay.
{113903}{113950}That's 80.
{113995}{114059}- Do it again?|- Yeah, sure, I don't care.
{114063}{114125}- Double or nothing?|- Double or nothing.
{114129}{114200}Is there an echo?
{114204}{114236}Let's play.
{114322}{114388}Eddie, how you doing?
{114392}{114474}Holding my own|and a little bit of his.
{114478}{114509}Good man.
{114513}{114546}Here.
{114572}{114599}Go!
{114603}{114626}Go!
{114630}{114650}Go!
{114654}{114713}Go! Go!|Go! Go! Go!
{114717}{114741}Fall!
{114784}{114816}Is that it?
{114867}{114899}Do it again.
{114903}{114934}Double or nothing?
{114938}{114980}What else?
