All right.
No lazy steps.

21
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:42,396
Let's go ahead and run it off.

22
00:01:42,461 --> 00:01:44,463
I want constant
fluid movement today.

23
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,432
- Is that understood?
- Yes, coach!

24
00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:47,633
And you better come

25
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,101
into every single match
with a plan,

26
00:01:49,168 --> 00:01:50,569
because you better believe
if you don't have a plan,

27
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:51,837
your rival does.

28
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:54,507
All right!

29
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:55,708
Go ahead and pair up.

00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:57,244
Find your battle buddies
right now.

31
00:01:57,311 --> 00:01:59,679
I need you to leave
everything on the mat

32
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,781
and keep it
in the circle.

33
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:04,384
Remember,
you are future holders

34
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,585
of the great machine.
Let's go!

35
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,735
Every time
you walk out this door,

36
00:02:22,802 --> 00:02:24,271
you look at that sign,

37
00:02:24,338 --> 00:02:27,240
Carpe Diem. Seize the day.

38
00:02:27,307 --> 00:02:32,144
There are no second chances.
There are no second acts.

39
00:02:32,212 --> 00:02:35,081
There is no goddamn
motherfucking second place.

40
00:02:37,217 --> 00:02:40,820
You better come in to every
single match with a plan.

41
00:02:40,886 --> 00:02:42,456
Because if you don't
have a plan,

42
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:43,589
I can tell you right now,

43
00:02:43,656 --> 00:02:45,858
your rival has a plan,

44
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:50,263
and it will manifest
itself in your defeat.

45
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,897
And you will lose.

46
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:55,134
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. And up!

47
00:02:55,202 --> 00:03:00,139
Over your heads.
Over your head. Hold it!

48
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:10,983
...five, six, seven, eight.

49
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,687
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

50
00:03:14,754 --> 00:03:18,958
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

51
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:23,029
One, two, three, four,
five, six seven, eight.

52
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:24,297
One, two...

53
00:03:24,364 --> 00:03:26,299
...cannot be taken down,

54
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:27,967
I am a new machine.

55
00:03:28,034 --> 00:03:31,971
I cannot be taken down,

<i>I am a new machine.</i>

59
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:49,456
I beat you home?
That's a first.

60
00:03:49,523 --> 00:03:51,590
Yeah. Today was
a long one.

61
00:03:51,657 --> 00:03:54,660
- Long, but good?
- Yeah.

62
00:03:54,727 --> 00:03:57,197
Mmm. I know exactly
how you feel, babe.

63
00:03:57,963 --> 00:04:00,032
- You want some food?
- Yeah.

64
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:02,335
I want what they're having.

65
00:04:02,402 --> 00:04:04,603
- It's high protein.
- Yeah.

66
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,878
- How was school?
- It was good.

67
00:04:12,945 --> 00:04:15,014
You do realize there are more
words in the English language

68
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:17,350
you can use to speak
with your father, yeah?

69
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:19,618
- School was good.
- Uh-huh.

70
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:20,820
But practice went over

71
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,154
and I have
a history test tomorrow,

72
00:04:22,222 --> 00:04:25,292
- so I need to start homework.
- Okay.

73
00:04:25,358 --> 00:04:26,625
- All right.
- There you go.

74
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:27,993
I still need you
down here by 9:00.

75
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,263
- I know.
- All right.

76
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,564
Come on. Okay now I'm gonna

77
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:38,898
- let my hands down.
- No.

78
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,301
- Come on.
- No, I don't trust myself.

79
00:05:41,368 --> 00:05:42,569
I don't trust myself.

80
00:05:42,636 --> 00:05:43,869
I don't trust myself.

81
00:05:49,775 --> 00:05:51,378
Goddess is
about to arrive.

82
00:05:51,444 --> 00:05:53,580
Don't play like you
don't want me right now.

83
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:55,848
You're obsessed
with me.

Hey, wake up.

94
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,322
- Let's go!
- Yeah, I'm up.

95
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:12,392
- Downstairs in five.
- All right.

96
00:07:15,528 --> 00:07:16,996

Go.

<i>Love is patient.
Love is kind.</i>

99
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,143
Love is not rude.
It doesn't boast.

100
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,947
Love also forgets wrong.

101
00:07:35,014 --> 00:07:38,618
If we spent more time
loving one another,

102
00:07:38,685 --> 00:07:40,152
hate would cease.

103
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,690
So you have a choice.
Love works better.

104
00:07:43,757 --> 00:07:47,227
Love is better for us.
It makes the world better,

105
00:07:47,294 --> 00:07:49,895
but we have to be in action.
How much...

106
00:07:49,962 --> 00:07:52,031
How do you want to love?
How can I love?

107
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:55,100
Well, you know what,
it could be just by a smile.

108
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:56,603
- A smile on your face could...
- A smile. Amen.

109
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,638
- ...change somebody's day.
- Yes. Amen.

110
00:07:59,838 --> 00:08:00,973
Now you choose

111
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,375
whether you use
the love correctly.

112
00:08:03,443 --> 00:08:06,713
So I want to remind you
that love is

113
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,914
a four-letter word,
and so is hate.

114
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:11,251
We're in a world full
of hate right now.

115
00:08:11,318 --> 00:08:13,253
Everybody's pointing a finger
at somebody else.

116
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,953
And you're no good.
And you're no good.

117
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,723
And we're no good.
And they're no good.

118
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,990
Ain't nobody good right now.

119
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:21,194
So we need love
to bring people back.

120
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:22,961
There used to be an old thing
when I was growing up

121
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:26,131
that says it takes a village
to raise a child.

122
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,833
<i>It's gonna take
that same village</i>

123
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,403

as a country.</i>

You get in late
last night?

127
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:47,220
Not really.

128
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:48,822
Not really, huh?
You're just falling asleep

129
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:51,558
- in church for no reason?
- No, I mean...

130
00:08:51,624 --> 00:08:53,426
Were you bored with
that service today?

131
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,229
No, I mean, it's just...

132
00:08:56,296 --> 00:08:58,498
How's your shoulder, Ty?
Still sore?

133
00:08:58,565 --> 00:09:00,433
- On and off.
- I'm gonna call Steve.

134
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,768
Just get an appointment
to make sure.

135
00:09:01,835 --> 00:09:03,168
- No, it's fine.
- He's fine.

136
00:09:03,236 --> 00:09:04,937
- You're one to talk.
- I got my eye on it.

137
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,272
You had your eye
on your knee, too.

138
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:09,108
Look where that got you.

139
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:12,245
I'm sure he's fine, but we
have a whole season ahead.

140
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:14,046
And I'm sorry again
I'm gonna miss this one,

141
00:09:14,113 --> 00:09:15,582
but your dad will be there,
and Em will be there,

142
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:17,384
- and I'll be at the next one.
- No, I can't be there either.

143
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,984
What?

144
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:21,521
I told you.
Practice got moved.

145
00:09:21,588 --> 00:09:22,921
It's your brother's
first meet.

146
00:09:22,988 --> 00:09:24,257
I have to study.

147
00:09:24,324 --> 00:09:25,625
Everybody else
can't meet that late.

148
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:27,260
And Bethany's mom says
that we can't...

149
00:09:27,327 --> 00:09:28,927
Oh,
that's what this is about.

150
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:30,797
Your friends at
Bethany's house.

151
00:09:30,864 --> 00:09:32,298
Mom, he doesn't
even care if I'm there!

152
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:33,767
- Very true.
- Do you care if I'm there?

153
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,268
No, I don't care
if you're there.

154
00:09:35,335 --> 00:09:36,503
You do care.
And you should care.

155
00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:38,338
- He doesn't.
- Okay. All right.

156
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:39,839
There's nothing to worry
about here. And you know why?

157
00:09:39,905 --> 00:09:41,140
Because the wise
and noble father

158
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:42,342
is gonna be there
to hold it down.

159
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:45,010
Really? Where is he?
Where is he?

160
00:09:45,077 --> 00:09:46,479
If you see him, will you
send him my way, please?

161
00:09:47,814 --> 00:09:49,516
Shame on you.

162
00:09:49,582 --> 00:09:51,351
If you see him,
send him my way too.

163
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:55,388
- We can go right now.
- We can go?

164
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,055
- Oh, we can go right now.
- That's what's up?

165
00:09:57,122 --> 00:09:58,491
You think you can
take your old man?

166
00:09:58,558 --> 00:09:59,592
Hold on.

167
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:00,959
You think
you can mess with this?

168
00:10:01,026 --> 00:10:02,695
- You guys.
- What's up?

169
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:04,431
- Can we not?
- What's up?

170
00:10:04,497 --> 00:10:05,799
It's that shoulder,
right? Come on.

171
00:10:05,865 --> 00:10:07,132
What's up?

172
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:11,136
- Did you start?
- Did I start?

173
00:10:11,204 --> 00:10:12,405
I'm just making sure
you started.

174
00:10:12,472 --> 00:10:13,706
- No.
- Did you?

175
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:15,875
- Dad started.
- Get out my ear.

176
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:17,310
You let me know
when you're ready.

177
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:18,812
Yeah, can you not
hit your sister?

178
00:10:20,213 --> 00:10:21,614
- You all right?
- I'm fine, man.

179
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:22,916
You let me know
when you're ready.

180
00:10:22,981 --> 00:10:24,417
You okay?

181
00:10:24,484 --> 00:10:26,386
You let me know.
You let me know.

182
00:10:26,453 --> 00:10:28,321
Can we not scare
the people, please?

183
00:10:28,388 --> 00:10:31,791
Shh. Quiet. Quiet.
Quiet. Quiet. Quiet.

184
00:10:31,858 --> 00:10:33,860
Come on!

185
00:10:33,927 --> 00:10:35,295
One more.

186
00:10:36,296 --> 00:10:37,730
- Let's go.
- One, one more.

187
00:10:37,797 --> 00:10:39,097
- One more?
- One more.

188
00:10:41,634 --> 00:10:44,537
I see you. I see you.
Come on.

189
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:48,508
What you... What you got?
What you got? Get in there.

190
00:11:01,354 --> 00:11:03,356
- You good, brah?
- I'm good.

191
00:11:03,423 --> 00:11:04,557
Flex too hard?

192
00:11:04,624 --> 00:11:06,559
You flex too hard?

193
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:17,370
You got me. You got me.
This hurts.

194
00:11:18,438 --> 00:11:20,473
<i>But it all starts
with a piece of dirt,</i>

195
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:23,610
and it turns into
something magnificent.

196
00:11:24,611 --> 00:11:25,812
Something that makes

197
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,380
a contribution
to your community.

198
00:11:28,113 --> 00:11:29,716
It's a beautiful thing.

199
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:32,986
You gotta take pride
in what you do, son.

200
00:11:33,051 --> 00:11:35,053
Never forget that.

201
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:41,728
Check this out.
Show you this master bedroom.

202
00:11:43,363 --> 00:11:45,398
If you could be
so lucky one day

203
00:11:45,465 --> 00:11:48,401
to have a bedroom
like this bedroom,

204
00:11:48,468 --> 00:11:50,203
<i>then you'd be doing all right.</i>

205
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,640
<i>You'd be doing all right.
Check it out.</i>

206
00:12:15,428 --> 00:12:17,730
You know spaghetti is
Alexis' favorite dish, right?

207
00:12:17,797 --> 00:12:19,832
You should have seen
the first time that she had it.

208
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:21,501
We got it on video, okay?

209
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:22,969
We got to find it.
I got to find it for you.

210
00:12:23,036 --> 00:12:24,637
- Dad!
- It's hilarious.

211
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:26,506
She ate it with her hands,
and it got everywhere.

212
00:12:26,573 --> 00:12:29,107
I'm talking chunks
of meat and red sauce,

213
00:12:29,174 --> 00:12:30,243
just all over the place
like a wild animal.

214
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,945
- Dad, shut up!
- So cute!

215
00:12:32,011 --> 00:12:33,513
So cute.

216
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,881
It was adorable.
It was the most lovely thing.

217
00:12:34,948 --> 00:12:36,049
Oh, my God.

218
00:12:36,114 --> 00:12:37,550
It's beautiful.
It was beautiful.

219
00:12:38,785 --> 00:12:39,852
Plus, you were so cute.

220
00:12:57,804 --> 00:12:59,137
What?

221
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:20,326
<i>Now in the eye of your mind,</i>

222
00:13:20,393 --> 00:13:21,794
<i>in your mind's eye,</i>

223
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:24,764
I want you to fixate
on your source code,

224
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:27,900
on your soul's source of pure
unadulterated inspiration.

225
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:30,803
Something that is inspiring
to you and you alone.

226
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,839
I want you to look at it.
I want you to take it in.

227
00:13:32,905 --> 00:13:36,709
I want it to be your guiding
light right now, all right?

228
00:13:36,776 --> 00:13:38,845
And then I want you to
repeat after me...

229
00:13:39,979 --> 00:13:42,115
I will not let you down.
Repeat.

230
00:13:42,181 --> 00:13:43,549
I will not
let you down.

231
00:13:43,616 --> 00:13:45,618
You will not
let me down. Repeat.

232
00:13:45,685 --> 00:13:47,320
You will not let me down.

233
00:13:47,387 --> 00:13:49,122
My folks
won't let me down.

234
00:13:49,188 --> 00:13:50,790
My folks won't let me down.

235
00:13:50,857 --> 00:13:52,525
My coach won't let me down.

236
00:13:52,592 --> 00:13:54,494
My coach won't let me down.

237
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,698
I cannot be taken down.
I am a new machine. Say it!

238
00:13:58,765 --> 00:14:00,800
I cannot be taken down.

239
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:01,934
I am a new machine.

240
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:03,403
One more time!

241
00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:05,304
I cannot be taken down.

242
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:06,773
I am a new machine.

243
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,374
One more time with me!

244
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:10,977
I cannot be taken down.
I am a new machine.

245
00:14:11,044 --> 00:14:12,578
One more time!

246
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:14,681
I cannot be taken down.
I am a new machine.

247
00:14:14,747 --> 00:14:16,015
All right,
Mavericks on three.

248
00:14:16,082 --> 00:14:17,350
One, two, three.

249
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:18,818
- Mavericks!
- Mavericks!

250
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:20,520
Mavericks!

251
00:14:20,586 --> 00:14:23,956
Mavericks! Mavericks!
Mavericks!

252
00:14:46,913 --> 00:14:48,915
One, two, three!

253
00:15:12,739 --> 00:15:14,273
- You see it?
- Yep.

254
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,942
You see it?
You feel the difference?

255
00:15:16,008 --> 00:15:17,276
Yeah, I feel the difference
all right.

256
00:15:17,343 --> 00:15:19,412
- Can you get up?
- All right. Yeah.

257
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:22,216
All right. If you did it
the way I taught you,

258
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:24,917
you would have had him
20 seconds earlier, all right?

259
00:15:24,984 --> 00:15:26,419
Get up.

260
00:15:28,688 --> 00:15:30,256
The kid was
a chump, man.

261
00:15:30,323 --> 00:15:31,758
You may have been
able to pin him quick

262
00:15:31,824 --> 00:15:33,092
because you're faster
and you're stronger,

263
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,494
but your technique...

264
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,828
Getting to State
is about technique.

265
00:15:35,895 --> 00:15:37,663
- You feel me? You good?
- Yeah. I'm good.

266
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,166
Your shoulder's good?
It's not hurting?

267
00:15:40,234 --> 00:15:41,467
- No.
- You sure?

268
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:43,669
- I'm sure.
- All right. Come on.

269
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:45,905
Let me see that fireman

Could've been better,

00:17:10,523 --> 00:17:11,824

Oh, your sister's going.

- What group is she going with?
- You think I would know?

287
00:17:22,202 --> 00:17:24,470
She just better not be going with my
ass, all right?

288
00:17:24,537 --> 00:17:27,573
- You are your sister's keeper.
- Since when?

289
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,509
It's not like it's your prom.

290
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,745
Is Alexis excited?

291
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:39,085
Yeah, I hope so. She's had
her dress for long enough.

292
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,589
- How was your day?
- Exhausting.

293
00:17:43,656 --> 00:17:44,957
Oh, that divorce
is happening.

294
00:17:45,024 --> 00:17:47,294
I have some notes
for you to do.

295
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:49,263
I keep telling her
if she'd spread her schedule out

296
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:51,764
and worked Fridays,
she wouldn't be so exhausted.

297
00:17:52,832 --> 00:17:54,467
My patients have me
until Thursday.

298
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:56,736
Come Friday I want to
be with my babies.

299

Kiss?

There's my girl.

301
00:18:04,577 --> 00:18:05,811
Good day?

302
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:08,447
Yeah. Not bad.

303
00:18:08,514 --> 00:18:11,351
- You done with your homework?
- Not yet.

304

waiting for?

00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:19,592
The usual.

309
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:23,129
- Go make your bath.
- Yes, ma'am.

310

Hey, you didn't take any

00:18:39,812 --> 00:18:41,514
attaches to the labrum.

316
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,183
That's why
you are also feeling pain

317
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,384
running up your arm.

318
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,018
Now, in your case,

319
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:48,521
if you don't remember
a specific event,

320
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:50,424
then you could have
aggravated your shoulder

321
00:18:50,489 --> 00:18:51,691
and then over time,

322
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:54,294
with repetition,
made it worse and worse.

323
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:55,928
Since it's the labrum,

324
00:18:55,995 --> 00:18:57,797
it's not just
overhead activities.

325
00:18:57,863 --> 00:19:00,400
Any strenuous activity
on the biceps tendon

326
00:19:00,466 --> 00:19:02,101
will enhance it, as well.

327
00:19:04,103 --> 00:19:07,173
Okay, um... I'm sorry.
So, like, what...

328
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,641
What does that mean?

329
00:19:09,675 --> 00:19:11,911
Well, you've done
extreme damage.

330
00:19:11,978 --> 00:19:14,314
You have a level five
out of five SLAP tear.

331
00:19:14,381 --> 00:19:18,251
I've never actually seen
this level tear in person.

332
00:19:18,318 --> 00:19:19,518
Well, I mean,
it's not that bad.

333
00:19:19,585 --> 00:19:21,288
I could easily
push through it.

334
00:19:21,355 --> 00:19:23,823
I'm afraid you need surgery
or you're running the risk of

335
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:26,926
permanent, irreversible,
damage.

336
00:19:26,993 --> 00:19:28,594
But I'm...
But I'm in season right now, so...

337
00:19:28,661 --> 00:19:32,432
I understand. But Tyler,
this is very serious.

338
00:19:32,498 --> 00:19:33,799
I highly recommend you stop

339
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:35,534
all physical activity
immediately

340
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:36,969
and we get you surgery
as soon as possible.

341
00:19:37,036 --> 00:19:39,972
Wait, what if...
What if we did it, um...

342
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,408
What if we did it
at the end of season

343
00:19:41,475 --> 00:19:42,541
and I could, you know,

344
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:43,943
I could recover
over the summer?

345
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,678
And I could be ready
for next year for college?

346
00:19:45,745 --> 00:19:47,780
I can't see you
making another match,

347
00:19:47,847 --> 00:19:50,417
let alone
an entire season.

348
00:19:50,484 --> 00:19:53,152
Then, to be honest,
recovery would take much longer

349
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,820
than just the summer.

350
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:57,690
You're likely never to fully
recover to the way you were,

351
00:19:57,757 --> 00:20:00,026
but the sooner we address
this, the better.

352
00:20:01,194 --> 00:20:06,233
You're young
and you'll heal very well.

353
00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:09,101
It's going
to take time.

354
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,072
<i>I can call your mom if you...</i>

355
00:20:14,907 --> 00:20:16,343
<i>No,
you don't have to do that.</i>

356
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,111
<i>I'll... I'll talk to her.</i>

357
00:20:20,613 --> 00:20:22,982
<i>I'm very sorry, Tyler.</i>

358
00:20:30,524 --> 00:20:32,725
That's one bottle of vodka.

359
00:20:36,263 --> 00:20:37,630
There you go.

360
00:20:38,532 --> 00:20:40,733
- You got it, bud?
- Yeah.

361
00:22:10,423 --> 00:22:13,226
Ty, there's water
coming through my door!

362
00:22:13,293 --> 00:22:15,794
Ty, there's water everywhere.
What are you doing?

363
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,366
Tyler?

364
00:22:23,702 --> 00:22:25,905
Geez. Every practice.

365
00:22:49,329 --> 00:22:50,729
Don't be a pussy.

366
00:22:50,796 --> 00:22:52,365
Let him up!

367
00:22:57,102 --> 00:22:58,971
<i>What's the matter, Ty?</i>

368
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:02,342
Let's do this.
I'm right here with you. Come on.

369
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,810
Go.

370
00:23:04,877 --> 00:23:07,414
Come on. One.

371
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,417
Two.

372
00:23:11,184 --> 00:23:12,419
Three.

373
00:23:13,386 --> 00:23:14,753
Four.

374
00:23:15,522 --> 00:23:17,089
Five.

375
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:19,426
Six. Come on.

376
00:23:20,092 --> 00:23:21,428
Seven.

377
00:23:22,195 --> 00:23:25,498
Eight. Two more.

378
00:23:25,565 --> 00:23:28,767
One more, baby.

379
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:30,035
How you doing?

380
00:23:31,705 --> 00:23:33,072
- You done now?
- Yeah, I'm good.

381
00:23:33,138 --> 00:23:34,641
- That's it?
- I'm done.

382
00:23:36,476 --> 00:23:38,411
<i>...broke down in tears today,</i>

383
00:23:38,478 --> 00:23:40,846
<i>and Linda continues to refuse
any type of communication.</i>

384
00:23:47,987 --> 00:23:50,457
- How's it coming?
- Good.

385
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:55,262
- How many more you got?
- Halfway.

386
00:23:55,328 --> 00:23:57,697
What's this format?
Why's the date over there?

387
00:23:57,796 --> 00:23:59,232
It's the format
she told me to do.

388
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:00,600
Can you just let me
do my thing?

389
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:01,767
I don't pay you
to do your thing.

390
00:24:01,834 --> 00:24:03,603
I pay you to do my thing.

391
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,872
- Technically she pays me.
- You know, there you go again.

392
00:24:06,939 --> 00:24:09,108
- What's that attitude about?
- What do you mean?

393
00:24:09,174 --> 00:24:11,877
You know exactly what I mean.
Hey, stop!

394
00:24:11,944 --> 00:24:14,146
Turn it off and look at me.

395
00:24:20,687 --> 00:24:22,154
Look around here for a sec.

396
00:24:24,023 --> 00:24:27,092
Who do you think
keeps all this running, hmm?

397
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:28,695
Now, your mother may be
great with the patients,

398
00:24:28,762 --> 00:24:31,163
but she don't know nothing
about running a business.

399
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,500
You think if I quit my job

400
00:24:33,566 --> 00:24:35,268
and stopped running
your mother's business,

401
00:24:35,335 --> 00:24:36,869
that you'd have a place
to even

402
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:39,972
lay that big head
of yours? Huh?

403
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:41,508
- No.
- Then what's up?

404
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,646
I mean, I just have a lot
going on right now.

405
00:24:46,713 --> 00:24:48,847
Do you really? What,
you think me and your mom

406
00:24:48,914 --> 00:24:50,417
don't got a lot going on?

407
00:24:50,483 --> 00:24:52,719
Wait until you get out
on your own in the world

408
00:24:52,786 --> 00:24:54,387
and have
real responsibilities.

409
00:24:55,588 --> 00:24:57,590
You got to be able
to balance it, Ty.

410
00:24:58,525 --> 00:25:01,261
Now, we talked
about this, brah.

411
00:25:01,328 --> 00:25:03,162
If you can't keep it going,
you can forget about

412
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:04,798
hanging out with your friends
or running around

413
00:25:04,897 --> 00:25:06,299
with that little
girl of yours. You...

414
00:25:06,366 --> 00:25:08,401
Quit shaking your head
at me, boy.

415
00:25:09,336 --> 00:25:11,937
This is my house.
If you don't like the way

416
00:25:12,004 --> 00:25:13,906
I run things,
then you can be up out.

417
00:25:15,575 --> 00:25:18,712
I told you you didn't
have to work for me

418
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:20,513
and you didn't
have to train with me.

419
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,416
You asked for that.
That was your choice, right?

420
00:25:23,483 --> 00:25:25,352
And I'm not the one
who chose wrestling,

421
00:25:25,418 --> 00:25:26,820
but if you're gonna
do something,

422
00:25:26,885 --> 00:25:28,954
you might as well
do it right.

423
00:25:29,021 --> 00:25:30,390
I said it before,
I'll say it again.

424
00:25:30,457 --> 00:25:35,060
The world don't give a shit
about you or me.

425
00:25:35,127 --> 00:25:39,399
We are not afforded
the luxury of being average.

426
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:43,636
Got to work 10 times as hard
just to get anywhere.

427
00:25:44,903 --> 00:25:46,272
It's...

428
00:25:50,377 --> 00:25:53,179
Ty, I don't push you
because I want to.

429
00:25:53,246 --> 00:25:55,281
I push you because
I have to.

430
00:25:55,348 --> 00:25:57,250
Do you hear
what I'm saying, son?

431
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,990
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Yeah. Yeah.

432
00:26:07,293 --> 00:26:08,595
Good.

433
00:26:11,331 --> 00:26:12,332
Good.

434
00:26:16,068 --> 00:26:18,571
Man, I look at y'all
sometimes and think of

435
00:26:18,638 --> 00:26:21,341
all the opportunities
you have that I didn't.

436
00:26:22,275 --> 00:26:25,110
Wishing Nana and
Three Papa had done for me.

437
00:26:26,145 --> 00:26:27,946
You don't know
how good you got it.

438
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,135
Pin! Pin!

439
00:26:56,509 --> 00:26:57,911
Get him, Ty!

440
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:11,391
Pin him down!
Pin him down!

441
00:27:42,154 --> 00:27:43,756
- Yes! Go, Tyler!
- Come on, Ty!

442
00:27:43,823 --> 00:27:47,427
Let's go! Let's go!

443
00:27:47,494 --> 00:27:50,128
- Single leg. Single leg.
- Yeah!

444
00:27:53,566 --> 00:27:54,801
Get his
shoulder down, Ty!

445
00:27:54,868 --> 00:27:56,068
Get his shoulder down.

446
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:58,170
Come on.
Come on, Tyler!

447
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:03,810
Can't let him work
like that, Ty! Come on!

448
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:08,113
Come on, babe!
Get up! Get up!

449
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,080
Match. Dragon win.

450
00:28:42,147 --> 00:28:44,082
Get up!

451
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:45,485
It's all right, Tyler!

452
00:28:46,853 --> 00:28:48,086
Good job!

453
00:28:49,822 --> 00:28:53,226
It's okay!
It's all right, babe!

454
00:28:55,828 --> 00:28:57,497
It's all right!

455
00:28:57,564 --> 00:28:59,365
Let's go, Williams!

456
00:28:59,432 --> 00:29:01,099
- Let's go!
- You can do better.

457
00:29:01,968 --> 00:29:03,303
You can do better.

458
00:29:03,369 --> 00:29:05,170
Let's do this, Tyler!

459
00:29:08,173 --> 00:29:10,643
Come on now, Tyler!

460
00:29:11,778 --> 00:29:13,212
Come on now, Tyler!

461
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,415
Come on, Ty!
Come on, you got this!

462
00:29:29,462 --> 00:29:33,866
Get up, Tyler!
Get up, babe!

463
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,607
Roll out!

464
00:29:40,673 --> 00:29:43,141
Spring out!
Spring out!

465
00:29:44,477 --> 00:29:46,412
It's okay.
It's okay.

466
00:29:59,892 --> 00:30:02,795
Calm down.
It's all right. It's all right.

467
00:31:12,031 --> 00:31:15,168
He did this to himself
through sheer stupidity!

468
00:31:15,234 --> 00:31:18,471
Watch your voice.
Steve should've told us.

469
00:31:19,806 --> 00:31:21,674
So much
for a scholarship.

470
00:31:21,741 --> 00:31:23,509
I don't know what
the hell he was thinking.

471
00:31:23,576 --> 00:31:25,545
Steve said
he didn't call

472
00:31:25,611 --> 00:31:27,513
because Tyler wanted
to tell us personally.

473
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,049
So he's been lying
to us this whole time?

474
00:31:30,116 --> 00:31:32,051
It's his attitude,
I'm telling you. The boy...

475
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:48,534
<i>♪♪ Gonna be somebody,
oh I follow</i>

476
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:51,871

- <i>♪♪ Running showers and the mist so fly</i>

477
00:31:51,938 --> 00:31:54,741
I feel like I haven't
seen you in forever.

478
00:31:54,807 --> 00:31:57,477
I feel the same way.

479
00:31:57,543 --> 00:32:02,348
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

480
00:32:03,883 --> 00:32:06,452
Your callouses are
getting better, at least.

481
00:32:08,387 --> 00:32:10,556
Yeah, that's because
I haven't been lifting.

482
00:32:10,623 --> 00:32:13,726
Oh, right. Shit. Sorry.

483
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,712
I'm not really in the mood
right now.

484
00:32:33,379 --> 00:32:34,714
Why not? I mean, it's...

485
00:32:36,183 --> 00:32:40,553
Baby, it's been forever.
I mean...

486
00:32:43,523 --> 00:32:45,591
I know you're under
a lot of pressure right now,

487
00:32:45,658 --> 00:32:48,728
but I'm just getting
really scared.

488
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,099
About what? What's going on?
Are you okay?

489
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,569
I still haven't gotten
my period.

490
00:32:57,804 --> 00:32:58,938
What?

491
00:32:59,005 --> 00:33:03,075
It's been like two,
three weeks.

492
00:33:03,142 --> 00:33:06,479
I don't know. I'm just...

493
00:33:06,546 --> 00:33:08,481
I have nobody
to talk to about it

494
00:33:08,548 --> 00:33:09,816
and I'm just getting
really scared.

495
00:33:09,882 --> 00:33:12,084
Don't be...
Don't be scared.

496
00:33:12,151 --> 00:33:15,621
First of all, you can
always talk to me.

497
00:33:15,688 --> 00:33:19,959
All right?
Look, you can always talk to me.

498
00:33:20,026 --> 00:33:22,361
We're in this together.

499
00:33:22,428 --> 00:33:23,896
I don't want you
to ever feel like

500
00:33:23,963 --> 00:33:25,464
you should be scared
or anything like that.

501
00:33:25,531 --> 00:33:27,733
Look at me. Babe, look at me.

502
00:33:31,137 --> 00:33:34,440
Everything's going
to be okay, all right?

503
00:33:37,543 --> 00:33:39,779
All right?

504
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,451
Yeah.

505
00:33:49,256 --> 00:33:50,656

512
00:34:26,226 --> 00:34:28,828
I think this is it.

00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:31,964
Yeah?

514
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,836
- Fucking assholes.
- Just don't look at them.

515
00:34:38,638 --> 00:34:40,573
Why do they
have to do that?

516
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,774
Do what?

517
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:43,542
You want me to
drop you off here?

518
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:45,379
- Drop me off?
- I mean, where do you...

519
00:34:45,444 --> 00:34:47,314
What else
do you want me to do?

520
00:34:47,381 --> 00:34:49,182
Are you kidding? Just find...
Get parking. Just park.

521
00:34:53,387 --> 00:34:55,588
- Right here cool?
- Yeah, it's fine.

522
00:34:55,655 --> 00:34:57,523
You know
you're going to go to hell!

523
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,095
- Don't be a murderer!
- Thou shalt not kill!

524
00:35:10,836 --> 00:35:12,805
All right, let me have
everybody's attention.

525
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:15,541
All right.

526
00:35:15,608 --> 00:35:18,144
Look, these people
out here are crazy, man.

527
00:35:18,211 --> 00:35:21,847
And these women, they carry
guns on them. I seen it.

528
00:35:23,549 --> 00:35:25,484
All right, I also seen them
try to convince

529
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:27,820
a young woman not to
go through the procedure,

530
00:35:27,887 --> 00:35:31,425
because they promised her
to adopt her child.

531
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:34,361
And guess what?
They didn't.

532
00:35:34,428 --> 00:35:35,861
Didn't help her out at all.

533
00:35:35,928 --> 00:35:37,830
And guess what?
She's stuck.

534
00:35:39,665 --> 00:35:41,701
They tell people
the worst things

535
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:43,270
every single day
and I got to take it.

536
00:35:43,337 --> 00:35:45,838
But listen, I'm here
for y'all, all right?

537
00:35:45,905 --> 00:35:47,506
But all I ask in return

538
00:35:47,573 --> 00:35:48,908
is that you're here
for me as well.

539
00:35:49,508 --> 00:35:51,143
So please,

540
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:53,380
do not go out here and mess
with these crazy women.

541
00:35:53,447 --> 00:35:55,715
Okay? All right.

542
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:57,984
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

543
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:14,133
Can we go? Just...
Can we please leave?

544
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:15,202
Yeah.

545
00:36:16,702 --> 00:36:18,070
You all right?

546
00:36:18,137 --> 00:36:20,374
I just want
to get out of here.

547
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,675
You'll go to hell
for what you've done! Murderer!

548
00:36:22,742 --> 00:36:24,344
- Thou shalt not kill!
- Hey!

549
00:36:24,411 --> 00:36:25,644
Leave them alone!

550
00:36:25,711 --> 00:36:26,946
- Nigger!
- What?

551
00:36:27,013 --> 00:36:28,448
- I said "Nigger!"
- What the fuck

552
00:36:28,514 --> 00:36:29,749
- you just say to me?
- I said "Nigger!"

553
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:31,117
Don't fucking say
shit like that!

554
00:36:31,184 --> 00:36:32,818
- You can't say that, bitch!
- I said "Nigger!"

555
00:36:32,885 --> 00:36:34,120
No, get in the car, Alexis!
Get in the car!

556
00:36:34,187 --> 00:36:35,788
Don't be saying shit like...
You racist!

557
00:36:35,855 --> 00:36:37,224
- Go!
- Get in the car! Come on.

558
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:38,291
- Let's go!
- Nigger!

559
00:36:38,358 --> 00:36:39,625
Fuck you, bitch!

560
00:36:49,902 --> 00:36:51,737
I'm sorry. You shouldn't have
had to see that. I'm sorry.

561
00:37:02,182 --> 00:37:04,884
You okay? What happened?

562
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:07,787
I couldn't do it.

563
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:09,489
- What?
- I couldn't do it.

564
00:37:10,956 --> 00:37:12,259
What do... What do you mean
you couldn't do it?

565
00:37:12,325 --> 00:37:13,993
I don't...
I don't know.

566
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,529
- I just... I don't know.
- Babe, why didn't you just

567
00:37:15,594 --> 00:37:16,929
do it while we were there?
We could've did it

568
00:37:16,996 --> 00:37:18,498
- while we were at... We...
- I'm just confused.

569
00:37:18,564 --> 00:37:19,832
- I'm just confused.
- I don't have to go...

570
00:37:19,899 --> 00:37:20,933
- Confused about what?
- We need to talk

571
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,134
- about it again.
- Talk about what?

572
00:37:22,202 --> 00:37:23,869
We need to just
talk about it again.

573
00:37:23,936 --> 00:37:24,904
We talked about it! What more
is there to talk about?

574
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:26,373
Why are you yelling at me?

575
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,008
- I'm not yelling at you.
- You're yelling at me.

576
00:37:29,075 --> 00:37:31,143
- I'm not yelling at you!
- Yes, you are!

577
00:37:31,211 --> 00:37:32,479
No, I'm not!

578
00:37:32,546 --> 00:37:35,348
God.

579
00:37:37,917 --> 00:37:39,852
All right, whatever.
I'm sorry.

580
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:41,188
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
- You don't understand how hard this is.

581
00:37:41,254 --> 00:37:43,823
- It's my body.
- I get it's your body.

582
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:45,591
- Relax! You...
- No, you don't get it.

583
00:37:45,658 --> 00:37:47,626
You don't get it.
And I... You...

584
00:37:47,693 --> 00:37:49,595
I don't know
if I can do an abortion.

585
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,232
What the fuck are you
talking about?

586
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:55,968
- Huh?
- I don't know if I can do it.

587
00:37:56,035 --> 00:37:57,337
What do you...

588
00:37:57,404 --> 00:37:58,838
Stop crying! What do you mean
you can't get an abortion?

589
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:00,906
Fuck you! Don't tell me
to stop crying!

590
00:38:00,973 --> 00:38:03,742
This is my body and you have
no idea what it's like!

591
00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:05,744
I get it's your body!
I know! Whatever.

592
00:38:05,811 --> 00:38:07,280
We're seniors
in high school!

593
00:38:07,347 --> 00:38:09,516
We shouldn't be fucking
having a baby right now. Like...

594
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:10,816
Yeah, that's your
point of view!

595
00:38:10,883 --> 00:38:13,186
Thank you for
caring about mine.

596
00:38:13,253 --> 00:38:15,121
- Why would I care about an...
- What is wrong with you?

597
00:38:15,188 --> 00:38:16,922
- What is wrong with you?
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

598
00:38:16,989 --> 00:38:18,325
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

599
00:38:19,658 --> 00:38:21,294
- Stupid. God.
- Stupid what?

600
00:38:21,361 --> 00:38:23,296
- Stupid ass bitch! What the fuck...
- Stop the fucking car!

601
00:38:23,363 --> 00:38:24,930
- ...are you talking about? I'll stop the fucking car!
- Fuck you!

602
00:38:24,997 --> 00:38:26,233
- Stop the fucking car.
- Get out the fucking car

603
00:38:26,299 --> 00:38:27,967
if you wanna get out
the fucking car! Ow!

604
00:38:28,033 --> 00:38:29,369
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Fuck you!

605
00:38:30,504 --> 00:38:32,104
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

606
00:38:32,171 --> 00:38:33,306
Fuck you!

607
00:38:33,373 --> 00:38:34,673
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

608
00:38:40,247 --> 00:38:41,747
You're just going to fucking

609
00:38:41,814 --> 00:38:43,283
walk out of the fucking car
like that?

610
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,850
Yeah, I'm going to walk
out of the fucking car!

611
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:46,386
- Why the fuck...
- Leave me the fuck alone!

612
00:38:46,453 --> 00:38:48,120
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

613
00:38:52,592 --> 00:38:53,759
Come on, Lex! Lex!

614
00:38:53,826 --> 00:38:55,262
I can't... I...

615
00:38:55,328 --> 00:38:56,996
I can't just leave you
out here! Just get...

616
00:38:57,062 --> 00:38:58,797
- Just get in the car, Alexis!
- Just leave! Just leave!

617
00:38:58,864 --> 00:39:00,166
- Just get in the car!
- Leave me alone!

618
00:39:00,233 --> 00:39:01,934
I'll take you
fucking home and...

619
00:39:02,001 --> 00:39:03,570
- It doesn't even make sense!
- No, just leave me alone!

620
00:39:03,637 --> 00:39:04,904
Just go!

621
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:06,872
Whatever, brah.

622
00:39:06,939 --> 00:39:09,041
You want to walk?
Whatever. Fucking walk then!

623
00:39:09,108 --> 00:39:10,243
Bye!

624
00:39:11,844 --> 00:39:13,045
How she going...

625
00:39:14,381 --> 00:39:15,681
Fuck.

01:03:26,332 --> 01:03:27,734
I care about nobody but my fucking self, right now?

936
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,235
Don't fucking
walk away from me!

937
01:03:29,302 --> 01:03:30,403
- Fuck you! Move!
- Listen. Listen.

938
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:31,804
Look, we can keep it, Alexis.

939
01:03:31,871 --> 01:03:34,273
Alexis, Lex.
Look at... Look at me.

940
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:36,109
Look at me. Look at me.
We can fucking keep it.

941
01:03:36,174 --> 01:03:38,645
We can keep it. We don't have
to get a fucking abortion.

942
01:03:38,711 --> 01:03:41,981
Fuck you! You think I'm gonna
raise my baby with you?

943
01:03:42,048 --> 01:03:43,316
Look at you!

944
01:03:43,383 --> 01:03:45,251
What you mean, "Look at me"?

945
01:03:45,318 --> 01:03:47,420
I'm here for you, bitch!
I'm fucking here for...

946
01:03:47,487 --> 01:03:49,288
- Stop calling me a bitch!
- You fucking him...

947
01:03:49,355 --> 01:03:50,757
- Go fuck yourself!
- You stupid ass bitch!

948
01:03:50,823 --> 01:03:52,191
Stupid ass bitch!
Fucking walk away from me.

949
01:03:52,258 --> 01:03:53,660
- Fuck you!
- You go to the fucking

950
01:03:53,726 --> 01:03:54,827
abortion clinic

951
01:03:54,894 --> 01:03:55,995
and you're getting rid
of that shit!

952
01:03:56,062 --> 01:03:57,463
Fuck you!

953
01:04:56,456 --> 01:05:01,661
I'm sorry, Alexis.
I'm sorry, Alexis.

954
01:05:02,795 --> 01:05:04,931
I'm sorry, Alexis.

955
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:15,842
Come on. Wake up.

956
01:05:17,376 --> 01:05:19,779
Wake up. Come on.
Come...

957
01:05:19,846 --> 01:05:22,148
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

958
01:05:24,917 --> 01:05:26,786
What did I do?

959
01:05:26,853 --> 01:05:28,755
I'm sorry. Come on.

960
01:05:43,703 --> 01:05:45,705
What happened?
Who is that?

961
01:05:45,772 --> 01:05:47,507
- It's Alexis.
- Call the cops!

962
01:05:47,573 --> 01:05:49,176
- Oh, my God.
- No freaking way.

963
01:05:49,243 --> 01:05:50,643
Oh, my God!

964
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:51,978
- Whoa...
- Is she dead?

965
01:06:12,465 --> 01:06:13,933
I don't know the address.

966
01:06:16,702 --> 01:06:18,437
- She's lying there...
- Did somebody...

967
01:06:18,504 --> 01:06:21,007
- Did somebody call 911?
- ...and she's bleeding.

968
01:06:21,073 --> 01:06:22,642
There's blood near her head.

969
01:07:36,949 --> 01:07:37,950
Hello?

970
01:07:39,085 --> 01:07:40,386
Who is it?

971
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:56,035
Are you okay?

972
01:07:56,102 --> 01:07:57,637
- Are you okay?
- Uh-huh.

973
01:07:57,703 --> 01:08:02,808
Okay. You seen your brother?
Has Tyler been here?

974
01:08:02,875 --> 01:08:05,978
Hey, Em.
Has Tyler been here?

975
01:08:06,045 --> 01:08:09,515
Tyler.
What's going on with you?

976
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:12,185
Talk to me!

977
01:08:15,721 --> 01:08:17,690
What is going on, Tyler?

978
01:08:34,207 --> 01:08:36,142
Open the fucking door, Tyler!

979
01:08:37,076 --> 01:08:38,878
Open the fucking door!

980
01:08:38,945 --> 01:08:40,813
You're scaring me!

981
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,682
What did you do?
Open the door!

982
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:52,792
<i>Open the door!</i>

983
01:08:55,094 --> 01:08:56,296
Where are you going?

984
01:08:56,829 --> 01:08:58,164
Where are you going?

985
01:08:58,231 --> 01:09:01,234
Stop walking when
I'm talking to you!

986
01:09:01,301 --> 01:09:02,302
Tyler, stop!

987
01:09:13,145 --> 01:09:14,381
Young female,
blunt force trauma to head.

988
01:09:25,758 --> 01:09:28,794
Freeze! Right now!
Get on your knees!

989
01:09:28,861 --> 01:09:30,596
Put your hands
behind your back, now!

990
01:09:31,897 --> 01:09:34,834
Huh? Was that his girlfriend?

991
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:37,136
Was that his girlfriend
in the ambulance?

992
01:09:38,137 --> 01:09:40,840
It was? Yeah?

993
01:09:40,906 --> 01:09:42,808
But you don't know
what happened?

994
01:09:44,643 --> 01:09:46,213
Was he here?

995
01:09:49,216 --> 01:09:50,750
Was he here?

996

<i>This is State of
Florida vs. Tyler Williams.</i>

997
01:13:49,989 --> 01:13:52,259
Mister Williams,
will you please stand?

998
01:13:58,298 --> 01:14:02,335
Tyler Williams, for your
conviction of the crime of

999
01:14:02,402 --> 01:14:07,474
murder in the second degree,
upon your plea of guilty,

1000
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:09,409
it is the order of this
court that you be sentenced

1001
01:14:09,476 --> 01:14:12,579
to the State Correctional
Institution of Miami

1002
01:14:12,646 --> 01:14:15,248
for the rest
of your natural life.

1003
01:14:16,316 --> 01:14:17,950
Consistent with
the requirements

1004
01:14:18,017 --> 01:14:20,654
of the Florida Constitution,

1005
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:23,989
this sentence is
technically with mercy,

1006
01:14:24,056 --> 01:14:25,891
which makes you
eligible for parole

1007
01:14:25,958 --> 01:14:28,261
after you have served
30 years.

1008
01:16:07,494 --> 01:16:09,462
This is your last
shot of this. All right?

1009
01:16:09,529 --> 01:16:12,599
Sign up for the tournament,
get those credits in.

1010
01:16:12,665 --> 01:16:14,032
Don't embarrass your parents.

1011
01:16:14,099 --> 01:16:15,235
You're not gonna go home

1012
01:16:15,301 --> 01:16:17,670
and forget everything
I taught you?

1013
01:16:17,737 --> 01:16:20,072
I'm going to miss you all.
It's been a great year.

1014
01:16:26,111 --> 01:16:27,380
Hey. Sorry.

1015
01:18:48,053 --> 01:18:50,122
Hey. Hello?

1016
01:18:50,189 --> 01:18:52,392
Hi. Sorry, I...
I don't mean to bother you.

1017
01:18:52,458 --> 01:18:55,662
Did I, um... Did I bump
into you the other day?

1018
01:18:56,161 --> 01:18:57,997
What?

1019
01:18:58,063 --> 01:18:59,599
Did I bump into you earlier?

1020
01:19:00,767 --> 01:19:03,469
Uh, yeah, outside
Mr. Stanley's fifth period?

1021
01:19:03,536 --> 01:19:05,038
Oh, yeah, it's fine.
It's cool.

1022
01:19:05,103 --> 01:19:06,472
I'm so sorry about that.

1023
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:08,675
Um...

1024
01:19:08,741 --> 01:19:11,109
Uh... Sorry to have
bothered you too.

1025
01:19:11,177 --> 01:19:13,379
Um, are you here
to judge or...

1026
01:19:15,348 --> 01:19:17,350
- The lip sync final?
- Yeah.

1027
01:19:17,417 --> 01:19:18,651
Mmm-hmm.

1028
01:19:18,718 --> 01:19:20,253
Nice. Yeah, I'm just doing
the improv final.

1029
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,322
I just put it off, uh,

1030
01:19:22,388 --> 01:19:24,223
all semester,
so now here I am.

1031
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:29,295
What... Do you have a lot
left today or is it just this?

1032
01:19:29,362 --> 01:19:33,366
- Just the lip sync final.
- Nice. Yes, nice. Nice, nice.

1033
01:19:33,433 --> 01:19:34,701
Same for me. I'm just...

1034
01:19:34,767 --> 01:19:37,337
Got this one left
and then I'm done.

Um...

1036

Total shot in the dark. Uh...
Would you maybe want to, like,

1037
01:19:46,679 --> 01:19:49,582
grake something to
eat with me later?

1038
01:19:50,115 --> 01:19:52,051
What?

1039
01:19:52,117 --> 01:19:54,654
"Grake something"?
What did you just say?

1040
01:19:54,721 --> 01:19:57,256
Would you maybe want to
grab something

1041
01:19:57,323 --> 01:19:58,891
to eat with me later?

1042
01:19:59,525 --> 01:20:00,593
Um...

1043
01:20:01,928 --> 01:20:04,263
Um... Sure.

1044
01:20:05,163 --> 01:20:07,165
Awesome. Uh...

1045
01:20:07,233 --> 01:20:08,468
- Where?
- I don't know.

1046
01:20:08,534 --> 01:20:10,203
Where do you want to eat?

1047
01:20:10,837 --> 01:20:12,205
Um...

1048
01:20:13,806 --> 01:20:16,809
There's a diner down the
street that we could go to.

1049
01:20:16,876 --> 01:20:18,211
Great.

1050
01:20:19,379 --> 01:20:20,847
- Cool.
- Awesome.

1051
01:20:20,913 --> 01:20:23,316

- Emily.

1053
01:20:25,918 --> 01:20:29,489
Okay.
When do you get out?

1054
01:20:30,723 --> 01:20:32,025
Um...

1055
01:20:32,091 --> 01:20:35,495
I don't... I'm not completely sure yet.
I don't know.

1056
01:20:35,561 --> 01:20:37,897
- Okay.
- But before 3:00, I guess.

1057
01:20:37,964 --> 01:20:41,968
Okay, well, I'll, uh...
Then when I get out,

1058
01:20:42,035 --> 01:20:45,371
I'll just come wait outside
here and we can go.

1059
01:20:47,774 --> 01:20:50,443
Yeah. Do you want
one of these?

1060
01:20:52,779 --> 01:20:54,447
Um...

1061
01:20:54,514 --> 01:20:57,750
I don't know what flavor it is.
Blue raspberry.

1062

There you go. All right,
I'll see you later.

I'm not gonna lie.

1064
01:21:45,665 --> 01:21:47,667
I actually didn't think
you were going to show up.

1065
01:21:48,334 --> 01:21:49,802
- Really?
- No.

Why?

1067
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:54,240
Um... I don't know.
I've just never...

1068
01:21:54,307 --> 01:21:57,844
I've never asked somebody
to hang out like that before.

1069
01:21:59,112 --> 01:22:01,147
Someone...
Someone like you.

1070
01:22:01,215 --> 01:22:04,984
Like me? I don't...
What does that mean?

1071
01:22:05,051 --> 01:22:08,354
No, it doesn't mean...
You're just really beautiful.

1072
01:22:08,788 --> 01:22:10,556
And, uh...

1073

01:23:19,892 --> 01:23:22,829
No, I don't know anybody
on my dad's side really.

1093
01:23:25,731 --> 01:23:27,600
Do you want to, um...

1094
01:23:27,667 --> 01:23:28,868
Do you want to split a burger?

1095
01:23:29,702 --> 01:23:31,037
Um...

1096
01:23:31,103 --> 01:23:34,040
I'm eating burgers at
breakfast, lunch and dinner

1097
01:23:34,106 --> 01:23:35,309
since the season ended.

1098
01:23:35,374 --> 01:23:37,244
Right. You're in wrestling?

1099
01:23:37,311 --> 01:23:40,346
Yes, I am.
How did you know that?

1100
01:23:40,413 --> 01:23:44,517
Well, I may have
Insta-stalked you

1101
01:23:44,584 --> 01:23:49,155
- after the lip sync final.
- Really? Oh, nice!

1102
01:23:49,223 --> 01:23:50,656
And maybe Twitter.

1103
01:23:50,723 --> 01:23:52,326
I'm not...
I'm actually...

1104
01:23:52,391 --> 01:23:54,160
I actually am not gonna lie,
I did the same thing to you,

1105
01:23:54,228 --> 01:23:55,695
but I couldn't find anything.

1106
01:23:55,761 --> 01:23:58,497
- Yeah, I deleted everything.
- Why?

1107
01:23:58,965 --> 01:24:00,099
Um...

1108
01:24:00,833 --> 01:24:02,368
I don't know.
Why do you think?

1109
01:24:02,435 --> 01:24:04,403
I don't know.
That's why I asked.

1110
01:24:07,207 --> 01:24:08,841
Um... You know

1111
01:24:08,908 --> 01:24:10,877
- who my brother is, right?
- Yes.

1112
01:24:11,978 --> 01:24:16,015
Well, people would just, uh...

1113
01:24:16,082 --> 01:24:19,652
Just send me really horrible
messages all the time.

1114
01:24:19,719 --> 01:24:22,555
Oh, fuck.

1115
01:24:23,522 --> 01:24:25,458
Terrible, so...

1116
01:24:25,958 --> 01:24:27,493
I'm sorry.

1117
01:24:31,731 --> 01:24:34,667
You know,
people can be such assholes.

1118
01:24:40,606 --> 01:24:41,941
Fuck 'em.

1119
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:45,912
Fuck 'em.

1120
01:24:48,014 --> 01:24:49,216
Fuck 'em.

1121
01:24:49,283 --> 01:24:51,251
- Fuck 'em good.
- Fuck 'em good.

1122
01:25:08,167 --> 01:25:09,635
Okay.

1123
01:26:18,637 --> 01:26:21,441
- <i>Hello?</i>
- <i>Hey!</i>

1124
01:26:21,507 --> 01:26:23,243
- <i>Hi.</i>
- <i>Where are you?</i>

1125
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:27,180
- <i>Um, I'm in my bedroom.</i>
- <i>Oh, nice.</i>

1126
01:26:28,748 --> 01:26:30,350
<i>Where are you?</i>

1127
01:26:30,417 --> 01:26:32,852
<i>I'm in the, um...
My living room.</i>

1128
01:26:32,918 --> 01:26:34,587
- <i>Nice.</i>
- <i>Sitting on the sofa.</i>

1129
01:26:34,653 --> 01:26:36,789
- <i>Comfy sofa?</i>
- <i>Scrumfy.</i>

1130
01:26:36,856 --> 01:26:38,758
<i>Scrumfy.</i>

1131
01:26:38,824 --> 01:26:40,293
<i>So I have
a few questions for you.</i>

1132
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,795
<i>Oh, wow.
Okay, I'm nervous now.</i>

1133
01:26:42,862 --> 01:26:45,265
<i>I thought
I'd get to know you better.</i>

1134
01:26:45,332 --> 01:26:47,867
<i>You know, I wrote a...
I typed up some questions</i>

1135
01:26:47,933 --> 01:26:50,002
<i>I thought I wanted to ask you.</i>

1136
01:26:50,069 --> 01:26:52,506
<i>Um, are you excited
for college?</i>

1137
01:26:52,571 --> 01:26:56,108
<i>Um... Whoa. I mean...</i>

1138
01:26:56,176 --> 01:26:57,810
Fuck! Holy shit!
Do you see that?

1139
01:26:57,877 --> 01:27:00,112
That's a manatee.
I fucking love manatees.

1140
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:02,449
They're like if a cow
and an elephant

1141
01:27:02,516 --> 01:27:03,849
had a baby in
the water.

1142
01:27:03,916 --> 01:27:05,252
You know what they're
more like is, uh,

1143
01:27:05,318 --> 01:27:07,421
like, they move so slow
like a sloth.

1144
01:27:07,487 --> 01:27:08,821
- Yeah, kind of. Yeah.
- You know?

1145
01:27:08,888 --> 01:27:10,257
We should go see them.

1146
01:27:10,323 --> 01:27:12,625
We should go, like,
up north

1147
01:27:12,691 --> 01:27:13,959
and swim with them.
Have you ever been?

1148
01:27:14,026 --> 01:27:17,297
- Do you know the springs?
- Um, no.

1149
01:27:17,364 --> 01:27:19,899
We should go. Do you want...
Would you be down to go?

1150
01:27:19,965 --> 01:27:21,100
Yeah, but how
would we do that?

1151
01:27:21,167 --> 01:27:24,371
We'd just take my car.
It's summer.

1152
01:27:24,438 --> 01:27:26,739
We can just take my car.
Whatever.

1153
01:27:29,209 --> 01:27:30,477
<i>When I was little,</i>

1154
01:27:30,544 --> 01:27:32,845
<i>I wanted to be a vet.</i>

1155
01:27:32,912 --> 01:27:34,647
<i>That was one of the
things I wanted to be,</i>

1156
01:27:34,713 --> 01:27:37,517
<i>which I still
really care about.</i>

1157
01:27:37,583 --> 01:27:40,187
<i>Would you then want to,
like, work at a zoo or something?</i>

1158
01:27:40,253 --> 01:27:41,821
<i>Well, if...
Yeah. I mean...</i>

1159
01:27:41,887 --> 01:27:46,025
<i>I like emergency, um,
vet clinics.</i>

1160
01:27:46,092 --> 01:27:47,394
- <i>Like that always...</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

1161
01:27:47,461 --> 01:27:49,061
<i>...excited me just because</i>

1162
01:27:49,128 --> 01:27:51,063
<i>I felt like if I can help
this animal in its...</i>

1163
01:27:51,130 --> 01:27:54,334
<i>In its moment of
intense need...</i>

1164
01:28:02,542 --> 01:28:05,611
- Do you sing?
- No. I mean, I do sing

1165
01:28:05,678 --> 01:28:07,414
but I'm not a good singer
for sure.

1166
01:28:07,481 --> 01:28:08,948
It hurts my heart.

1167
01:28:09,014 --> 01:28:11,551
- That you can't sing?
- No, totally.

1168
01:28:11,617 --> 01:28:14,221
Everybody can sing
in the shower though.

1169
01:28:14,287 --> 01:28:15,688
Not me.

1170
01:28:15,754 --> 01:28:16,922
I sing Vampire Weekend
in the shower,

1171

this started before, okay?

1231
01:33:28,835 --> 01:33:31,237
- It's just gotten worse.
- Unbelievable.

1232
01:33:31,304 --> 01:33:34,741
What?
What's unbelievable?

1233
01:33:34,808 --> 01:33:39,312
Will you say something to me?
Tell me. What is it? What?

1234
01:33:39,379 --> 01:33:41,748
What's unbelievable?
Catherine, please.

1235
01:33:41,815 --> 01:33:43,750
I'm right here.
I'm all ears. What is it?

1236
01:33:43,817 --> 01:33:46,586
I'm sorry I don't
want to fuck you right now.

1237
01:33:47,353 --> 01:33:48,354
Okay?

1238
01:33:50,390 --> 01:33:53,460
We are in crisis here.
Remember?

1239
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:55,462
Mmm-hmm.

1240
01:33:55,528 --> 01:33:58,531
It's so much.
There's so much to push through.

1241
01:34:00,065 --> 01:34:01,434
We shouldn't have to
think about that.

1242
01:34:01,501 --> 01:34:04,337
It's not just about
the sex, Catherine.

1243
01:34:04,404 --> 01:34:09,007
You're not here.
Like, you're not here.

1244
01:34:10,108 --> 01:34:13,213
You're not.
It's not a family anymore.

1245
01:34:14,314 --> 01:34:15,315
I...

1246
01:34:21,019 --> 01:34:23,456
We still have other things
to think about. All right?

1247
01:34:23,523 --> 01:34:26,426
- We still have a daughter.
- We still have a daughter?

1248
01:34:27,927 --> 01:34:30,162
Where are you?

1249
01:34:30,230 --> 01:34:31,831
- What do...
- What have you done for her?

1250
01:34:31,898 --> 01:34:33,666
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What are you doing for her?

1251
01:34:33,733 --> 01:34:37,504
- What are you talking about?
- You have...

1252
01:34:37,570 --> 01:34:40,773
You're not there for her.
You were never there for her.

1253
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:42,174
- Even before.
- What? No.

1254
01:34:42,242 --> 01:34:43,743
You show up,

1255
01:34:43,810 --> 01:34:45,411
you play Mr. Nice Guy, and
you leave all the work for me.

1256
01:34:45,478 --> 01:34:46,980
Is that what
you want me to do?

1257
01:34:47,045 --> 01:34:48,515
What in the hell
are you talking about?

1258
01:34:48,581 --> 01:34:49,782
You want me to go take care
of her again for you?

1259
01:34:49,849 --> 01:34:50,884
What are you talking about?

1260
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:52,452
You pushed him!

1261
01:34:53,253 --> 01:34:55,153
You pushed him!

1262
01:34:56,054 --> 01:34:57,624
You pushed him!

1263
01:35:00,125 --> 01:35:01,327
That's not...

1264
01:35:01,394 --> 01:35:03,229
You were not there for her.

1265
01:35:05,598 --> 01:35:07,767
It was different with Tyler,
and you know that.

1266
01:35:07,834 --> 01:35:09,536
- You know that I raised...
- You don't listen.

1267
01:35:09,602 --> 01:35:11,271
...these kids
the best way that I know.

1268
01:35:11,337 --> 01:35:12,906
You're not listening to me.
You don't listen to anyone!

1269
01:35:12,972 --> 01:35:14,707
Well, at least I'm here,
Catherine!

1270
01:35:14,774 --> 01:35:16,876
I'm the one that's trying to
hold this family together.

1271
01:35:16,943 --> 01:35:18,444
Where are you?

1272
01:35:18,511 --> 01:35:20,213
There's a little black boy
going out into this world...

1273
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:22,047
I'm grieving!

1274
01:35:23,283 --> 01:35:26,786
I'm just asking you, can I
grieve in my way, please?

1275
01:35:31,224 --> 01:35:32,892
Yeah. That's not fair.

1276
01:35:32,959 --> 01:35:35,762
I've done nothing
but be here for you.

1277
01:35:35,828 --> 01:35:37,764
That's all I've done.
I'm just trying to be a good...

1278
01:35:37,830 --> 01:35:39,131
I can't be around you. God.

1279
01:35:39,766 --> 01:35:41,166
Oh, God, you make me sick.

1280
01:35:41,234 --> 01:35:43,168
Wait... I make you sick?

1281
01:35:43,236 --> 01:35:45,638
What did I do
to make you sick?

1282
01:35:45,705 --> 01:35:49,309
Like, honestly,
I just want to be here for you, with you.

1283
01:35:49,375 --> 01:35:52,445
We're going through
this together.

1284
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:56,249
We're going through
this together.

1285
01:35:56,316 --> 01:35:58,318
Hey.

1286
01:35:59,352 --> 01:36:01,454
I can't.

1287
01:36:03,990 --> 01:36:05,458
I can't.

1288
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:10,597
I can't look at you
and not think of him.

1289
01:36:15,802 --> 01:36:17,337
I'm sorry.

1290
01:36:55,041 --> 01:36:59,312
You'll love my mom.
She's the fucking greatest.

1291
01:36:59,379 --> 01:37:02,649
She drives me crazy,
but she's the best.

1292
01:37:03,783 --> 01:37:05,551
What about your dad?

1293
01:37:06,753 --> 01:37:07,920
- My dad?
- Mmm-hmm.

1294
01:37:08,554 --> 01:37:09,589
Um...

1295
01:37:10,923 --> 01:37:12,392
He's not the best dude.

1296
01:37:15,061 --> 01:37:16,996
Do you want to talk about it?

1297
01:37:17,063 --> 01:37:19,265
Um, sure, yeah. Uh...

1298
01:37:21,834 --> 01:37:24,137
Well, when I was a kid,
he was just drunk

1299
01:37:24,203 --> 01:37:26,572
and on drugs a lot and, um...

1300
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:30,276
Just did some pretty terrible
stuff to me and my mom.

1301
01:37:30,343 --> 01:37:31,811
I mean, especially my mom.

1302
01:37:32,679 --> 01:37:34,013
And I couldn't do
anything about it,

1303
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:35,748
because I was just a kid.

1304
01:37:35,815 --> 01:37:39,285
But, yeah, eventually
my mom cut us off.

1305
01:37:42,488 --> 01:37:45,058
And you haven't
talked to him at all since?

1306
01:37:45,124 --> 01:37:48,428
No. No,
he actually has cancer.

1307
01:37:49,696 --> 01:37:52,432
- Really?
- Yeah, he has cancer.

1308
01:37:52,498 --> 01:37:53,866
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's all right.

1309
01:37:53,933 --> 01:37:56,502
He's a piece of shit.
He deserves it.

1310
01:37:56,569 --> 01:38:00,807
So... He's not in my life.
I don't know him.

1311
01:38:06,979 --> 01:38:09,549
I really wish I could
talk to my mom.

1312
01:38:09,615 --> 01:38:13,019
- You don't talk to her?
- No, she's dead.

1313
01:38:13,086 --> 01:38:16,155
Really? Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

1314
01:38:16,222 --> 01:38:18,324
No, it's fine.
It's okay. Um...

1315
01:38:18,391 --> 01:38:20,793
My stepmom is really my mom.

1316
01:38:20,860 --> 01:38:24,198
I mean, she's the one
who raised us, so...

1317
01:38:24,263 --> 01:38:26,532
Yeah, I haven't seen
my biological mom

1318
01:38:26,599 --> 01:38:28,468
since I was, like,
a little girl.

1319
01:38:28,534 --> 01:38:32,338
Oh, no. Um...
How'd she die?

1320
01:38:32,405 --> 01:38:34,006
She overdosed.

1321
01:38:34,073 --> 01:38:35,475
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1322
01:38:37,410 --> 01:38:40,346
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

1323
01:38:42,415 --> 01:38:43,883
I'm sorry too.

1324
01:38:45,485 --> 01:38:46,552
What are you going to do?

1325
01:38:46,619 --> 01:38:48,488
What are you going to do?

1326
01:38:56,028 --> 01:38:57,497
Do you know this song?

1327
01:38:59,031 --> 01:39:00,433
Is it Blood Orange?

1328
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:02,368
Mmm-mmm.

1329
01:39:02,435 --> 01:39:04,470
I don't... No, I don't.
Who is it?

and I'm responsible for that.

1395
01:44:16,383 --> 01:44:17,883
Well...

1396
01:44:17,950 --> 01:44:20,353
I don't even really know
what's going on with you.

1397
01:44:24,757 --> 01:44:26,158
How you doing with everything?

1398
01:44:26,759 --> 01:44:28,160
I'm good.

1399
01:44:28,228 --> 01:44:29,329
Yeah?

1400
01:44:29,396 --> 01:44:30,629
Yeah.

1401
01:44:31,864 --> 01:44:33,766
You know it's okay
if you're not.

1402
01:44:35,202 --> 01:44:37,304
You can tell me anything.
You know that, right?

1403
01:44:37,370 --> 01:44:38,871
Yeah, I know.

1404
01:44:39,573 --> 01:44:41,874
I worry about you.

1405
01:44:41,941 --> 01:44:44,009
Dad,
you don't need to worry about me.

1406
01:44:44,076 --> 01:44:45,212
Okay.

1407
01:44:45,278 --> 01:44:47,347
- Okay? I'm fine.
- All right. All right.

1408
01:44:50,584 --> 01:44:52,651
How are you doing
with everything?

1409
01:44:53,353 --> 01:44:54,687
Me?

1410
01:44:58,724 --> 01:45:00,059
It's been hard.

1411
01:45:01,127 --> 01:45:02,128
Hasn't it?

1412
01:45:13,105 --> 01:45:15,375
Don't know how to connect
with your mother anymore.

1413
01:45:17,377 --> 01:45:19,312
- What do you mean?
- She won't look at me.

1414
01:45:20,614 --> 01:45:22,182
She won't talk to me.

1415
01:45:23,749 --> 01:45:26,186
I think she hates me.
I really do.

1416
01:45:26,253 --> 01:45:28,721
- Dad, she doesn't hate you.
- No, she might.

1417
01:45:30,823 --> 01:45:33,025
She's just shutting down,
you know?

1418
01:45:33,759 --> 01:45:35,328
She won't go to work.

1419
01:45:36,162 --> 01:45:37,997
Couldn't even if
she wanted to.

1420
01:45:39,232 --> 01:45:41,934
The business will not recover.
We're just losing money.

1421
01:45:42,001 --> 01:45:43,169
Just...

1422
01:45:47,806 --> 01:45:49,742
I just love her so much

1423
01:45:50,943 --> 01:45:54,113
but I'm losing her,
and I don't know what to do.

1424
01:45:55,848 --> 01:45:57,417
I'm sorry.

1425
01:45:57,484 --> 01:45:59,553
Dad, don't apologize.

1426
01:45:59,619 --> 01:46:01,288
- I shouldn't be telling you all this.
- Dad, don't apologize.

1427
01:46:01,354 --> 01:46:02,455
No, it's okay.

1428
01:46:02,522 --> 01:46:03,856
It's just...

1429
01:46:03,923 --> 01:46:05,292
I don't have anyone else
to talk to.

1430
01:46:05,358 --> 01:46:07,294
I know. It's okay. Dad.

1431
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:08,761
- Dad.
- Yeah?

1432
01:46:08,827 --> 01:46:10,863
Look, I'm really happy
you're telling me this stuff.

1433
01:46:10,930 --> 01:46:14,367
- I promise, okay?
- Okay.

1434
01:46:15,402 --> 01:46:17,437
Thank you.

1435
01:46:18,704 --> 01:46:20,072
Thank you.

1436
01:46:36,722 --> 01:46:38,425
You know,
I could've stopped it.

1437
01:46:39,925 --> 01:46:41,760
Stopped what?
What do you mean?

1438
01:46:43,128 --> 01:46:45,332
Well...

1439
01:46:46,865 --> 01:46:49,202
I was there that night and...

1440
01:46:49,269 --> 01:46:53,440
I saw him following her.
And I...

1441
01:46:53,506 --> 01:46:56,176
I had that sick feeling
in my stomach.

1442
01:46:57,477 --> 01:46:58,811
Um...

1443
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:02,982
I don't know what happened.
I kind of just froze.

1444
01:47:03,583 --> 01:47:04,850
Baby.

1445
01:47:07,587 --> 01:47:10,323
It's just so crazy,

1446
01:47:10,390 --> 01:47:12,359
'cause if I just
would've gotten up...

1447
01:47:12,425 --> 01:47:13,693
- You know?
- No. No.

1448
01:47:13,759 --> 01:47:16,363
If I just would've
gotten up, then...

1449
01:47:17,731 --> 01:47:19,666
I would've went up to him
and stopped him,

1450
01:47:19,733 --> 01:47:21,601
- and she would still be here.
- Wait. Listen to me.

1451
01:47:21,668 --> 01:47:22,935
- This is not your fault.
- So I just... Yeah, it is.

1452
01:47:23,002 --> 01:47:24,837
- No, it's not.
- It is.

1453
01:47:24,903 --> 01:47:26,539
- Because I was there.
- No, and you can't blame yourself for it.

1454
01:47:26,606 --> 01:47:28,208
- I could've done something...
- You understand me?

1455
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:29,509
- ...and I just didn't.
- You didn't do this.

1456
01:47:29,576 --> 01:47:30,610
Your brother did it.
It's not...

1457
01:47:30,677 --> 01:47:32,144
I chose not to do anything.

1458
01:47:32,212 --> 01:47:33,413
Sweetheart, you didn't do it.
This is not...

1459
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:34,681
And I don't know
why I did that.

1460
01:47:34,748 --> 01:47:35,781
This is not your fault.

1461
01:47:35,848 --> 01:47:37,049
It is.

1462
01:47:37,116 --> 01:47:38,851
It's not your fault.

1463
01:47:38,917 --> 01:47:40,720
Emily, hey.

1464
01:47:40,786 --> 01:47:44,056
And I hate him so much.

1465
01:47:44,123 --> 01:47:46,760
- I hate him so much!
- I know.

1466
01:47:46,825 --> 01:47:50,463
What he did is evil, Dad!
He's evil.

1467
01:47:50,530 --> 01:47:52,865
- He's a... He's a monster!
- I understand that...

1468
01:47:52,931 --> 01:47:54,301
He's a monster for
doing that to her! I don't...

1469
01:47:54,367 --> 01:47:56,536
I understand
that you're angry.

1470
01:47:56,603 --> 01:47:58,103
- How does somebody do that?
- You have every right to be.

1471
01:47:58,170 --> 01:48:00,240
Do you hear me?
But your brother?

1472
01:48:00,307 --> 01:48:03,842
He's not a monster.
He's not evil.

1473
01:48:03,909 --> 01:48:05,978
He's just a human being.

1474
01:48:09,649 --> 01:48:12,452
I know the pain that
you're feeling right now.

1475
01:48:13,553 --> 01:48:15,221
Believe me, I know it.

1476
01:48:24,129 --> 01:48:26,599
I think about your brother
every day

1477
01:48:28,401 --> 01:48:31,870
and the things that
I could've done differently.

1478
01:48:33,306 --> 01:48:36,309
But we can't change it,
you know?

1479
01:48:36,376 --> 01:48:37,943
All we have is now.

1480
01:48:39,044 --> 01:48:40,313
All we have is now.

1481
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:43,082
And I'm telling you this
because I love you.

1482
01:48:43,148 --> 01:48:47,119
Holding on to that much
hate will destroy a person,

1483
01:48:47,187 --> 01:48:49,855
and I'm not about to let
that happen to you.

1484
01:48:51,424 --> 01:48:55,328
You have so much love
to share with the world.

1485
01:48:56,028 --> 01:48:58,264
And so much life yet to live.

1486
01:48:59,466 --> 01:49:01,534
Hey, you remember
Papa's favorite scriptures?

1487
01:49:02,335 --> 01:49:06,004
It said,
"Hatred stirs up strife,

1488
01:49:06,972 --> 01:49:11,143
"but love,
love covers all offenses."

1489
01:49:12,312 --> 01:49:15,548
And I love you so much,
baby girl. Come here.

1490
01:49:23,556 --> 01:49:24,624
It's okay.

1491
01:49:26,559 --> 01:49:29,763
- I love you too.
- I know you do. I know.

1492
01:50:15,107 --> 01:50:17,109
What are you thinking about?

1493
01:50:20,780 --> 01:50:23,949
Uh, the hospital where
my dad's at called today.

1494
01:50:24,016 --> 01:50:25,685
Really? What did they say?

1495
01:50:26,686 --> 01:50:28,655
They don't think
he has much longer.

1496
01:50:29,756 --> 01:50:31,291
Oh, um...

1497
01:50:33,158 --> 01:50:35,328
Do they know how long?

1498
01:50:35,395 --> 01:50:36,629
Um...

1499
01:50:36,696 --> 01:50:38,298
I don't know.
Like, not long at all.

1500
01:50:38,364 --> 01:50:41,434
They said he doesn't
have more than a week.

1501
01:50:43,436 --> 01:50:44,737
Um, what are you going to do?

1502
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:48,106
What do you mean?

1503
01:50:48,173 --> 01:50:50,276
- Well, you have to see him.
- Why?

1504
01:50:51,177 --> 01:50:52,612
Because he's your dad.

1505
01:50:52,679 --> 01:50:55,013
Okay, I don't want to see him.
And besides,

1506
01:50:55,080 --> 01:50:57,115
my car's in the shop
and he's in Missouri.

1507
01:50:57,183 --> 01:50:58,585
Well, we can take my car.

1508
01:50:59,319 --> 01:51:00,553
You have to see your dad.

1509
01:51:00,620 --> 01:51:02,655
You will seriously regret it
if you don't.

1510
01:51:05,859 --> 01:51:08,093
Okay, it says it's gonna
take two days to get there,

1511
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:10,430
but we can leave tomorrow.
We could...

1512
01:51:10,497 --> 01:51:13,733
We could stop and we could
break it up along the way.

1513
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:16,736
Do you think you could make up
an excuse for your mom?

1514
01:51:16,803 --> 01:51:19,472
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

1515
01:51:24,577 --> 01:51:26,044
- Can you make up an excuse?
- Yeah, yeah.

1516
01:51:26,111 --> 01:51:27,947
I guess I could
make up an excuse.

1517
01:51:28,013 --> 01:51:29,349
Do you think... Could you?

1518
01:51:43,363 --> 01:51:45,097
I think we should do it.

Hey, I think this is it.

1543
01:53:51,357 --> 01:53:53,926
This is the slowest
fucking elevator.

1544
01:53:57,630 --> 01:53:58,698
Yeah.

1545
01:54:19,819 --> 01:54:22,689
Hey, Dad. Hi.

1546
01:54:58,958 --> 01:55:00,460
I missed you.

1547
01:55:05,631 --> 01:55:08,668
This is my girlfriend, Emily.

1548
01:55:10,536 --> 01:55:13,940
Hi.
It's nice to meet you.

1549
01:55:21,914 --> 01:55:23,649
Beautiful.

1550
01:55:26,119 --> 01:55:27,453
Thank you.

1551
01:55:37,231 --> 01:55:40,933
<i>Well, he's fighting.
Everyone is different.</i>

1552
01:55:42,368 --> 01:55:46,873
Sometimes it's rapid,
sometimes it takes time.

1553
01:55:46,939 --> 01:55:49,842
He might be holding on more
because you're here now.

1554
01:55:51,043 --> 01:55:53,379
However, this is taking
longer than usual

1555
01:55:53,446 --> 01:55:55,715
and longer than
we had anticipated.

1556
01:55:56,649 --> 01:56:00,553
Obviously,
he's not ready to go yet.

1557
01:56:00,620 --> 01:56:03,055
And the best thing
that you can do

1558
01:56:03,122 --> 01:56:08,027
is to help him feel peace
and comfort when he's lucid.

1559
01:56:09,495 --> 01:56:11,964
So if there's anything
that you need,

1560
01:56:12,031 --> 01:56:13,800
please let us know.

1561
01:56:13,866 --> 01:56:17,436
And I'll be back tomorrow
to check in.

1562
01:56:17,503 --> 01:56:19,105
Thank you very much,
Doctor.

1563
01:56:19,172 --> 01:56:21,340
Thank you very much,
Doctor. I appreciate it.

1564
01:57:42,222 --> 01:57:43,522
Babe.

1565
01:57:44,258 --> 01:57:46,392
Baby, baby, wake up.

1566
01:57:46,459 --> 01:57:47,994
- Wake up.
- What's up?

1567
01:57:48,060 --> 01:57:51,163
It's your dad. Your dad.
Baby, your dad.

1568
01:57:54,567 --> 01:57:57,169
Hey. Do you have to
go to the bathroom?

1569
01:57:58,938 --> 01:58:00,072
Bathroom?

1570
01:59:26,492 --> 01:59:28,694
What are you
holding onto, Dad?

1571
01:59:32,164 --> 01:59:34,368
What's going on?
What are you feeling?

1572
01:59:34,434 --> 01:59:35,435
Talk to me.

1573
01:59:35,501 --> 01:59:36,969
Or not.

1574
01:59:44,510 --> 01:59:46,812
You know, um...

1575
01:59:48,647 --> 01:59:50,850
You don't need
to fight anymore.

1576
01:59:54,587 --> 01:59:56,789
I just want you
to be at peace.

1577
01:59:58,157 --> 01:59:59,226
Um...

1578
02:00:00,860 --> 02:00:03,562
You know you're going
to someplace better.

1579
02:00:03,629 --> 02:00:05,465
- Right?
- I know.

1580
02:00:05,531 --> 02:00:07,933
Yeah. You know.

1581
02:00:10,370 --> 02:00:12,239
You don't have any regrets?

1582
02:00:15,941 --> 02:00:17,143
Kind of.

1583
02:00:17,210 --> 02:00:18,544
Yeah?

1584
02:00:19,779 --> 02:00:20,980
Yeah? Well,
you don't have to.

1585
02:00:21,047 --> 02:00:22,482
You don't need to.

1586
02:00:22,548 --> 02:00:23,916
You're okay.

1587
02:00:53,112 --> 02:00:55,315
Yeah, Dad.
Just let it out.

1588
02:07:15,994 --> 02:07:18,665
Okay, folks.
15 minutes.

1589
02:07:46,192 --> 02:07:48,695
God wants us...

1590
02:07:50,797 --> 02:07:52,998
- Amen.
- Amen.

1591
02:07:53,065 --> 02:07:54,267
It doesn't matter
what happened.

1592
02:07:54,334 --> 02:07:55,702
What I'm talking about...

1593
02:10:31,081 --> 02:10:34,460
