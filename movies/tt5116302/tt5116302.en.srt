1
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,446
Haw, Togo! Haw! Haw!

2
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,827
Good dog! Good dog!

3
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,791
Leave it!

4
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,675
Leave it alone!

5
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,358
Good dog.

6
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,198
Well done, Togo!

7
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,174
Well done, all!

8
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,629
There'll be full bellies
and warm beds tonight.

9
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,049
All right, Togo! Hike!

10
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,786
Whoa!

11
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,961
There's been a diphtheria outbreak.

12
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,043
How long?

13
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,167
- More than a week.
- Constance?

14
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,264
Fine. She's fine.

15
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,383
It's mostly children.

16
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,394
Five have died.

17
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,140
Bless them.

18
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,930
Twenty more sick here in Nome.

19
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,929
And no telling how many
in the Inuit villages.

20
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,769
They found serum in Fairbanks.

21
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,612
They just don't know how
to get it from there to here.

22
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:56,649
Anyway, everybody's at Dexter's,
and they're asking for you.

23
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,119
Hike!

24
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,829
What we have in our children
is an epidemic.

25
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,746
And without antitoxin,
it's a death sentence to most,

26
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,174
if not all those infected.

27
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,165
The good news is,

28
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,756
they've located antitoxin
at the Fairbanks Railroad Hospital,

29
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,430
and they're ready
to put it on the next train to Nenana.

30
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,143
A round trip from here to Nenana
is still 600 miles.

31
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:30,524
They have aeroplanes in Fairbanks,
and we could fly it here.

32
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,753
Did you see those clouds on the horizon
when you came over?

33
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,402
Of course I did,
but maybe it's not as bad as it looks.

34
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,659
Seppala, you were out there.
What do you think?

35
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:42,993
It's going to be bad.

36
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:45,913
How bad?

37
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,004
Memorable, I think.

38
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,998
What makes you think?

39
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,577
Well, it looks biblical enough,

40
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:56,797
and the barometer's falling
in a pretty disturbing way but...

41
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,012
But what?

42
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,626
We came up on caribou this morning.

43
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,548
About 200 yards to our right, he saw them.

44
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:08,767
My foot was ready on the brake,
and he ignored them and kept running.

45
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,524
That's when I knew this storm was special.

46
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,153
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

47
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,441
Togo's a caribou chaser of some renown.

48
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,859
I still don't understand.

49
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:23,374
Never in 12 years
had he not at least turned for them.

50
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,485
When an animal denies his nature

51
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,326
and runs for the barn
because he fears the storm...

52
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,834
man better fear the storm.

53
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,673
I see.

54
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,801
In a storm like this,
how quickly could you get there and back?

55
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,299
Not "how quickly,"

56
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,381
"if."

57
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,223
Then I say aeroplane.

58
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,847
Open cockpit aeroplane?

59
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,137
Water-cooled engines?
Did you call that airfield in Fairbanks?

60
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,555
They're making an assessment.

61
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:52,733
I'll bet they are.

62
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,483
I seriously don't think
flying's an option.

63
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,818
But, in answer to your question,
"how quick?"

64
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,401
Seppala once ran for me,
all the way to Nenana, in four days.

65
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,992
For factual reference only.

66
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,794
Personally I never cared
for the notion that sled dogs

67
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,618
should be replaced by machines,

68
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,076
but today I'm a champion of progress.

69
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:18,799
Come on, pup.

70
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,107
Seppala, you going by the hospital?

71
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,124
Climb on.

72
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:53,871
Hike!

73
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,719
Whoa! Whoa!

74
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,601
Much obliged.

75
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,821
Good luck, doctor.

76
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:29,488
Towns are, uh,
usually founded by topography...

77
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,037
proximity to roads and rivers.

78
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,250
Nome was founded by luck.

79
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,711
The gold at Anvil Creek?

80
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,455
You could see it with your naked eye,

81
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,550
pick it up with your fingers
from the sand.

82
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,514
Gold dries up.

83
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,104
Luck dries up.

84
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,932
Where does he find the energy?

85
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,977
By his reckoning,
he's still ten weeks old.

86
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,573
So, you'll go?

87
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,871
I just got home.
You're anxious to be rid of me?

88
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,253
Hmm. Could be.

89
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,290
Have reason for me to be gone, do you?

90
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,825
- I have lovers.
- Ah?

91
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,168
Too many to count.

92
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,302
I have no one but myself to blame.

93
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:52,377
I was warned
not to marry someone so beautiful.

94
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,797
Warned by whom?

95
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,139
Everyone with eyesight.

96
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,229
So, you will go?

97
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,612
I have no such inclination.

98
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,519
Then why are you waxing sled runners?

99
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,488
They need wax.

100
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,750
Can it even be done in this weather?

101
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,462
Anything can be done.

102
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,625
Well, let them choose
someone else for once.

103
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,511
- The room was full of mushers.
- Right.

104
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,431
But it's always my husband they come for.

105
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,301
Pick someone with more at stake in this.

106
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:45,187
I stopped at the hospital.
All those children, we know them.

107
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,024
I know.

108
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:51,065
That little girl that lives next to Mallon
and always runs out to pet the dogs.

109
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,491
Sally, who pets everyone's dogs,
not just yours.

110
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,316
We know those children.
We know their parents.

111
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,197
I understand this.
And tomorrow I'll be ashamed.

112
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,327
But right now, I'm sorry, I'm afraid.

113
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,048
It's not the first storm to hit Alaska.

114
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,418
Don't patronize me.

115
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,014
You're right.

116
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,962
Don't take Togo. Fritz could lead.

117
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,131
I'll cross that bridge when and if.

118
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,800
He's 12 years old.
You said he's too old to go to Elwald,

119
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,959
and that isn't even
a quarter of this distance.

120
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,798
You're upsetting yourself for nothing.

121
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,012
Let's go to sleep.

122
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,748
I must say this before you make a decision
you'll forever regret.

123
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:18,573
You're more attached to him than you know,
and you're about to run him to his death.

124
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,620
And you're not prepared for what
it's going to do to you, I promise you.

125
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,250
Is that all?

126
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:30,165
He is, of course, your dog,
and a working dog.

127
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,250
And, were I more pragmatic,
I wouldn't love him, but I do.

128
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:39,177
And I'm just so heartsick
that these are my last hours with him.

129
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,141
Two things.

130
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:48,097
One: if I were to try for Nenana
in these conditions without him,

131
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,234
these would be your last hours with me.

132
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:56,532
And two: at this hour, nothing's decided.

133
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:02,818
You were saying?

134
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,247
George?

135
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,674
Evening, George.

136
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,961
It appears your forecast is correct,

137
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,300
if my journey out here is any evidence.

138
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,549
The wind almost stopped me dead
a couple times.

139
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:29,347
Oh, I... I talked with Fairbanks.
There will be no airborne rescue of Nome.

140
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:36,523
So, the time of the dog,
not only continues, it's at hand.

141
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:39,438
So, you felt the need to come
all the way out here to share this news?

142
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,357
Some things you need to say
to a man's face,

143
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,816
isn't that right, Mr. Mayor?

144
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,199
Yeah.

145
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,289
Coffee or whiskey?

146
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:50,211
Whiskey. If it's no trouble.

147
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:53,248
No. No trouble. I'm having both.

148
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,721
We have to be smart about this.

149
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,892
You're going to ride in the sled
when I tell you.

150
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,518
No squirming. No arguments, for once.

151
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,910
Got one more in ya, pup?

152
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,044
Almost there.

153
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,539
Good dogs.

154
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:45,756
I've seen worse.

155
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:47,848
We could have a picnic.

156
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,860
I'll be back before you know it.

157
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:58,859
I won't even make the bed.

158
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,581
Hey. Hey.

159
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,457
You bring him back to me, okay?

160
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,712
And you come back to me.

161
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:26,887
Good boy.

162
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,150
All right, Togo!

163
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:48,777
Hike!

164
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:32,406
Come on, Togo!

165
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,082
Come on, Togo!

166
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,962
Come on! There you go.

167
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:40,708
Hike!

168
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,704
Here it comes.

169
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,004
You tend to your business,
I'll tend to mine.

170
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:08,205
How can it not be my business?
No dogs in the bedroom.

171
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,836
He's in such pain.

172
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,093
And in our bedroom.

173
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:16,345
A runt has more imperfections
than just size, you know.

174
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:20,425
Nature has its ways of sorting things out.

175
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:23,017
Oh, should I just drown him
and speed up the process?

176
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:30,150
I'm just saying that Alaska
can be particularly cruel to the weak.

177
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,025
I don't need to be reminded.

178
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,279
What does it cost you
to give this life a chance?

179
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,829
What does he bring
to the breed if he survives?

180
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,380
The heart of a survivor.

181
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,628
You're too softhearted.

182
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,799
You're too Norwegian.

183
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,446
Get!

184
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,697
Why don't you put him back in the kennel?

185
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,405
Every time I do, he digs his way out.

186
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:28,747
I'm spending more daylight filling holes
than doing the work I should be doing.

187
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,917
I catch you, you'll be sorry.

188
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,551
It's all your fault.

189
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,017
I thought you were supposed to be
a great trainer of dogs.

190
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,518
He's a devil.

191
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Saint Francis of Assisi
would shoot this dog.

192
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,395
Hey!

193
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,901
- He's fast.
- He's mentally deficient.

194
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:55,322
He's undersized,
unintelligent, untrainable.

195
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:57,363
Yeah, but he's fast.

196
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,567
I think you ought to give him
a chance on the sled.

197
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,577
Stop, stop. That is not a sled dog.

198
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,790
Never ever.

199
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,540
Well, you won't know until you try.

200
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:07,292
I won't know, period.

201
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,584
Victor Anderson wants one of my pups.

202
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,497
Well, I have the dog to give him.

203
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,719
Every year we go through this.

204
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:22,264
Not like this.

205
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,517
How many times do I have to remind you?

206
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,139
They're not pets. They're not our friends.
They're not our children.

207
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,690
They're animals.

208
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:31,942
Work animals.

209
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,158
Serves you right.

210
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,179
Here you go.

211
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,868
Here's your damn dog back!

212
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:25,469
Well, shame on you, Victor Anderson.
If you didn't want a dog, why bother us?

213
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,433
He's more trouble than he's worth.

214
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:33,729
I think I'll go down now.

215
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:36,483
I would.

216
00:22:58,753 --> 00:22:59,753
Hike up!

217
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,022
The easy part is over.

218
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:36,035
Easy! Easy!

219
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:57,852
Whoa. Whoa!

220
00:23:58,855 --> 00:23:59,855
Haw!

221
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:05,951
Whoa!

222
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:39,272
Togo! Hike up! Hike up!

223
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:50,070
Togo! Togo! Hike up!
Hike up!

224
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:02,499
Pull, Togo!

225
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:03,835
Pull!

226
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,171
Pull up!

227
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:14,346
Pull!

228
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:17,141
Togo! Pull up!

229
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:27,693
Yes!

230
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:29,236
Yes!

231
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:37,004
Good dog!

232
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,629
Yes! Pull.

233
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,428
Good dog!

234
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:59,434
Next time I go the wrong way,
you tell me to go to hell.

235
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:02,024
Good dog.

236
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:04,648
Good dogs, all!

237
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:13,072
We have to take care of this
at the roadhouse.

238
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:32,838
Thank you.

239
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:56,834
Her name, Atiqtalik,

240
00:26:56,908 --> 00:26:59,948
means "polar bear mother."

241
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:03,674
Your dog is her cub now.

242
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:18,345
She can fix.

243
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,640
What does her song say?

244
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:27,977
"Don't worry, young one...

245
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:32,361
soon it'll be warm again."

246
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:42,828
When I finish,
you'll start serving life in prison.

247
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:45,867
All because I married a Belgian.

248
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:49,094
Belgium is a soft country.

249
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:52,964
Norway, on the other hand,
is a harsh country.

250
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:57,335
In Brussels,
you'd sleep in a feathered bed

251
00:27:58,011 --> 00:27:59,931
and have salmon roe for breakfast.

252
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:03,644
In Storfjord, your days would be numbered.

253
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:08,976
Lesson number one: never marry a Belgian.

254
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:11,316
They're sentimental.

255
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,229
And you end up doing days of hard work

256
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:16,448
for a problem that a bullet
solves in seconds.

257
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:22,704
Lesson number two: for you, Satan,
or whatever your name is...

258
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,750
try digging out now.

259
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:45,137
Okay!

260
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:50,686
Hike! Hike! Good job!

261
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:11,956
Hey! Stop that!

262
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:14,081
Hey!

263
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:17,535
Hey, stop that! Hey!

264
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:20,167
Whoa!

265
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:22,757
No! No!

266
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:24,925
You.

267
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:32,773
Oh, no.

268
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:35,101
Easy now. Leave it!

269
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:36,226
Leave it!

270
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:38,765
No! No!

271
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:42,191
Leave it! No!

272
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:47,319
On by!

273
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,660
Leave it!

274
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:59,207
Leave it alone!

275
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:02,838
No!

276
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:08,597
Whoa!

277
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:13,887
Haw! Haw!

278
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:45,471
Go! Get!

279
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:51,716
Since when did you start worrying about
keeping people out of the tack room?

280
00:32:51,805 --> 00:32:53,425
This isn't for keeping people out.

281
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,190
You're taking him out of the kennel
and putting him in here?

282
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,690
The kennel won't hold him.

283
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:03,361
- Apparently your dog...
- Not my dog.

284
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:06,111
Your dog, who disrupts my team.

285
00:33:06,194 --> 00:33:08,204
Your dog, who jumps on me

286
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:10,779
no matter how many knees
I put to his chest.

287
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:13,985
Your dog,
who violates the rules of the pack

288
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:17,537
and upsets the hierarchy
I've worked years to establish.

289
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:22,753
Your cur,
who rewards your kind nature with anarchy.

290
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:26,134
This is for keeping him in.

291
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:33,141
Was that a piece of our house?

292
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:09,261
Hey!

293
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:10,381
Hike!

294
00:34:14,512 --> 00:34:15,512
Good dogs!

295
00:36:39,407 --> 00:36:40,867
Well, good afternoon.

296
00:36:52,337 --> 00:36:53,587
Good luck, little one.

297
00:36:58,593 --> 00:37:00,973
Hey! You again?

298
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:02,974
Just leave it. Leave it!

299
00:37:03,848 --> 00:37:05,978
Stop! No!

300
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:11,108
Stop! Let... You little devil.

301
00:37:13,024 --> 00:37:14,614
Hey! Stop that!

302
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,750
When you see Oki, say hello.

303
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:29,291
Not going to see Oki.

304
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:31,581
You're gonna cut across the Sound?

305
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:32,918
It'll save me a day.

306
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:34,173
It'll cost you your life.

307
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:35,384
I've done it before.

308
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:37,667
The ice is unpredictable now.

309
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:39,547
We'll make it. Listen to me,

310
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:44,141
stay away from contact with people
until I come back with the medicine.

311
00:37:45,765 --> 00:37:48,175
Who would be foolish enough
to come here in this weather?

312
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,690
All right, Togo.

313
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:42,905
Hike!

314
00:39:31,746 --> 00:39:33,916
Good dog! On by!

315
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,640
What, my pups, are we to fear ice now?

316
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:53,307
He which hath no stomach to this fight.

317
00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:57,475
Let him depart.
His passport shall be made.

318
00:39:57,564 --> 00:40:00,574
We will not die in that dog's company.

319
00:40:01,234 --> 00:40:06,454
Old dogs forget
but he will remember, with advantages,

320
00:40:06,531 --> 00:40:08,371
the feats he did that day.

321
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,580
Then shall our names familiar in his mouth
as household words,

322
00:40:14,664 --> 00:40:16,464
Seppala, the driver,

323
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:21,047
Fritz and Sally, Molly and Red and Togo,

324
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:23,761
the great Togo in lead,

325
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,220
be all in their flowing water bowls
freshly remembered.

326
00:40:29,012 --> 00:40:34,562
And dogs in Nome, now abed, shall think
themselves accursed they were not here.

327
00:40:35,852 --> 00:40:42,532
We few, we happy few,
we band of champions.

328
00:40:43,568 --> 00:40:47,278
Now, run, my pups. Run!

329
00:41:18,895 --> 00:41:21,015
Max, get this out to the Associated Press.

330
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,230
People should know what's happening here.

331
00:41:24,901 --> 00:41:26,441
This is all you want to write?

332
00:41:28,029 --> 00:41:29,239
It's all I have in me.

333
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:01,769
"Temperatures
of almost 60 degrees below zero

334
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,475
and winds topping 50 miles an hour."

335
00:42:04,566 --> 00:42:06,816
"Man and dog risk all

336
00:42:07,318 --> 00:42:10,568
on a 640-mile round trip."

337
00:42:10,655 --> 00:42:12,155
With lives in the balance,

338
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,490
a heroic race runs through conditions
so terrible we can scarcely imagine.

339
00:42:15,577 --> 00:42:18,257
The question on everyone's lips is not
"can they get there and back in time?"

340
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:20,208
but "can they get there and back at all?"

341
00:42:36,681 --> 00:42:39,931
Well done, pups. Well done!

342
00:43:06,836 --> 00:43:07,996
You're trail weary.

343
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:10,167
I've been worse.

344
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:13,802
So, to Nulato next?

345
00:43:14,344 --> 00:43:15,804
In an hour.

346
00:43:15,887 --> 00:43:17,677
Why? We bothering you?

347
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:20,314
Only the white man bothers me.

348
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:24,055
I only tolerate you
because I like your little dog.

349
00:43:24,604 --> 00:43:26,404
You like to bet on my little dog.

350
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:30,856
There are advantages
to being at this roadhouse on race days.

351
00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:36,832
Most dogs, when they reach Shaktoolik,
have worry in their eyes.

352
00:43:37,867 --> 00:43:40,037
This one, never.

353
00:43:40,745 --> 00:43:42,245
This one wants to hurry up and win

354
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:44,920
so he can chase caribou
and fight polar bear.

355
00:43:47,252 --> 00:43:48,802
I tried to give him away, you know.

356
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:53,590
Twice.

357
00:44:21,536 --> 00:44:22,746
Whoa!

358
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:33,342
When I told my father
I was leaving for Alaska,

359
00:44:33,965 --> 00:44:36,045
he laughed at me.
He thought it was a joke.

360
00:44:36,801 --> 00:44:38,851
Only an idiot would be foolish enough

361
00:44:38,928 --> 00:44:42,468
to give up an apprenticeship in Norway
to be unemployed in America.

362
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:47,811
When I said the word "gold,"
he slapped me.

363
00:44:48,813 --> 00:44:52,153
And he promised me
that the only gold I would find in Alaska

364
00:44:52,233 --> 00:44:53,993
was what I'd brought in my own teeth.

365
00:44:56,029 --> 00:44:57,529
He was right.

366
00:44:59,324 --> 00:45:01,624
I've dug so many holes in this country.

367
00:45:02,577 --> 00:45:06,747
The law of averages would say that,
at least, I'd find some gold but...

368
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:09,875
no.

369
00:45:13,254 --> 00:45:16,554
My business is dogs, not pets.
Working dogs.

370
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:18,803
And hard decisions have to be made.

371
00:45:19,552 --> 00:45:21,892
If this is the hardest decision
we ever have to make,

372
00:45:21,971 --> 00:45:24,221
then you can consider us lucky.

373
00:45:26,935 --> 00:45:29,395
You see spirit and something lovable.

374
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:34,605
All I see is trouble,
waste of time, and failure.

375
00:45:37,028 --> 00:45:38,028
Step up!

376
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:51,745
Oh, he's just perfect.

377
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:54,745
He's an escape artist, though,
as I told you before.

378
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:58,588
Oh. Don't worry about that.
I want him to be an inside dog.

379
00:45:58,675 --> 00:45:59,965
Well, inside might not...

380
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:02,101
Last winter I had wolves at the door.

381
00:46:02,178 --> 00:46:04,848
They would jump up at the window
and stare at me.

382
00:46:05,598 --> 00:46:09,268
Trust me. There were no wolves
where I was raised in Ireland.

383
00:46:09,352 --> 00:46:13,732
But with this lad by my side,
no wolf would dare enter.

384
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:15,475
Unless he opens the door for them.

385
00:46:16,526 --> 00:46:17,736
I beg pardon?

386
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:21,819
Uh, my wife was just reminding me that
we must be going.

387
00:46:21,906 --> 00:46:25,076
So, please, enjoy your puppy.

388
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,240
Thank you.

389
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:36,634
It's okay, sweetheart.
This is your new home.

390
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:42,091
He'll be fine.

391
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:03,569
Okay, hike!

392
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:12,871
That's enough now, you daft mongrel.

393
00:47:13,875 --> 00:47:15,745
You're no dog, you're the Devil himself.

394
00:47:16,586 --> 00:47:19,916
That's it. You go ahead and run.

395
00:47:20,006 --> 00:47:21,626
There's no way out.

396
00:47:22,842 --> 00:47:24,592
All the time in the world.

397
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:27,758
You'll run till you're tired,
then we can start working on your manners.

398
00:47:28,848 --> 00:47:32,308
Oi! This isn't Little Creek anymore,
you little hooligan.

399
00:47:41,027 --> 00:47:42,947
Ah, that's better.

400
00:47:43,613 --> 00:47:45,033
There you are.

401
00:47:45,115 --> 00:47:46,445
Now, you be a good boy

402
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:49,367
and I'll fix you a nice beef steak
for your lunch.

403
00:47:53,957 --> 00:47:55,497
Oh, no! No. No!

404
00:48:13,893 --> 00:48:15,603
Hike! Hike!

405
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:21,567
Whoa!

406
00:48:55,352 --> 00:48:56,602
Whoa!

407
00:49:08,156 --> 00:49:09,156
Hey!

408
00:49:10,492 --> 00:49:13,202
Every predator for miles
smells that blood.

409
00:49:13,995 --> 00:49:15,285
I'm trying to save your life.

410
00:49:16,331 --> 00:49:18,291
Okay, Russky, come with me.

411
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,750
Come on, up. Up.

412
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:25,339
Good dog.

413
00:49:27,217 --> 00:49:29,757
Oh, no. Don't even think about it.

414
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:40,941
All right. Last row for you.

415
00:49:44,067 --> 00:49:50,447
Meet Ilsa. Try something with her
and I promise you, you'll regret it.

416
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:14,721
All right, hike!

417
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:52,888
Well, you outran Ilsa.
Let's see how you do on point.

418
00:50:54,971 --> 00:50:55,971
Good.

419
00:50:57,682 --> 00:50:58,732
Come on.

420
00:51:02,062 --> 00:51:03,312
Good dog, Jens.

421
00:51:58,284 --> 00:51:59,374
Haw!

422
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,800
Good pups.

423
00:52:47,959 --> 00:52:51,669
Good dogs! Good dogs! Good dogs!

424
00:53:02,098 --> 00:53:05,058
Whoa!

425
00:53:05,143 --> 00:53:07,443
It's the most extraordinary thing
I've ever seen.

426
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,610
He's not a sled dog, he's a lead dog.

427
00:53:09,689 --> 00:53:12,479
You should have seen him.
He outran every single one of them.

428
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,860
- He's magnificent. A future champion.
- There's blood.

429
00:53:16,946 --> 00:53:20,906
You were right.
He's got the heart of a survivor.

430
00:53:22,869 --> 00:53:24,999
I'm going to name him Togo.

431
00:53:25,789 --> 00:53:29,919
After the admiral.
An underdog named for an underdog.

432
00:53:31,211 --> 00:53:32,301
It's fitting.

433
00:53:44,641 --> 00:53:47,561
Honey! Come here, please?

434
00:53:52,148 --> 00:53:54,438
Come. Step around him, he won't move.

435
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:57,736
- I have things to do.
- Over here. Next to me.

436
00:53:58,697 --> 00:53:59,697
Please.

437
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:10,920
Okay, now, call him.
Ask him to come into the bedroom.

438
00:54:11,793 --> 00:54:12,793
Do it.

439
00:54:14,087 --> 00:54:15,167
Togo, come.

440
00:54:15,797 --> 00:54:16,837
Again.

441
00:54:16,923 --> 00:54:20,013
- This isn't fair.
- Of course it is. Again, more demanding.

442
00:54:21,636 --> 00:54:24,506
Togo, you come in this room!

443
00:54:24,597 --> 00:54:26,977
My husband is trying to prove
a point of some kind.

444
00:54:28,143 --> 00:54:30,443
No dogs in the bedroom.

445
00:54:31,646 --> 00:54:33,816
Good boy, Togo. Good boy.

446
00:54:34,357 --> 00:54:36,647
Outstanding!

447
00:54:37,736 --> 00:54:38,736
Good dog.

448
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:41,486
I don't care what the governor says,
he's wrong.

449
00:54:41,573 --> 00:54:44,083
Irrespective of how you feel, Jafet...

450
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:45,579
Well, Mrs. Seppala.

451
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,660
Any musher would be lucky
to survive 30 miles in this weather.

452
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:51,327
Seppala's the only one
who can survive a longer run!

453
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:53,336
What's this nonsense about a relay?

454
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:56,550
Uh, now, Constance, this is a good thing.

455
00:54:56,629 --> 00:54:58,049
- Is this it?
- It is.

456
00:54:58,131 --> 00:55:00,341
Fourteen teams stationed
at these roadhouses

457
00:55:00,425 --> 00:55:02,215
between Nenana and Shaktoolik.

458
00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:04,392
Even as we speak,
they're running short legs

459
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:06,471
passing the serum
from one sled to the next.

460
00:55:06,556 --> 00:55:10,556
And on our end, two teams will go out
to these roadhouses and wait for Seppala.

461
00:55:11,895 --> 00:55:14,055
We'll need another sled
for the relay on our end.

462
00:55:14,147 --> 00:55:15,997
Is it possible you can
put together a team for us?

463
00:55:16,024 --> 00:55:17,034
Of course.

464
00:55:17,108 --> 00:55:18,538
Do you think your man, Gunnar,
would drive them?

465
00:55:18,568 --> 00:55:19,988
- Of course.
- Good.

466
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:21,610
The governor came up with this when?

467
00:55:21,696 --> 00:55:23,406
Twelve hours after Seppala departed.

468
00:55:24,657 --> 00:55:27,537
Leave it to a politician to change
the rules after the game's begun.

469
00:55:27,619 --> 00:55:29,999
No. This is a good thing.

470
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,540
Seppala won't have to go as far.

471
00:55:31,623 --> 00:55:34,173
- But he has no idea there's a relay.
- Exactly.

472
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:36,290
Just... Please.

473
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:40,296
Now, by best estimate,

474
00:55:40,382 --> 00:55:44,142
the relay should be at the roadhouse
in Shaktoolik tomorrow.

475
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:46,259
Now the governor's people
have worked this all out.

476
00:55:46,346 --> 00:55:49,516
And by all accounts, when Seppala arrives
at Shaktoolik tomorrow,

477
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,429
the serum will be there waiting for him.

478
00:55:51,518 --> 00:55:52,888
He's in Shaktoolik now.

479
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:56,900
- Or past it.
- What? No. No, that's not possible.

480
00:55:56,981 --> 00:56:00,321
I know my husband, if there's ice
on Norton Sound, he's crossed it.

481
00:56:00,402 --> 00:56:02,702
In this storm?
Surely he's not going to try and cross...

482
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:03,859
Of course he would.

483
00:56:04,656 --> 00:56:07,656
Going around the Sound
is 90 miles, crossing it is 20.

484
00:56:07,742 --> 00:56:08,992
He saves a day each way.

485
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:12,537
George, if there's ice on the Sound,
he's crossed it.

486
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:14,933
And if they don't meet at the roadhouse...

487
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:18,208
Then they'll just hook up on the trail.

488
00:56:18,294 --> 00:56:21,214
There are 1,000 ways a driver
can miss another on the trail.

489
00:56:21,297 --> 00:56:23,217
A thousand ways in good weather.

490
00:56:24,092 --> 00:56:26,012
- You know this.
- I do.

491
00:56:26,094 --> 00:56:29,474
So, if my husband doesn't magically run
into your relay team,

492
00:56:29,556 --> 00:56:30,656
the one he is not even looking for,

493
00:56:30,682 --> 00:56:32,392
he and his dogs will drive on for Nenana.

494
00:56:32,475 --> 00:56:35,725
And your relay driver,
when he realizes he's missed them,

495
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:37,232
he will set out on his own.

496
00:56:37,313 --> 00:56:38,673
But he wouldn't do that, would he?

497
00:56:38,732 --> 00:56:41,072
- Who is it? Who's the driver?
- Henry Ivanoff.

498
00:56:41,151 --> 00:56:43,031
Well, Henry is tough and brave,

499
00:56:43,111 --> 00:56:46,161
and he's not going to sit in front
of a warm fire while children die.

500
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:47,659
I promise you that. He'll set out.

501
00:56:50,285 --> 00:56:51,405
Well, can he make it?

502
00:56:54,122 --> 00:56:55,962
I won't speculate on the life of a musher.

503
00:56:58,585 --> 00:56:59,585
Can he?

504
00:57:01,588 --> 00:57:04,048
My guess is
we don't find Henry until the spring.

505
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:08,600
Not him, not his dogs,
not the serum, until the thaw.

506
00:57:09,512 --> 00:57:10,512
But, uh...

507
00:57:10,597 --> 00:57:12,137
Four days ago, in this very room,

508
00:57:12,223 --> 00:57:15,563
we concluded only one man and one dog
could make that run.

509
00:57:16,269 --> 00:57:18,019
And nothing has changed but the weather.

510
00:57:20,106 --> 00:57:21,226
It's worse.

511
00:57:21,858 --> 00:57:24,438
All those children... lost.

512
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:30,619
Pray they meet.

513
00:57:53,515 --> 00:57:55,055
Gee! Gee!

514
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:01,560
Gee! Gee! Round.

515
00:58:10,824 --> 00:58:13,244
Hike! Gee! Gee!

516
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:24,549
Leave it. Leave it!

517
00:58:25,171 --> 00:58:27,261
Haw! Haw!

518
00:58:30,176 --> 00:58:31,176
Leave it!

519
00:58:33,304 --> 00:58:34,314
Haw!

520
00:59:09,007 --> 00:59:10,007
No, no, no, no, no.

521
00:59:10,842 --> 00:59:12,052
Sepp, no!

522
00:59:12,802 --> 00:59:13,802
Don't!

523
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,220
Sepp! Sepp!

524
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:20,309
I have the serum!

525
00:59:21,936 --> 00:59:24,686
No! I have the serum.

526
00:59:25,857 --> 00:59:26,857
Sepp!

527
00:59:28,026 --> 00:59:29,066
Sepp!

528
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,320
No!

529
01:00:33,842 --> 01:00:37,682
Bill Shannon took the first leg.
Ran through the night.

530
01:00:38,513 --> 01:00:39,973
Fifty below, easy.

531
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:43,734
He arrived in Tolovana
with his face black from frostbite.

532
01:00:45,061 --> 01:00:47,151
He passed on to Ed Kallands.

533
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:50,981
They had to pour hot water on his hands
'cause they were frozen to the sled.

534
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:54,199
Then went Tommy Patsy.

535
01:00:56,197 --> 01:00:57,317
Then Jackscrew.

536
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:00,699
But none of us are as tough as you, Sepp.

537
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:08,877
- Sepp?
- Yeah, what?

538
01:01:10,211 --> 01:01:11,211
You okay?

539
01:01:12,797 --> 01:01:15,427
Of course. Never better.

540
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:22,024
What about him?

541
01:01:22,098 --> 01:01:23,138
What about him?

542
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,269
Please take this the right way, okay?

543
01:01:27,979 --> 01:01:31,229
That, right there,
is the best dog I've ever known...

544
01:01:33,026 --> 01:01:35,236
but what I'm looking at is a spent animal.

545
01:01:36,613 --> 01:01:40,123
He is.
This storm just about broke all my pups.

546
01:01:42,118 --> 01:01:44,698
I wouldn't be a true friend
if I didn't speak my mind and...

547
01:01:50,043 --> 01:01:52,923
Leave him here. I'll take good care of him
till the weather breaks.

548
01:01:53,004 --> 01:01:54,094
He's my lead!

549
01:01:56,257 --> 01:01:58,757
Now do yourself a favor
and tend to your own.

550
01:02:04,474 --> 01:02:05,484
Sure, Sepp.

551
01:02:13,066 --> 01:02:14,106
I'm sorry.

552
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:17,780
I shouldn't have spoken to you like that.

553
01:02:17,862 --> 01:02:19,492
Yeah, don't give it a second thought.

554
01:02:19,572 --> 01:02:22,492
No, that was shameful of me.

555
01:02:23,368 --> 01:02:25,948
Especially since what you said
was out of kindness.

556
01:02:28,206 --> 01:02:29,456
Whatever happens tomorrow,

557
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:32,591
fortune or fault,
is mine and mine to reconcile.

558
01:02:33,586 --> 01:02:36,126
But I thank you, Henry,
for thinking of the dog.

559
01:02:38,508 --> 01:02:39,678
Not many do.

560
01:02:45,724 --> 01:02:48,144
"To sleep, to sleep."

561
01:02:49,144 --> 01:02:50,984
The long bright day is done.

562
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:54,520
And darkness rises
from the fall of the sun.

563
01:02:56,067 --> 01:02:58,487
To sleep, to sleep.

564
01:02:59,696 --> 01:03:02,906
Whate'er thy joys,
they vanish with the day.

565
01:03:04,034 --> 01:03:08,204
Whate'er thy griefs,
in sleep they fade away.

566
01:03:09,164 --> 01:03:11,424
To sleep, to sleep.

567
01:03:12,208 --> 01:03:16,548
Sleep mournful heart
and let the past be past.

568
01:03:17,172 --> 01:03:19,262
Sleep, happy soul.

569
01:03:20,216 --> 01:03:22,796
All life will sleep at last.

570
01:03:24,846 --> 01:03:25,846
To sleep.

571
01:03:27,515 --> 01:03:28,765
"To sleep."

572
01:03:32,729 --> 01:03:34,649
Still time for me to place a bet?

573
01:03:34,731 --> 01:03:36,571
Thanks for your hospitality.

574
01:03:36,649 --> 01:03:37,939
Looks like I was wrong.

575
01:03:38,026 --> 01:03:41,696
You weren't wrong.
The die is cast. We'll make it.

576
01:03:52,415 --> 01:03:54,785
All right, Togo! Hike!

577
01:03:59,547 --> 01:04:01,047
He's going across the Sound again.

578
01:04:01,925 --> 01:04:03,585
Seppala, no!

579
01:04:04,761 --> 01:04:06,471
He knows what his dogs have left.

580
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:10,019
For him, it's the Sound or nothing.

581
01:04:48,388 --> 01:04:49,388
Hike!

582
01:05:04,237 --> 01:05:05,237
Gee! Gee!

583
01:05:18,209 --> 01:05:19,339
Haw! Haw!

584
01:05:22,797 --> 01:05:24,167
Good puppies!

585
01:05:25,508 --> 01:05:26,678
Good dogs!

586
01:05:27,635 --> 01:05:29,505
Good dog! Go puppies!

587
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:31,180
Go!

588
01:05:32,515 --> 01:05:33,925
Hold up, Togo!

589
01:05:36,353 --> 01:05:37,563
Good dog.

590
01:05:39,022 --> 01:05:40,022
Run!

591
01:05:42,275 --> 01:05:43,275
Run!

592
01:05:45,153 --> 01:05:46,203
On straight.

593
01:05:49,074 --> 01:05:50,454
Run, puppies!

594
01:06:02,253 --> 01:06:04,513
- Come on! Come on!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

595
01:06:09,636 --> 01:06:12,636
Twenty more dollars on Leonhard Seppala.

596
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:15,925
Twenty dollars on those itty-bitty dogs.

597
01:06:16,017 --> 01:06:17,887
Scotty Allan,
the greatest musher of all time,

598
01:06:17,977 --> 01:06:20,017
left the last roadhouse in the lead.

599
01:06:20,105 --> 01:06:21,225
Friend, this race is over.

600
01:06:35,662 --> 01:06:36,962
You see that?

601
01:06:37,038 --> 01:06:39,288
That's the best dog team
in the world, right there.

602
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:42,915
- Hike! Hike!
- They know who they are,

603
01:06:43,003 --> 01:06:45,013
time for us to find out who we are.

604
01:06:46,965 --> 01:06:50,635
Go! Come on, puppies!

605
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:53,219
Haw! Haw!

606
01:06:53,304 --> 01:06:58,234
Haw! Haw! Haw! Haw!

607
01:06:58,309 --> 01:06:59,729
Hike! Good dog!

608
01:07:07,235 --> 01:07:09,355
Come on, dogs! Come on, dogs!

609
01:07:09,446 --> 01:07:12,816
Hike! Hike! Hike! Hike!

610
01:07:12,907 --> 01:07:17,947
Good dogs! Good dogs! Good dogs!

611
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:19,038
Hike, doggy!

612
01:07:24,294 --> 01:07:25,504
Whoo-hoo!

613
01:07:27,756 --> 01:07:28,966
Wait a minute.

614
01:07:29,049 --> 01:07:30,379
That's not Scotty.

615
01:07:32,886 --> 01:07:33,966
Who is that?

616
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:38,814
That, my friends, is Leonhard Seppala
and his itty-bitty dogs.

617
01:07:38,892 --> 01:07:42,152
Whoo!

618
01:07:53,531 --> 01:07:55,951
Whoa!

619
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:01,960
Congratulations, Sepp.

620
01:08:08,797 --> 01:08:10,507
Togo. Hi.

621
01:08:10,924 --> 01:08:13,934
Well done. You did it.

622
01:08:14,552 --> 01:08:15,762
Good boy.

623
01:08:29,818 --> 01:08:32,148
Did you ever think we'd have
such a thing on our wall?

624
01:08:32,237 --> 01:08:35,657
I never thought we'd have
$5,000 in prize money.

625
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:37,700
Prize money you can't hang on a wall.

626
01:08:37,784 --> 01:08:40,754
Actually, you can if you have enough pins.

627
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:44,460
All thanks to this troublemaker.

628
01:08:45,417 --> 01:08:49,047
The only one
who never underestimated you, was you.

629
01:08:49,129 --> 01:08:52,339
And my genius wife.

630
01:08:52,424 --> 01:08:54,974
My beautiful, genius wife.

631
01:09:25,457 --> 01:09:26,457
Haw!

632
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:29,710
Haw!

633
01:09:47,979 --> 01:09:49,019
Hike up!

634
01:10:24,516 --> 01:10:25,516
Hike up!

635
01:10:30,188 --> 01:10:31,518
Up! Up! Up!

636
01:11:00,301 --> 01:11:01,301
Run!

637
01:11:10,395 --> 01:11:11,475
Hike up!

638
01:11:38,882 --> 01:11:40,882
Togo! Hike up! Go!

639
01:11:48,975 --> 01:11:49,975
Good dog!

640
01:11:51,519 --> 01:11:53,019
Good dog!

641
01:11:54,564 --> 01:11:55,944
Run puppies!

642
01:12:05,992 --> 01:12:06,992
We made it.

643
01:12:09,954 --> 01:12:11,414
We made it!

644
01:12:14,876 --> 01:12:16,586
Whoa! Whoa!

645
01:13:09,973 --> 01:13:12,643
No matter what happens, forgive me.

646
01:13:18,481 --> 01:13:21,191
Hike up, Togo! Hike!

647
01:13:26,781 --> 01:13:28,621
Hike up! Hike up!

648
01:13:37,334 --> 01:13:38,544
Pull up, Togo!

649
01:13:39,461 --> 01:13:40,631
Pull!

650
01:13:41,671 --> 01:13:42,841
Pull!

651
01:13:43,256 --> 01:13:45,216
No, Fritz. Wait! Wait!

652
01:13:57,062 --> 01:13:58,062
Yes!

653
01:14:01,483 --> 01:14:02,573
Yes! Hike!

654
01:14:36,101 --> 01:14:38,521
Good boy, Togo! Good dog.

655
01:14:41,314 --> 01:14:42,574
Good dogs, all!

656
01:14:49,155 --> 01:14:50,485
Get up there, puppies.

657
01:15:00,041 --> 01:15:01,381
You know, I can do that.

658
01:15:01,918 --> 01:15:04,048
I'll do it. Drink that.

659
01:15:27,485 --> 01:15:28,485
Why?

660
01:15:40,498 --> 01:15:42,328
The pine stings her eyes.

661
01:15:52,594 --> 01:15:54,304
Thank you for doing this, Gunnar.

662
01:15:54,387 --> 01:15:55,717
Anything I can do to help.

663
01:15:56,139 --> 01:15:58,309
My greatest worry is that
he'd be within miles and...

664
01:15:58,391 --> 01:16:00,231
No such thing is going to happen.

665
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:04,150
Sepp is the best musher I know.
Nothing will stop him from getting home.

666
01:16:04,230 --> 01:16:06,440
If you'll outfit the sled,
I'll start pulling dogs.

667
01:16:06,524 --> 01:16:08,194
No, no, Mrs. Seppala. I can do both.

668
01:16:08,276 --> 01:16:09,436
You should sleep.

669
01:16:09,527 --> 01:16:11,197
I've had my fill of time in the house.

670
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:14,819
If it's all the same to you,
I'd prefer to fetch dogs.

671
01:16:14,908 --> 01:16:17,908
Sure. And who do you think
I should have in lead?

672
01:16:17,994 --> 01:16:21,414
Fox is the best dog left.
Paired with Balto.

673
01:16:22,415 --> 01:16:23,535
They won't win any races,

674
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:25,785
but they'll plow through snow
and run home for dinner.

675
01:16:37,347 --> 01:16:38,347
Thank you.

676
01:16:47,148 --> 01:16:48,148
Hike up!

677
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:50,569
Good dogs.

678
01:16:57,117 --> 01:16:59,327
Pass the word
there's chores waiting for him.

679
01:17:00,203 --> 01:17:01,203
Gladly.

680
01:17:06,751 --> 01:17:08,841
Fox, Balto. Hike!

681
01:17:25,478 --> 01:17:26,478
Come with me.

682
01:17:27,105 --> 01:17:28,305
I haven't the time.

683
01:17:29,024 --> 01:17:30,074
Come.

684
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:31,440
I need to go.

685
01:17:40,201 --> 01:17:41,951
Last night I was worried about you.

686
01:17:43,997 --> 01:17:46,247
Thought you'd bit off
more than you could chew.

687
01:17:48,126 --> 01:17:49,206
Then I saw that.

688
01:17:50,837 --> 01:17:52,167
And asked myself...

689
01:17:53,256 --> 01:17:56,756
"Why should Amituk worry about any man...

690
01:17:58,136 --> 01:18:00,756
who cheats death like this?"

691
01:18:17,655 --> 01:18:19,445
Now, you're gonna ride in the sled.

692
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,330
Even if it's just for 20 miles.

693
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:31,125
Come now, for once ride in the sled.

694
01:18:33,672 --> 01:18:34,672
Stay.

695
01:18:58,071 --> 01:18:59,071
Hike!

696
01:19:44,034 --> 01:19:45,044
Whoa!

697
01:20:03,136 --> 01:20:07,216
Togo! I'm sorry. I can't help you.

698
01:20:08,016 --> 01:20:09,016
I can't see.

699
01:20:09,726 --> 01:20:11,726
We need to get to the next roadhouse.

700
01:20:12,437 --> 01:20:14,437
Take us to Big Joe. I know you can.

701
01:20:16,024 --> 01:20:17,194
I know you can.

702
01:20:18,068 --> 01:20:20,238
Good dog. Good dog.

703
01:20:21,738 --> 01:20:22,738
Hike up!

704
01:21:46,322 --> 01:21:47,572
Oh, no.

705
01:21:58,835 --> 01:21:59,955
Togo?

706
01:22:05,175 --> 01:22:06,175
Togo?

707
01:22:15,143 --> 01:22:18,153
We can't stop. We must keep going.

708
01:22:18,855 --> 01:22:23,775
Do you understand? We stop, we die.

709
01:22:24,569 --> 01:22:29,989
Listen to me, if you stop, you die.

710
01:22:40,335 --> 01:22:41,745
- Seppala?
- Oh!

711
01:22:43,421 --> 01:22:45,301
- Seppala, is that you?
- Oh, God.

712
01:22:45,382 --> 01:22:47,092
Joe, we're here.

713
01:22:47,175 --> 01:22:48,465
Oh, God.

714
01:22:48,551 --> 01:22:50,391
The serum's in the sled.

715
01:22:54,974 --> 01:22:57,194
You go inside.
I'll get the dogs in the barn.

716
01:22:57,268 --> 01:22:58,808
Thank you. But not him.

717
01:23:02,816 --> 01:23:04,776
You're magnificent.

718
01:23:11,741 --> 01:23:15,701
Magnificent. Magnificent.

719
01:23:16,746 --> 01:23:18,456
Seppala! Inside.

720
01:24:01,207 --> 01:24:02,917
Now, Leonhard, your race is over.

721
01:24:03,752 --> 01:24:04,922
Just have a drink with me.

722
01:24:11,843 --> 01:24:14,513
This one, this one here.

723
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:18,390
All those miles in this storm,
12 years old.

724
01:24:19,517 --> 01:24:21,307
That's just incredible.

725
01:24:21,394 --> 01:24:22,404
Wish me luck.

726
01:24:54,469 --> 01:24:56,139
Charlie, you made it.

727
01:24:56,221 --> 01:24:58,061
- Here.
- Is this the serum?

728
01:24:58,139 --> 01:24:59,929
- Warm this.
- Aye.

729
01:25:00,016 --> 01:25:01,726
- Good luck, Gunnar.
- Thanks.

730
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:04,650
My dogs, my dogs, they're... I need help.

731
01:25:52,068 --> 01:25:53,398
There is a sled coming to town.

732
01:26:04,205 --> 01:26:05,535
Here.

733
01:26:05,623 --> 01:26:06,713
Thank you.

734
01:26:13,465 --> 01:26:17,755
Sir, I need your name,
for the record, sir.

735
01:26:18,345 --> 01:26:19,635
Gunnar Kaasen.

736
01:26:20,263 --> 01:26:23,023
"Gunnar Kaasen." Excellent.

737
01:26:23,099 --> 01:26:26,189
Now, the lead dog. What's its name?

738
01:26:26,269 --> 01:26:27,899
One's called Fox.

739
01:26:27,979 --> 01:26:29,229
"Fox"?

740
01:26:29,314 --> 01:26:32,654
People will think it's a real fox.
The other one, what's its name?

741
01:26:33,401 --> 01:26:34,531
Balto.

742
01:26:34,611 --> 01:26:37,111
"Balto." Yeah. Perfect.

743
01:26:37,822 --> 01:26:40,372
Hey! Get that dog's photo there.

744
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:44,200
That's Balto. Champion savior of Nome.

745
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:38,220
You ought to stay another week, at least.

746
01:27:38,299 --> 01:27:39,469
Look at this.

747
01:27:39,551 --> 01:27:43,511
I know, I just wish
you would allow yourself more...

748
01:27:43,596 --> 01:27:45,556
You've been a fine host, Joe.

749
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,890
You treated me and my dogs like family.

750
01:27:47,976 --> 01:27:49,016
Thank you.

751
01:27:54,566 --> 01:27:55,646
He up to it?

752
01:28:01,573 --> 01:28:02,573
We'll make it.

753
01:29:21,736 --> 01:29:23,026
There's a dog in our bedroom.

754
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:24,860
Yes, there is.

755
01:29:26,991 --> 01:29:28,371
There's a dog on our bed.

756
01:29:29,369 --> 01:29:32,209
Yes. There is.

757
01:30:11,828 --> 01:30:12,908
You should've woke me.

758
01:30:13,997 --> 01:30:16,077
You had him to yourself long enough.

759
01:30:17,042 --> 01:30:18,882
Then again,
to hear the newspapers tell it,

760
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:21,880
you never left the house.
It was all Balto and Gunnar.

761
01:30:21,963 --> 01:30:23,053
We have company.

762
01:30:35,185 --> 01:30:37,805
If you like pears, these'll put
a smile on your face, I think.

763
01:30:37,896 --> 01:30:39,186
Thank you, Eileen. Come in.

764
01:30:40,315 --> 01:30:43,815
Ah, bacon.
It's the best I ever made right here.

765
01:30:43,902 --> 01:30:45,362
Thank you, Bill.

766
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:48,030
Hey, Sepp!

767
01:30:48,656 --> 01:30:49,866
Really, this is too much.

768
01:30:50,658 --> 01:30:52,038
Oh, it's not nearly enough.

769
01:30:55,455 --> 01:30:56,655
Good morning, Dan.

770
01:30:58,333 --> 01:30:59,753
Morning, Constance.

771
01:30:59,834 --> 01:31:00,884
Sepp.

772
01:31:01,503 --> 01:31:06,633
So, I had some furs laying around
and I stuffed them with straw.

773
01:31:06,716 --> 01:31:09,716
You know, something for between him
and the cold floor.

774
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:11,720
Hey, Togo.

775
01:31:11,805 --> 01:31:13,215
I made something for you.

776
01:31:15,558 --> 01:31:16,938
Well, go on. Give it a try.

777
01:31:19,104 --> 01:31:20,114
Go on.

778
01:31:32,242 --> 01:31:34,702
Thank you, Dan.
Have a seat. I'll bring you some coffee.

779
01:31:35,662 --> 01:31:38,672
Uh, no. No, I mean, I'd love to,

780
01:31:38,748 --> 01:31:42,668
but I have my own dogs to attend,

781
01:31:42,752 --> 01:31:44,632
so thank you.

782
01:31:47,257 --> 01:31:48,257
Sepp.

783
01:31:52,762 --> 01:31:53,762
Morning, Dan.

784
01:31:54,597 --> 01:31:56,427
- Knock-knock.
- Hello, Mayor. Come in.

785
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:00,100
That all right, then?

786
01:32:00,186 --> 01:32:01,686
Sepp, thank you so much.

787
01:32:02,856 --> 01:32:04,646
We appreciate
everything you've done for us.

788
01:32:05,734 --> 01:32:07,194
Ever so grateful, Mr. Seppala.

789
01:32:07,277 --> 01:32:08,737
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

790
01:32:23,293 --> 01:32:24,673
No, it's too much.

791
01:32:38,058 --> 01:32:41,558
Hi, Sally. Hello, Dev.
Won't you please come in?

792
01:32:48,485 --> 01:32:50,105
- For me?
- Mm-hmm.

793
01:32:55,658 --> 01:32:56,868
It's Togo.

794
01:32:57,285 --> 01:32:58,365
Thank you.

795
01:32:59,579 --> 01:33:02,079
Father carved it, but I painted it.

796
01:33:02,832 --> 01:33:05,592
Well, it's a brilliant likeness, Sally.
Thank you.

797
01:33:13,635 --> 01:33:15,005
He likes his ears.

798
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:21,140
Another man would be enjoying all this
but not a private man like yourself.

799
01:33:21,226 --> 01:33:22,476
Am I right?

800
01:33:22,894 --> 01:33:24,774
Do you think he stayed warm outside?

801
01:33:24,854 --> 01:33:27,774
I wouldn't have come myself
if not for her insistence.

802
01:33:27,857 --> 01:33:30,527
But she wanted to see him...

803
01:33:32,195 --> 01:33:36,825
and I want to be with her at every moment.

804
01:33:36,908 --> 01:33:37,908
Around the side.

805
01:33:37,992 --> 01:33:40,622
- Top?
- The top.

806
01:33:40,704 --> 01:33:44,624
It's strange. You know, I...
I see her and yet...

807
01:33:45,792 --> 01:33:49,052
I don't know how to describe it,
it's unworldly.

808
01:33:49,671 --> 01:33:50,761
Does that make sense?

809
01:33:52,173 --> 01:33:56,553
Kinda like every moment I'm with her
seems impossible yet...

810
01:33:58,054 --> 01:33:59,144
yet there she is.

811
01:34:05,311 --> 01:34:06,311
Mr. Seppala...

812
01:34:07,564 --> 01:34:08,984
is Togo going to die?

813
01:34:16,406 --> 01:34:18,196
Leonhard. Leonhard.

814
01:34:21,619 --> 01:34:24,659
Um, excuse me.
I have cake for you both so please stay.

815
01:34:24,748 --> 01:34:26,248
- Okay.
- Please.

816
01:34:28,793 --> 01:34:30,803
Leonhard, come back inside and apologize.

817
01:34:30,879 --> 01:34:32,209
They're guests in our home.

818
01:34:32,297 --> 01:34:34,167
Apologize for me.

819
01:34:34,257 --> 01:34:36,797
She meant no ill by it.
She's just a child.

820
01:34:36,885 --> 01:34:38,795
I know. She spoke the truth.

821
01:34:38,887 --> 01:34:40,927
No, don't say that. He's on the mend.

822
01:34:41,014 --> 01:34:43,984
It's not winter lameness.
He doesn't have a bad paw.

823
01:34:44,059 --> 01:34:46,849
You know. You've seen it before.

824
01:34:50,148 --> 01:34:51,648
Well, could another dog have lead?

825
01:34:51,733 --> 01:34:53,153
We'll never know.

826
01:34:53,234 --> 01:34:56,074
Well, I think you should consider a world
where Dev has no child

827
01:34:56,154 --> 01:34:57,494
and I have no husband.

828
01:34:57,572 --> 01:35:00,952
Everything you ever tried to warn me about
has come true.

829
01:35:03,870 --> 01:35:05,250
I have run him to death.

830
01:35:06,831 --> 01:35:07,961
I have.

831
01:35:10,085 --> 01:35:12,085
And I'm not at all prepared.

832
01:36:32,167 --> 01:36:33,287
Be safe.

833
01:36:59,778 --> 01:37:00,898
I have to go.

834
01:37:02,655 --> 01:37:03,865
I have to go to work.

835
01:37:06,326 --> 01:37:07,406
Forgive me.

836
01:37:26,054 --> 01:37:28,644
Togo. Togo! Hey. Come.

837
01:37:42,153 --> 01:37:43,993
Togo! Hey! Come.

838
01:37:44,072 --> 01:37:46,372
Come now.
Togo, come now. Come.

839
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:48,910
Togo! Come. Calm down.

840
01:37:51,287 --> 01:37:52,287
Hike up!

841
01:37:57,460 --> 01:37:58,460
Quiet!

842
01:38:12,308 --> 01:38:15,148
Okay. Hike!

843
01:38:41,338 --> 01:38:42,628
Togo, you want some bacon?

844
01:38:45,091 --> 01:38:46,681
Good boy. Tog...

845
01:38:48,553 --> 01:38:51,063
No! No, no, no, no.
No! Togo! Hey!

846
01:38:51,139 --> 01:38:52,769
Hey! Togo!

847
01:38:55,435 --> 01:38:57,265
Togo! Togo, come!

848
01:39:19,626 --> 01:39:20,786
Togo!

849
01:39:22,921 --> 01:39:24,051
Togo!

850
01:39:35,892 --> 01:39:36,892
Togo!

851
01:39:46,069 --> 01:39:47,359
Whoa!

852
01:40:41,082 --> 01:40:44,042
It was foolish of me
to think Togo would ever be denied.

853
01:40:46,629 --> 01:40:49,129
I always thought he lived for the sled.

854
01:40:50,133 --> 01:40:54,893
When all along, what he lived for was me.

855
01:41:00,769 --> 01:41:02,769
We resumed the trail.

856
01:41:02,854 --> 01:41:05,694
We discovered a walk was as good as a run.

857
01:41:11,196 --> 01:41:14,236
As always, Constance was right.

858
01:41:14,991 --> 01:41:17,451
Togo had the heart of a survivor.

859
01:41:18,578 --> 01:41:21,038
Not the storm of the century,

860
01:41:21,122 --> 01:41:23,582
nor a harrowing serum run could stop him.

861
01:41:26,878 --> 01:41:29,508
He lived out his golden years
with a new job...

862
01:41:31,132 --> 01:41:32,432
father.

863
01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:41,850
For two years he sired pups.

864
01:41:45,522 --> 01:41:48,442
While the lower 48 celebrated Balto,

865
01:41:49,150 --> 01:41:53,660
mushers from all over the world
elbowed to get one of Togo's line.

866
01:41:54,781 --> 01:41:56,871
Kennels from Fairbanks to Maine

867
01:41:56,950 --> 01:42:00,160
bred what came to be known
as Seppala Siberians.

868
01:42:01,287 --> 01:42:05,287
A breed valued for their intelligence,
stamina, courage,

869
01:42:05,375 --> 01:42:10,205
but most of all, their good nature
and uncommon bond with humans.

870
01:42:19,764 --> 01:42:22,274
He left us on a Thursday in December.

871
01:42:28,940 --> 01:42:31,230
Constance and I continued
working with dogs

872
01:42:31,317 --> 01:42:34,237
because if you're around them
long enough...

873
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:35,320
Whoa!

874
01:42:35,405 --> 01:42:36,985
They tend to get under your skin.

875
01:42:38,908 --> 01:42:41,748
And if you're lucky enough
to have known a great one,

876
01:42:42,620 --> 01:42:44,120
they never really leave.

877
01:42:45,749 --> 01:42:48,629
They stay with you as long as you live.

878
01:42:50,003 --> 01:42:51,763
Harnessed to your heart,

879
01:42:51,838 --> 01:42:53,548
giving their all...

880
01:42:59,888 --> 01:43:00,888
Hike!

881
01:43:04,017 --> 01:43:05,267
Always.
