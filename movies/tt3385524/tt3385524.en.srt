2
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,753
So, you'll never guess
who turned up yesterday.

3
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,194
Go on.

4
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,715
- Madelyn.
- Madelyn showed up?

5
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,191
Completely out of the blue.
I haven't seen her in 15 years.

6
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,000
And there she was,
standing on the doorstep,

7
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,798
- all gussied up.
- Ha-ha-ha.

8
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,395
And that's a sight
I thought I'd never see again.

9
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,392
What did she want?

10
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,517
20,000 bucks.

11
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,631
Ha-ha-ha! 20,000 bucks?

12
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,952
15 years of back alimony.
I said, "What alimony?

13
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,555
"When we split up, I gave you
whatever money we had,

14
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,994
"and you took the car.

15
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,434
We agreed, that was that."

16
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,193
Geez, not even Mae asked for that,

17
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,198
and she wanted me to pay
for a chauffeur.

18
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,630
It's because our pictures
are plastered all over town.

19
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,837
Probably some lawyer's bright idea.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,991
Well, in any case, I haven't got it.

21
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,760
Myrtle cleaned me out when we split.

22
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,070
You been down to Tijuana?

23
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,470
- Why you ask?
- We had a few days off.

24
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,199
Well, as a matter of fact,

25
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,078
I did take a little trip down there

26
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,471
with Mysterious Montague,
trying to win some back.

27
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,314
Not entirely successfully, unfortunately.

28
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,357
Hey, when is your contract up?

29
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,158
We should ask for a little more money.

30
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,435
A little more? Are you kidding?

31
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,835
Charlie, Buster, Harold,

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,877
they get ten times what Hal pays us.

33
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,678
Well, they own their own pictures.

34
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,672
Exactly. That's what we're gonna do.

35
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,114
Hey, boys. How's it going?

36
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,873
Georgie. We're going shark fishing.

37
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,156
Mr. Laurel doesn't know it yet,
but he's the bait.

38
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,950
Now, how are we gonna do that?
We're under contract.

39
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,758
We can't just change the terms.

40
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,276
Well, we stick together,
we renegotiate with Hal,

41
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,158
get a bigger slice of the pie.

42
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,834
If that doesn't work,
then we walk and set up on our own.

43
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,714
Oh, I don't know.
I mean, I'd love to own our pictures,

44
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,991
but it just doesn't
seem like the right time.

45
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,514
I've got a lot going on.

46
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,909
This overhead is killing me.

47
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,878
- Hi, Babe. Ha, ha.
- Hello, girls.

48
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,758
Hey, guys, you're wanted on set.

49
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,558
Ah, Burgess, just the man.

50
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,273
Listen, take this to our friend.

51
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,999
Tell him I want it on Bold Venture,

52
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,912
the fourth race at Santa Anita,
on the nose.

53
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,195
There's something in there for you.

54
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,919
Would you do it right away, please?

55
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,151
- It's about to start.
- Okay. Thank you, Mr. Hardy.

56
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,839
You'll be fine, Babe.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,755
Just lay off the horses
and don't get married again.

58
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,957
Oh, I didn't tell you.

59
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,158
- I proposed to Lucille.
- Scripty Lucille?

60
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,311
- Yes.
- Damn.

61
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,118
And she said yes.

62
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,476
Ah. That's great news, Babe.

63
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,392
She needs a head examining, but...

64
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,029
- Ha-ha-ha.
- ...great for you.

65
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,233
Here.

66
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,834
I'm never getting married again.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,752
I'm just gonna find a woman I don't like

68
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,069
and buy her a house.

69
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,833
Ha! That's a good one.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,231
Listen, I can't afford
to fool around with my income,

71
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,597
so don't antagonize Hal,
will you, please?

72
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,751
I don't like to talk about business.

73
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,240
Not when we're working.

74
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,431
I promise I'll be as nice as pie,

75
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,432
- so long as he doesn't show up.
- Heh.

76
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,273
They're ready for us, girls.

77
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,795
What's this? Our rodeos are getting
a lot more interesting.

78
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,430
You know,
I don't miss England one little bit.

79
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,318
- Hello, girls.
- Hi.

80
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,312
- Hello.
- Heh, heh.

81
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,199
Oh, by the way, I've chartered a sailboat

82
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,714
to Catalina this Saturday.

83
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,513
- You want to come?
- Ah...

84
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,672
I gotta work on the gags
for the bar routine.

85
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,919
- Ah, be a lot of nice girls there.
- Yeah?

86
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,675
Miss Myrna Loy will be on board,
among others.

87
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,751
Ah, yeah, well, all right, maybe I'll come.

88
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,911
What are all these Romans doing here?

89
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,435
I don't know.
Maybe there's a sale at the Forum.

90
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,914
You've got a million of 'em, don't you?

91
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,594
Hey, Lucille,
have you got my sides over there?

92
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,876
- Right here, Mr. Horne.
- Thank you.

93
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,474
A sweet for my sweet.

94
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,677
Oh, thank you, Babe.

95
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,351
Listen, let's not talk about leaving.

96
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,511
Let's just try to get ourselves a raise.

97
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,557
- Hey, Jimmie.
- Give you a raise?

98
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,429
He'd rather lower Hollywood,
and that's a Scotsman talking.

99
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,399
- Going for a smoke.
- Heh, heh.

100
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,034
That's it, Stan.

101
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,634
We're through.

102
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,711
I'm throwing the moral clause at you.

103
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,995
Morning, Hal.

104
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,197
Another fight at his place last night.

105
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,795
One of the neighbors sees
Ruthie sock him in the mouth,

106
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,189
so they call the cops.

107
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,959
She found out about Vera.

108
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,794
Yeah, it cost me 500 bucks
to keep it out of the papers,

109
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,712
and that's coming out of your paycheck.

110
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,440
You signed a contract
not to prejudice Hal Roach Studios.

111
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,432
Well, you know all about prejudice.

112
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,829
How's your pal Mussolini,

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,513
the one you were going to go
into business with

114
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,399
before he started bombing
all those poor people in Africa?

115
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,153
You see? All he wants to do is fight.

116
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,719
What are you looking for, Stan?

117
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,955
I'm looking for a fair price

118
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,918
for a Laurel and Hardy picture,
and you know it.

119
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,549
Our pictures sell all around the world,
and we haven't got a dime.

120
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,154
That's because
you keep getting divorced!

121
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,470
No, it's because you're a cheapskate
who got rich off our backs.

122
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,114
- Oh, come on, now, Stan.
- He is.

123
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,351
He's a Cheapskate, a skinflint
and a... and a parvenu.

124
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,670
- A parvenu?
- He thinks, because my contract's up

125
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,150
and yours isn't, that I won't be able
to go anyplace else

126
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,833
and I'll have to take what he's offering.

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,274
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Mr. Roach?

128
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,914
What's a parvenu?

129
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,037
Well, it's someone
who started out with nothing,

130
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,554
got rich but has no class.

131
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,994
Look it up in the dictionary, Hal.

132
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,719
There's a picture of you.

133
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,598
Oh, you think you're
some sort of smart-ass, huh?

134
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,159
Well, guess what. I'm smarter.

135
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,312
Has he told you yet?
We're setting up on our own.

136
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,311
Hal, it might be best

137
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,199
if you could see your way
to a small raise.

138
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,237
You're setting up on your own, huh?

139
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,913
Well, how about this?

140
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,593
Babe's still under contract with me,

141
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,029
and I ain't releasing him.

142
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,998
You can't have Hardy without Laurel.

143
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,151
Oh, well, that's what you think.

144
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,709
Hal, uh, could you maybe
continue this some other time?

145
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,713
Unless you want to pay
for an extra day, of course.

146
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,757
Go ahead, shoot. Go ahead.

147
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,831
Okay, so we're on
a wide two-shot here, Stan,

148
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,956
just like you wanted.

149
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,474
Then I'm gonna pull back...

150
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,119
- What are you checking with him for?
- Well...

151
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,390
You're the director.

152
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,676
- Direct.
- Ugh.

153
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,472
Next person you'll be hearing from
is my lawyer.

154
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,199
Positions, everyone.

155
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,113
Comedy Western.
Who came up with that smart idea?

156
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,198
Well, that went well.

157
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,636
So, uh, who else is
gonna be on this boat?

158
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,870
Clark Gable, some other people.

159
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,633
- No, no, no. Women.
- Oh.

160
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,478
Carole Lombard.
She's friends with Myrna.

161
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,278
Oh. Okay, I'm gonna come.

162
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,397
- Oh, good.
- All right, show's over.

163
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,358
Let's, uh, roll sound.

164
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,796
- I said roll sound.
- Speed.

165
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,030
Roll camera.

166
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,077
- Ready, boys?
- Quiet, please.

167
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,753
"Way Out West," scene 12, take one.

168
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,319
Oh, what's after the curtseys?

169
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,591
Uh, after the curtseys,
knee bend, then turn and shake.

170
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,034
- Got it.
- Camera set.

171
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,599

Whew.

207
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,710
- Oliver.
- Ah, Mr. Delfont.

208
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,234
- Stanley.
- Well, hello there.

209
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,356
- Welcome to England.
- Thank you.

210
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,710
Welcome to Newcastle.
Wonderful to see you.

211
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,711
How was your journey?

212
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,109
Well, you know, that train trip

213
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,634
sure takes it out of you, doesn't it?

214
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,120
Mm-hm.
- Good, good, good, good, good.

215
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,436
Uh, we're delighted
you've taken the trouble

216
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,034
to come and greet us, Mr. Delfont.

217
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,639
Please, call me Bernie.

218
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,632
I want to do everything
I possibly can to make sure

219
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,359
that this tour gets off on the right foot.

220
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,272
Yes, well, that's something
we were hoping to discuss

221
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,839
with you over dinner, actually.

222
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,031
We're a little concerned
that some of the tour dates

223
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,157
are going to be in conflict
with the shooting dates

224
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,674
of this Robin Hood picture we're doing.

225
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,837
I would love to have dinner with you.

226
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,958
Unfortunately,
due at the theater in ten minutes.

227
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,474
- Ah.
- One of my other acts.

228
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,795
Norman Wisdom.

229
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,633
Bright young talent. Blazing.

230
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,440
And we must nurture
the young generation, gentlemen.

231
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,199
I know you both feel as passionately

232
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,589
about that as I do.

233
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,229
- Hmm.
- Anyway, get yourselves settled in.

234
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,113
Charming staff. Charming.

235
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,475
We shall speak anon.

236
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,835
- All righty.
- All right.

237
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,877
- Enjoy the show.
- I shall.

238
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,671
Stan, he does know
we're making a movie, right,

239
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,877
and we're doing this tour
while we're waiting

240
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,434
for things to come together?

241
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,830
Yeah, it's all been spelled out, you know.

242
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,509
All been agreed up front, 110%.

243
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,670
Good.

244
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,230
Where'd you get that?

245
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,438
Uh, it's a... I got it in a shop.

246
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,432
Like a beret, you can fold it up

247
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,598
and stick it in your pocket like that.

248
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,520
Well, here we are.

249
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,234
Well, we'll only be here one night.

250
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,149
Well, three.

251
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,755
Right.

252
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,195
Come on, Stan. Let's get out of the rain.

253
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,159
Good evening, sir.

254
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,392
Now, can't you see
she's standing right there?

255
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,473
You don't need to ring that bell.

256
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,989
Good eve...

257
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,594
That wasn't me.

258
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,879
Please pardon my friend.

259
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,873
You just wait till I tell me mam it's you.

260
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,714
We never get anybody famous
staying here.

261
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,191
To be honest, I thought you'd retired.

262
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,674
- No.No.

263
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,353
No, we're-we're...

264
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,397
we're getting older,
but we're not done yet.

265
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,309
Where are youse
gonna be appearing, then?

266
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,470
The Theatre Royal?

267
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,829
No, it's, uh...

268
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,877
No, it's the Queen's Hall.

269
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,873
Queen's Hall? That can't be right.

270
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,951
All the big stars perform
at the Theatre Royal.

271
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,155
That's where you'll be playing.

272
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,594
Well, I'm sure you're right.

273
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,716
Is it Theatre Royal?

274
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,154
No, it's just the Queen's Hall.

275
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,277
Right, here's your keys.

276
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,800
Thank you.

277
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,190
Now, is there a bellboy?

278
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,189
No-.

279
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,190
All right.

280
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,794
Most of you have realized

281
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,190
it's been a wet and windy day
in Northern England,

282
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,589
as it has been for quite some time...

283
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,991
Oh, uh, my room in ten minutes?

284
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,233
Your room in ten minutes?

285
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,914
Yeah, we've gotta run those lines.

286
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,435
Really?

287
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,069
Sure, we're-we're almost done.

288
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,872
All right. Yeah, I'll be right in.

289
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,310
<i>What's the hotel like?</i>

290
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,950
It's... like a castle.

291
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,833
Well, that's wonderful.

292
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,192
Everyone is so excited
about us touring again

293
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,431
that we're being treated like kings.

294
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,637
Well, Ida and I received our tickets today,

295
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,911
so we're just as excited as can be.

296
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,878
<i>Oh, and so am I.</i>

297
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,999
So, how are things with Stanley?

298
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,833
Well...

299
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,752
you know Stan.

300
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,639
Well, how has he been towards you?

301
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,677
He... he's been good.

302
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,719
It's... it's complicated.

303
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,156
But we're just getting to know
each other again.

304
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,397
It's... it's good.

305
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,471
It's fine.

306
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,509
<i>SCHENCK".
Are you sure Oliver</i>

307
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,711
<i>wants to do this, Stan?</i>

308
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,635
I mean,

309
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,440
Fox would love to have you here, but...

310
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,669
It's what we've both been waiting for, Joe.

311
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,354
I-I can't understand
what's holding him up.

312
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,718
He promised me he was finished
with Hal Roach Studios.

313
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,592
Babe, where have you been?

314
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,518
You had me worried for a minute there.

315
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,034
Ha, ha. What the hell?

316
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,555
You're here now. You're both here now.

317
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,999
Here we are.

318
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,231
Is this gonna be all right?

319
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,994
It's just a movie, Babe.

320
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,550
Mr. Hardy, when you touch her knee
with the mallet,

321
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,757
she'll lift her leg
like you're checking her reflexes.

322
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,433
All right. Thank you.

323
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,113
Want to go for one, you two?

324
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,271
Ready when you are, Ollie.

325
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,958
Going to be great.

326
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,480
Thank you, dear.

327
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,711
You and Harry are
just gonna be great together.

328
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,913
- Roll sound.
- Sound speed.

329
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,639
- Roll camera.
- Camera speed.

330
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,671
Mark it.

331
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,279
"Zenobia," scene 21, take one.

332
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,750
And... action!

333
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,712
Why don't we have Stanley sign?

334
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,836
Then all we have to do

335
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,434
is have Oliver sign when he gets here.

336
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,631
That's-that's a good idea,
right, Joe?

337
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,154
Listen, we need to make sure

338
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,358
we're in a nicer hotel
once the girls get here.

339
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,113
Have you heard from Muffin?

340
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,191
- Miffin.
- Miffin'?

341
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,239
- Is that really his name?
- Mm-hm.

342
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,516
Has he given you our shooting dates yet?

343
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,313
I'm waiting on a call, Ollie.

344
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,949
Hey, what do you think about this
as a title for the movie?

345
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,758
- Hmm?
- "Rob 'Em Good."

346
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,752
As a play on "Robin Hood."

347
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,319
Right.

348
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,352
Yeah, I like it.

349
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,318
I-I've been working on this scene.

350
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,630
Uh, uh, you and I

351
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,030
break into the castle
to rescue Maid Marian.

352
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,949
Right? And we're hiding
from the guards behind a curtain.

353
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,674
Uh, uh, let me show you.

354
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,992
Uh, you're the guard,
and, uh, uh, turn your head away.

355
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,434
Ha-ha-ha. All right.

356
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,078
Okay, so you grab a sword.

357
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,550
Then you try and stab me
through the curtain.

358
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,791
Hold on there. I have to get a sword.

359
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,712
- You see that I'm hiding.
- Yes.

360
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,394
You see by my feet I'm hiding,
so you stab at my head.

361
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,278
Well, you can't hide from me.

362
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,840
- Now what?
- And then you just

363
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,752
grab the drapes
and pull them apart and...

364
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,038
Is that funny?

365
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,835
<i>Why you stay in guest house?</i>

366
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,673
<i>You should be in best hotel.</i>

367
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,672
Beggars can't be choosers, can they?

368
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,275
<i>Okay, then why you not play West End?</i>

369
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,636
No, no, no, no. I don't like this Delfont.

370
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,235
Ida, he booked the tour for us, and we...

371
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,597
we didn't exactly have
too many other offers, now, did we?

372
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,792
And, anyway, we-we have
the movie to look forward to.

373
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,076
<i>I guess the theater's a little small,
but that means</i>

374
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,992
<i>- it'll be easier to sell out.
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.</i>

375
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,993
How is Oliver? Hmm? He pulling weight?

376
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,991
He's fine.

377
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,076
Hello?

378
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,832
Stanley!

379
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,035
Hello.

380
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,395
Hello? Ida?

381
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,312
- Stanley.
- Thank goodness for that.

382
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,517
<i>- Thought I 'd lost you.</i>
- Oy.

383
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,717
Honey, I'm-I'm all out of change.
I gotta go.

384
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,950
Okay, you hang up first.

385
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,956
- No, no. You.
- Okay.

386
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,958
On three. One. Two.

387
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,992
<i>- Three. I love you!</i>
- I <i>love</i> you.

388
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,514
Hello?

389
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,960
Hello, Ollie.

390
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,720
I didn't expect to see you here today.

391
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,678
Well, I didn't have
anything better to do...

392
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,038
...so I thought I'd come and see you.

393
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,269
Thank you.

394
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,115
What have you got there?

395
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,352
I brought you some hard-boiled eggs
and some nuts.

396
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,831
Now, you know
I can't eat hard-boiled eggs and nuts.

397
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,877
If you wanted to bring me something,

398
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,951
why didn't you bring me a box of candy?

399
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,033
Well, you still haven't paid me
for the last box I brought you.

400
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,951
Hard-boiled eggs and nuts.

401
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,514
Mmm!

402
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,989
What's going on out there
with all those empty seats?

403
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,799
H-How's your knee?

404
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,076
It hurts.

405
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,313
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you so very kindly.

406
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,835
We hope you've enjoyed
our little bit of fun here tonight.

407
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,638
We certainly have enjoyed ourselves.

408
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,996
Pretty empty last night.

409
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,111
Pretty empty?

410
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,794
Could have invited
the entire audience back to our hotel,

411
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,832
and there would have been
plenty of room.

412
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,236
Listen, we have to make sure
Muffin doesn't come

413
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,959
until these houses pick up.

414
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,270
We don't want him getting cold feet
about the movie.

415
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,239
Well, then I won't invite him
until we get to London.

416
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,038
All right. You got it?

417
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,999
- Yeah, I got it.
- Here.

418
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,036
What time's our train?

419
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,839
- 8:05.
- What time is it now?

420
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,877
Hold this.

421
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,674
Do we really need that trunk?

422
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,110
How about I just punch you
right on the nose?

423
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,669
I haven't done that for a long time.

424
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,150
Can I poke you in the eye?

425
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,034
You could wring my neck.

426
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,873
I think I'd rather poke you in the eye.

427
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,270
- It's simple.
- Yeah, but if you wring my neck,

428
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,477
I can do that thing with my tongue.

429
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,157
You know, I don't know if my knees

430
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,834
- are gonna hold out for this.
- That's all right.

431
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,270
We'll just finish with a song
instead of the dance.

432
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,078
No, I don't mean the tour.

433
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,119
I mean this scene in the movie
where I fall into the river.

434
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,112
But that's historical, you-you know.
It's famous.

435
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,078
Robin Hood has a fight
on the middle of the log.

436
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,674
We-we gotta do that.

437
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,958
It's a made-up story. Ha-ha.
It's not historical.

438
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,954
All right, look, all I can say is
I'll do the best I can.

439
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,555
Tell you what, I'll have a word
with the producer, Miffin.

440
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,119
I'm sure he can cut round you

441
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,033
when we...
when we shoot the picture.

442
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,080
Maybe I will wring your neck.

443
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,150
Mr. Miffin, please.

444
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,197
It's Stan Laurel.

445
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,956
L-A-U-R-E-L.

446
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,312
That's right.

447
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,279
Oh, that...
well, that's very kind of you to say.

448
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,074
I'm afraid Mr. Hardy's, uh,

449
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,311
indisposed right now.

450
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,233
He's working in a Swiss cheese factory.

451
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,994
He got the job putting the holes in.

452
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,594
S-So, uh, Mr. Miffin?

453
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,910
Is he? All right.

454
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,549
Well, he-he sure does take
a lot of meetings.

455
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,313
It's just that I need to confirm a date

456
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,399
for him to come
and see our show in London.

457
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,313
All right, no, well,
I'll-I'll call again another time.

458
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,198
Thank you.

459
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,712
- How's Ida?
- Oh, she's fine. You know.

460
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,518
She says she's really looking forward

461
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,478
to seeing you and Lucille again.

462
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,472
- Very much.
- Good.

463
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,154
Oh, I... I got you something.

464
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,391
Oh.

465
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,552
Here, hold onto this. Ha-ha.

466
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,595
How do I look?

467
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,034
- You look swell.
- Ha, ha.

468
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,951
We're two peas in a pod.

469
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,519
<i>We just want to know</i>

470
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,637
who's playing Laurel and Hardy, please.

471
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,030
- They're playing themselves.
- Who are?

472
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,396
Laurel and Hardy, here in person.

473
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,710
The poster says,
they're-they're here in person.

474
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,473
But they've been retired for years.

475
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,836
- They're playing themselves.
- Good afternoon, folks.

476
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,399
- Look, Mammy.
- Hello.

477
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,392
Oh, ma'am, I-if you're buying tickets,

478
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,994
tell them you're friends of ours.

479
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,559
He'll charge you extra.

480
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,677
Two seats, front row.

Mmm. The eternal mysteries
of Scottish cuisine.

492
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,950
- Hmm.
- Ever had haggis, Oliver?

493
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,519
No-.

494
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,353
Don't.

495
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,671
Now, then, gentlemen,
can I just say, terrific show.

496
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,989
Absolutely terrific.

497
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,480
- Thank you. Yeah.
- Thank you.

498
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,353
- I couldn't be happier.
- Well, let me tell you.

499
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,233
We're going to be working
in some new material.

500
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,674
- Right, Stan?
- Ooh.

501
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,717
Yeah, we have a double-door routine,

502
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,394
um, set in a railway station,
and when Babe's leg is better,

503
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,959
we're going to reintroduce
the dance routine.

504
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,838
Yes, and I think
that will all help enormously.

505
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,560
Double-door routine...
audiences will love that.

506
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,916
How do you feel about
the size of the audiences?

507
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,993
To be honest,
I've been a little disappointed.

508
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,520
And I think it's because of

509
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,717
all these small theaters
we've been playing.

510
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,110
Yes, and I am absolutely furious
about that.

511
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,635
All due respect, Bernard,
you picked them.

512
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,154
Now, I-l don't know what happened

513
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,833
with the larger theaters
we were talking about...

514
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,389
Well, they said they were all booked up.

515
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,392
Yeah, by Norman Wisdom.

516
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,790
Uh, isn't he one of your acts?

517
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,315
Boys, the last thing I want to do
is start canceling shows.

518
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,198
Wait, wait. Who's talking
about canceling shows?

519
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,395
Not me.

520
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,159
Well, we've only been at it a week.

521
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,709
Yeah, wh-when do you plan
to finish this tour?

522
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,110
Well, if we wrap things up
before we get to London,

523
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,873
that would give us
another ten shows or so.

524
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,838
And with a bit of a push, you know,

525
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,399
final shows, that sort of thing,

526
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,597
we should be able to go out with a bang.

527
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,273
- In Hull.
- No. Wait, no.

528
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,839
- Hull?
- We have this movie producer

529
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,389
coming to our show
in London in a month.

530
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,880
- Isn't that right, Stan?
- That's right.

531
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,151
And Ida and Lucille, they're flying over.

532
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,960
We can't finish
the show before London.

533
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,952
- Bernard, we've been clear
- Mm-hm.

534
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,918
That the only reason
we were doing this tour

535
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,435
was so we could pull
that Robin Hood picture together.

536
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,159
- That's right.
- Boys, boys, I know you're peeved,

537
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,630
but could I just say, I am furious.

538
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,393
I mean, they said,
"Oh, people don't come

539
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,920
to the theater anymore."

540
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,559
They said, "They just stay at home

541
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,677
"watching their new television sets,
or they go

542
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,955
"and watch Laurel and Hardy reruns

543
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,679
- at the local picture house."
- We don't get paid

544
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,672
- for those reruns, you know?
- That's what I said,

545
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,194
and then they said, "Could you persuade

546
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,913
"Stan and Ollie to do some publicity

547
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,479
in order to turn the tour around?"

548
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,677
Heh, heh. And I said, "lf you think

549
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,274
"that I'm gonna ask Laurel and Hardy

550
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,272
"to do some publicity stunts,
then you, my friend,

551
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,670
are sorely mistaken."

552
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,479
Hold on. Hold on, now.

553
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,031
We could do that,
couldn't we, Stan?

554
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,430
Sure, if you feel up to it, Babe.

555
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,159
Sure.

556
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,754
It would mean a very large amount

557
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,399
of extra work for you both,

558
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,119
making public appearances,
shop openings,

559
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,476
meeting local dignitaries,
so on and so forth.

560
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,194
- Would there be any more money?
- Ugh. They said no.

561
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,873
Uh, who is "they"?

562
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,156
People. The worst kind.

563
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,391
Wait, I-I thought you were in charge.

564
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,120
Ha-ha. So did I. Heh-heh-heh.

565
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,116
- All right, we'll do it.
- Terrific.

566
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,078
Well, I've told the press
and the newsreel boys

567
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,470
that there'll be a welcoming committee
in Carlisle.

568
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,472
Lord Mayor will be there.
He's desperate to see you.

569
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,711
He is a huge fan.
I'll make some calls.

570
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,638
Delicious.

571
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,871
<i>Nothing new
about a couple of funnymen</i>

572
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,269
<i>making personal appearances.</i>

573
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,839
<i>But when Laurel and Hardy do it,</i>

574
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,560
<i>you can expect complications.</i>

575
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,271
<i>But even at a moment like this,</i>

576
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,313
<i>trouble just seems to follow them around.</i>

577
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,438
Oh!

578
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,160
- What's the matter?
- My head hurts.

579
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,072
I'll get a doctor.

580
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,117
Oh!

581
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,432
Never mind the doctor.
Just get my glass of water.

582
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,431
Oh!

583
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,999
Unbelievable.

584
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,315
It certainly is.

585
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,390
Sorry to bother you, chaps.

586
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,029
Mr. Delfont would like to speak to you.

587
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,840
Uh-oh.

588
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,037
Any last words?

589
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,798
Evening, gentlemen.

590
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,792
If it's, uh, all right with you,

591
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,997
I'd quite like to have
a discussion about...

592
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,753
where we go from here.

593
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,594
Let me guess. Back to America?

594
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,478
Oblivion?

595
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,190
That was...

596
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,597
It was pure magic.

597
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,795
It was brilliant.

598
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,918
And ticket sales have improved
over the last week so much,

599
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,760
mainly due to your efforts,

600
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,792
we've sold out almost everywhere.

601
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,149
Uh, what about London?

602
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,436
Well, not only are we going to London,

603
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,238
but so many people want
to come see the show

604
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,311
that I've had to look for a bigger theater.

605
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,279
So I've, uh... I've booked
the Lyceum for two weeks.

606
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,238
We're guaranteed to sell it out.

607
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,799
That's-that's over 2,000 seats.

608
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,871
- Indeed.
- Heh, heh. Wow.

609
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,269
Do you know, it's moments like this

610
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,800
that make me love this industry.

611
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,030
Madness.

612
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,396
It's beautiful madness. Heh.

613
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,030
And it's not about the money.
It is not about the money.

614
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,310
I swear on...

615
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,879
Well, I swear on both your lives.

616
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,713
Ahem. You both feeling all right'?

617
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,597
That's... that's pretty good, yeah.

618
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,831
- Yeah, leave the jokes to us.
- All right.

619
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,558
Seriously, though,
it's a very special evening.

620
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,838
- Thank you, Bernie.
- Thank you.

621
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,591
Well, that went well.

622
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,194
It certainly did.

623
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,313
So, you're on the log with Robin Hood,

624
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,790
and he asks you what you want
to see him about,

625
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,280
and then you say...

626
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,750
"We're going to give him
a piece of my mind."

627
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,115
"We certainly are."

628
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,112
"We'd give him a piece of his, too,

629
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,918
but he doesn't have any to spare."

630
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,674
Heh, heh. Yeah, that's a nice line.

631
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,114
Have you reached this Muffin fella yet?

632
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,551
I mean,
I'm enjoying how the show's going,

633
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,400
but it's the movie we're doing it for,
isn't it?

634
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,829
Well, that's right, the...

635
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,640
you know, one thing leads to another.

636
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,552
Well, I sure hope so. Heh.

637
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,838
Not exactly spring chickens anymore,
are we?

638
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,197
London terminus, next and final stop.

639
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,391
All change.

640
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,515
Well, here we are.

641
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,513
There it is, the Eiffel Tower.

642
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,029
Ah, here we are.

643
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,029
That's the one.

644
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,634
- Look at that. That's wonderful.
- Yeah.

645
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,837
- It's-it's a beautiful piece, sir.
- Hmm.

646
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,634
Mr. Laurel not with you today?

647
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,196
Oh, no, he got himself
a new job mending broken biscuits.

648
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,754
I think it's wonderful you're still going.

649
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,557
Well, rigor mortis has not set in yet.

650
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,358
Sir, he's ready to see you now.

651
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,239
- If you'd like to come along with me...
- Thank you.

652
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,717
Good morning.

653
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,837
Uh, I'm here to see Mr. Miffin.

654
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,317
- And your name, please?
- Uh, Mr. Laurel.

655
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,356
Do you have an appointment,
Mr. Lauren?

656
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,433
Well, no, we keep missing
each other on the telephone,

657
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,069
so I thought if I dropped by,
that'd be the easiest thing.

658
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,151
'Cause he's not here right now.

659
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,155
Well, I can wait.

660
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,957
I think I-I've been speaking
to a different girl on...

661
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,679
on the telephone about this.

662
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,354
Uh, I've been speaking to her
for quite some time.

663
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,511
She's left.

664
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,717
Has she?

665
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,876
You sure you want to wait?
He might be quite a while.

666
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,719
Well, I'm here now, aren't I?

667
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,951
Take a seat over there, Mr. Lauren.

668
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,795
- Laurel. <i>- I'll</i>
let his office know that you're here.

669
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,237
There's a gentleman here
says his name's Mr. Lauren.

670
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,958
Right.

671
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,156
You know,
now that I see these two together,

672
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,759
I-I almost prefer this one.

673
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,070
It's our finest bracelet.

674
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,669
My wife is coming in from America today.

675
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,638
It'll be a gift for her.

676
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,110
- 350 pounds.
- Oh.

677
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,914
Let me just double-check something
real quick here.

678
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,994
Uh... do-do-do-do-da.

679
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,750
Ah, yes.

680
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,550
I wonder if you could hold
onto this for me.

681
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,673
I-I seem to have brought
the wrong wallet with me.

682
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,990
So I'll just tootle back to the hotel

683
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,992
and be right back tout de suite.

684
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,275
Of course, sir.

685
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,310
<i>Hello, Raymond?</i>

686
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,875
Well, I was wondering
if you could speak to your man

687
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,077
and-and... and place a bet for me.

688
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,753
Well, I'll tell you.

689
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,391
It's Hometown Boy at Kempton,
the 2:30, five to one.

690
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,959
Um...

691
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,316
let-let's make it 60.

692
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,118
60 pounds on the nose.

693
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,996
Hello? Can I help you?

694
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,151
Sorry. I have asked you to wait.

695
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,879
Please, you're not allowed in there!

696
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,758
Miss Clarke!

697
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,673
Mr. Lauren's in Mr. Miffin's office!

698
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,758
You're here to see Mr. Miffin?

699
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,309
Yes, uh, I'm sorry, uh...

700
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,675
uh, yes, I am.

701
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,753
I'm his production executive,
Cynthia Clarke.

702
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,480
- Hello, Cynthia.
- Oh.

703
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,951
Mr. Miffin is still detained,

704
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,958
but I've just spoken to him
on the telephone,

705
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,515
and he wanted me
to explain the situation to you.

706
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,036
He says he's sorry,
but he's been unable

707
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,114
to raise the finance needed
to proceed with the film.

708
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,591
Oh, I-l see.

709
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,872
He said he made it clear
in a cable he sent to you

710
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,633
before you left the United States

711
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,316
that all the finance wasn't in place.

712
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:26,392
Yes, well, I thought
he'd have it all lined up by now.

713
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,435
He wanted you to know
that he did everything he could

714
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,318
to bring the project together,

715
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,118
but he feels sure you'll understand

716
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,436
that the market is very challenging
at the moment

717
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,399
and it simply wasn't possible.

718
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,993
Yes, well... thank you.

719
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,436
Uh, thank you for your time.

720
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,954
<i>Get The Sporting Times.</i>

721
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,473
<i>The Sporting Times, please.</i>

722
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,677
There you are. Thank you.

723
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,919
Get "The Sporting Times."

724
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,510
- Bye-bye, now, kids.
- Bye-bye.

725
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,630
- Oh, what's all this here?
- Oh.

726
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,359
- All right, gents.
- Hi, boys.

727
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,397
- Good afternoon, Mr. Hardy.
- Delfont's idea.

728
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,039
He... he thought that the girls arriving

729
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,271
would be a good excuse
for some free publicity.

730
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,475
Ah.

731
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,950
Hmm. I'm really looking forward
to seeing them.

732
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,396
Oh, I've been counting the days.

733
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,359
46. Since we got here.

734
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,840
46 days.

735
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,559
46? Heh, heh.

736
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,757
Who counts from 46?

737
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,149
I was missing her.

738
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,958
Hey, I've been thinking.

739
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,758
We don't need to tell the girls

740
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,319
about everything
we've been doing, do we?

741
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,914
- Um, no.
- I don't want to mention

742
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,957
these personal appearances
and the drinking.

743
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,634
Uh, no, th-there's no sense
in getting them all worked up.

744
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,509
We'll just talk about how well
the tour's going and the movie.

745
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,874
Sure, and the movie.

746
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,709
Hey, if the car pulls up here,

747
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,877
do you think
we could do the door routine?

748
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,509
Heh. You just never stop, do you?

749
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,830
- Ooh, here they are.
- Here they are. Okay.

750
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,196
There she is. Oh...

751
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,633
- Hey, sweetie pie.
- Hello.

752
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,120
Hi, Stan.

753
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,918
Hey, girls, will you
both get out this side?

754
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,514
I've got something I want you to do.

755
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,159
Of course, darling.
I give them my good side.

756
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,674
Oh, no, Stanley, we just got here.

757
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,194
- Come on, girls.
- Oh...

758
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,152
<i>Comedy duo Laurel and Hardy</i>

759
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,512
<i>were joined in London this week
by their wives.</i>

760
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,910
<i>But even in a simple situation like this,</i>

761
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,516
<i>trouble has a habit
of following them around.</i>

762
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,353
<i>Oliver Hardy, Bachelor of Arts,</i>

763
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,751
<i>always seems to have things
under control.</i>

764
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:34,240
<i>But somehow,
things never quite work out that way.</i>

765
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,477
<i>Yes, they're reunited again,</i>

766
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,838
<i>and now everyone can start
making up for lost time.</i>

767
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,194
Well, I hope they got all that.

768
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,794
It's fine. It'll get a laugh.

769
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,951
Oh, well, I'm awfully glad
about that, boys,

770
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,509
but it would have been nice
to say hello to my husband

771
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,830
without immediately being pressed
into one of your skits.

772
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,798
Oh, Lord. It was just small fun.

773
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,598
Oh, is that what it was, Ida?

774
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,831
Don't be cross, angel.

775
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,832
Who knows?
Maybe you'll get discovered.

776
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,514
They could say,
"She ought to be in pictures."

777
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,159
Heh. No. No, no, no, I don't...

778
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,197
I don't think so, no.

779
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,912
Oliver, can we visit the Tower of London

780
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,150
and Saint Paul's?

781
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,515
- Oh, and Harrods?
- Of course.

782
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,034
Oh, and Buckingham Palace,

783
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,350
where that darling new queen lives.

784
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,796
Of course, angel.
You can visit anywhere you like.

785
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,792
No, no, no,
Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg.

786
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,439
- Oh, this is palace.
- Mm-hm.

787
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,995
The Buckingham is little doghouse.

788
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,878
We have been

789
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,633
counting the days until you got here.

790
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,632
- Oh.
- All 46 of them.

791
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,235
- Did you know it was 46, Stan?
- Heh.

792
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,875
How's the movie coming along, Stanley?

793
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,633
Oh, it's, uh... it's all set up

794
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,552
- for when we finish the tour.
- Oh.

795
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,757
There's this producer fella named Muffin.

796
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,955
Miffin.

797
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,470
And, uh, Stan has rewritten his script.

798
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,392
Oliver, that's enough salt.

799
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,789
You know it's bad
for your blood pressure.

800
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,798
Oh, sorry, angel, just a force of habit.

801
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,479
Anyway, this producer is set to come by

802
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,313
and see the show sometime next week.

803
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,834
Isn't that right, Stan?

804
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,195
Yeah, he said he'd-he'd try
and get along. Mm.

805
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,874
Stan has been
taking wonderful care of me

806
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,351
and making sure
that Daddy takes all of his tablets.

807
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,994
Has he been taking
the blue ones, Stanley?

808
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,436
Blue ones? I... I've been
giving him green ones.

809
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,114
Green? Oh, my goodness.
Oliver, what are they?

810
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,640
- He's kidding.
- Heh, heh, heh.

811
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,199
Well, I'm not finding that funny.

812
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,676
- I was dancer. Yes?
- Oh.

813
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,478
I dance for Preston Sturges.

814
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,597
- I dance for Harold Lloyd.
- Really, Ida?

815
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,114
You've never mentioned this before.

816
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,840
When my knee hurt,
what I do, hmm?

817
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,031
I dance some more, yes?

818
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,591
I go faster, I jump high,
and hurt go away.

819
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,592
- Oh. Mm.
- Hmm? I forget pain,

820
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,314
because pain is only in your mind, Oliver.

821
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,278
It's not in his mind, Ida.
It's in his knee.

822
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,636
And there's no way that you can do
the scene in this movie

823
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,199
where you fall into the river.

824
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,636
- I've been telling her about the script.
- Oh.

825
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,191
- Director can use double.
- That's what I told her.

826
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,634
- Sturges use double.
- It's okay

827
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,029
for Babe to sit about in a river all day,

828
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,270
is it, catching his death of cold?

829
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,515
Honestly, Stanley, come on.

830
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,239
Why you say Stanley?

831
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,714
- What?
- What?

832
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,599
Anyway, show must go on, yes?

833
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,875
And don't worry about river jump.

834
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,758
It's easy as cake.

835
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,196
- Easy as pie.
- Yeah, it's-it's a piece of cake.

836
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,237
That's what I say.

837
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,834
What do you see
in a fat old man like me'?

838
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,999
Hey, you, that's my husband
you're talking about.

839
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,200
I love you, and you can't stop me.

840
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,075
- Well, all right.
- Mmm.

841
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,917
How was the trip over with Ida?

842
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,356
Oh, you know Ida. Exhausting.

843
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,431
When she gets something in her head,

844
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,513
she won't let it go
till she's worried it to death,

845
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,398
and God forbid anyone should raise

846
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,278
the slightest criticism of Stanley.

847
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,272
Heh, heh. She's a real piece of work.

848
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,078
Yeah.

849
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,719
Has he been pushing you
a little too hard, Babe?

850
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,518
No-.

851
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,591
I mean, it is a bit more difficult

852
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,350
than I thought it might be, but...

853
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,915
the show must go on.

854
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,109
I think she wear pants
in Hardy house, no?

855
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,114
Oliver is like cat
on hot roof with Lucille.

856
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,879
Babe's been like that with all his wives.

857
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,360
He runs round after them,

858
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,193
jumping up and down,
trying to please them.

859
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,873
Oh, you can learn this?

860
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,038
She's been good for him,

861
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,430
considering the state he was in.

862
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,796
The state we were both in.

863
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,396
But now we don't drink
and we don't smoke,

864
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,154
and we're very happy-

865
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,952
He should say thank you to you
for all you do for him.

866
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,909
You could have long time ago said,
"Goodbye, Oliver."

867
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:01,153
That's all in the past,
and it's where it should stay.

868
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,032
Thank you.

869
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,919
You crazy. Send it back.

870
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,673
I don't want to drink it.
I just want to smell it.

871
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,160
No, it's bad for diabetes.

872
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,839
No-.

873
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,791
Now you can't drink.

874
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,318
I don't want to lose you, Stanley.

875
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,713
Mmm.

876
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,675
And to think nobody knows
that you're really a man.

877
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,634
Would you like me to arrange
you tickets for Norman Wisdom?

878
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,154
Oh, I don't know who that is.

879
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,072
Oh, one of the comic minds
of our generation.

880
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,469
Oh, well, that's wonderful.

881
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,869
<i>- I'll</i> speak to Oliver.
- Absolutely.

882
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,519
- Yea high, cap. After you.
- Thank you. Oh.

883
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,994
- Mm-mm. No, no, no. No, no.
- What?

884
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,673
No, I don't want to sit next to him.

885
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:18,989
- Hello. Hello.
- Evening.

886
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,156
Sold out. Wonderful.

887
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,833
Huge box office.

888
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,389
- Who?
- They sold a lot of tickets, Ida.

Why don't you ask someone
to go get them, hmm?

924
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,479
Well, he seems a little preoccupied

925
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,074
with his fancy friends.

926
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,072
Come, we stand like lemon, huh?

927
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,514
Oh, Ida.

928
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,474
Hello.

929
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,358
Ladies, I was just on my way over.

930
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,794
Mrs. Laurel and Mrs. Hardy,

931
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,359
may I introduce Lord and Lady Warley

932
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,510
and Mr. and Mrs. Brockett-Smith.

933
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,114
- Hello.
- Good evening.

934
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,873
Such a wonderful reception,
isn't it, Ida?

935
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,390
- It's okay.
- Did you enjoy the show?

936
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,279
Oh, yes, very good.
Stuff and nonsense, wasn't it?

937
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,511
Well, Mr. Delfont, he told us that...

938
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,559
I have many offer
to perform on London stage,

939
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,558
but Hollywood call me.

940
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,274
Oh, so you're a bit
of an actress yourself, are you?

941
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:47,478
More of a dancer, really,
with a very high pain threshold.

942
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,718
I make film with, uh,
Preston Sturges and, urn...

943
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:51,995
- Harold Lloyd.
- Harold Lloyd.

944
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,434
No time for London stage.

945
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,273
No, and I'm sure the London stage

946
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,232
has been kicking itself all these years.

947
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,716
- Oh, yes.
- Yes.

948
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,153
We have to find our boys.

949
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,839
Excuse me.

950
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,551
Two double acts for the price of one.

951
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,634
This line that Robin Hood has

952
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,871
about stealing from the rich
and giving to the poor,

953
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,878
th-there's a gag there somewhere,
isn't there?

954
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,196
Babe, the girls are gonna be waiting
for us downstairs.

955
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,476
Delfont wants us to meet
these people from his charity.

956
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,109
No, never mind about them.
They're not going anywhere.

957
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,840
We just need to work through this
just a little bit more.

958
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,469
Hey, when is Muffin coming
to see the show?

959
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,269
He didn't say.

960
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,670
He should have been here tonight.
Went big tonight.

961
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,194
That was a crackerjack, wasn't it?

962
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,680
- Ha, ha, ha.
- It was.

963
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,751
All right, all right, how-how about this?

964
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,800
How about we tell Robin Hood,
"You've got it all wrong.

965
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,758
"You ought to steal from the poor

966
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,752
- and give it to the rich."
- No, no, that's not...

967
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,479
- Something like that.
- That's not right, it's...

968
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,153
- Well, what is it?
- Well, all-all right, okay.

969
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,390
- You got something...
- How about...

970
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,073
Okay, how about this?
Okay, I tap you

971
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,629
on the shoulder, and I say, uh, uh...

972
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,234
"Ollie, I got an idea.

973
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,391
"How about we-we give to the poor

974
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,915
"by stealing from the poor?

975
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,673
That way, we cut out the middleman."

976
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,029
That's it.

977
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,793
- Ha. That's it.
- All right.

978
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,759
Stealing from the rich to give to the poor.

979
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,991
Whoever heard
of such a ridiculous idea?

980
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,753
Well, it's communism.

981
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,672
Stanley,
he is not gonna fall into that river.

982
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,478
The script says I fall in the river,

983
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,119
- that's what I have to do.
- No, Oliver.

984
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,032
- It's historical, right, Stan?
- It is, yes.

985
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,918
I can't believe we have to see
all these people.

986
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,195
I just want to take a bath.

987
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,754
Yeah, I want you to take a bath.

988
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,558
- Heh, heh.
- Ah.

989
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,994
There you are.

990
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,350
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Stan Laurel

991
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,557
and Mr. Oliver Hardy.

992
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,640
No-.

993
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,120
- Yeah?
- No, I-l don't want any.

994
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,156
- Oh.
- Thank you, no.

995
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,594
I got a great thing going here.

996
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,558
The... the more I drink,
the drunker she gets.

997
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,913
- Do loosen up, angel.
- Yes, loosen.

998
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,071
This movie could be big break for boys.

999
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,151
Oh, please. A big break?

1000
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,072
Oliver is 61 years old.

1001
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,958
- He's made 150 films, Ida.
- Shh.

1002
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,713
Please tell me, how can they be

1003
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,030
a matter of weeks away
from making this movie, Stanley,

1004
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,952
and still not have
any shooting dates confirmed?

1005
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,714
I mean, this is just such
a ridiculous situation.

1006
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:03,950
It may be ridiculous,

1007
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,269
but situation's not Stanley's fault.

1008
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,635
- Honey, that's the...
- What?

1009
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,313
Please, w-we're here to have a nice time.

1010
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,312
Well, whose fault is it, then, Ida?

1011
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,039
- What are you trying to insinuate?
- Oh, come on, now.

1012
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,356
No. No, no, no.
I'd like to know how this nutty tour...

1013
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,397
which, let's face it,
they're doing for the money...

1014
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,278
has anything to do with Oliver.

1015
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,198
Because Oliver make elephant film.

1016
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,275
What?

1017
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,594
- Gentlemen.
- What?

1018
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,950
May I present two huge fans of yours,

1019
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,997
Lord Angus and Lady Mary Warley.

1020
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,197
Ladies, I'm being the most terrible host.

1021
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,556
Shall we sample the delights
of the buffet?

1022
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,280
My wife loves your films.

1023
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,596
I-I don't really watch them myself.

1024
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,114
I remember one about a piano.

1025
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,191
You two had to push it up some stairs.

1026
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,913
Have you seen that one?

1027
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,230
- No.
- Oh, it's very good.

1028
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,357
They had to push this piano
up to the top of the stairs,

1029
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,840
and it was a long way, hmm?

1030
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,957
And you got it up to the top of the stairs,

1031
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,719
and the bloody thing came sliding

1032
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,757
- all the way down to the bottom again.
- Hmm, hmm.

1033
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,270
And you two had to push it
all the way back up.

1034
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,158
- I know. I was there.
- And would you believe,

1035
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,038
it only rolled all the way down again.

1036
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,909
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Yes, that's what happened.

1037
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,233
Was the piano damaged?

1038
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,913
- It was a prop.
- No, it was a...

1039
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,832
Would you please excuse us
for a moment?

1040
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,230
- Oh.
- J-Just one moment.

1041
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,670
- That was painful.
- Yeah.

1042
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,593
What was that Ida just said
about the elephant film?

1043
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,671
You're not still carrying that around,
are you?

1044
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,751
No, it was just... you know, I like to

1045
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,672
let off steam now and again, but she's...

1046
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,229
she didn't know what she was saying.

1047
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,592
You think this is all my fault

1048
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,671
because I went ahead
and did a picture

1049
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,239
with someone else 16 years ago?

1050
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,515
Is that what you think?

1051
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,794
You weren't there anymore.

1052
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,469
- You left the studio.
- I was fired.

1053
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,917
Because you were
a pain in the ass, Stan.

1054
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,230
You refused to negotiate with Hal.

1055
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,754
I was still under contract,

1056
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,797
so I had to do that picture without you.

1057
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:59,430
Well, that's, uh...
that's not how I see it.

1058
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,755
And how do you see it, Stan?

1059
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,150
Well, if we're laying
all our cards on the table,

1060
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,596
the-the only reason
we're in this situation now

1061
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,718
is because when I was trying
to get a better deal from Hal,

1062
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,154
you were nowhere to be seen.

1063
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,590
I had no choice, and you know it.

1064
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,592
- I was broke.
- You had a choice.

1065
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,718
You chose to be down
at the-the country club or the racetrack.

1066
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,076
We had a good thing going with Hal,

1067
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,356
but you had this big chip
on your shoulder

1068
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,511
because you weren't
being treated like Chaplin.

1069
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,069
You're damn right.
And you didn't have the guts

1070
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,231
to ask for the deal that we deserved.

1071
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,073
I'm getting a drink.

1072
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,072
But, look, Ida, I don't want to fight.

1073
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,958
I just want to do what's best for Babe.

1074
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,236
- Oliver agreed to tour, no?
- Well, yes, he did. He did.

1075
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,674
Okay, so life is not easy.

1076
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,558
It never ever come on dinner plate.

1077
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,870
Are you implying
that Oliver and I aren't hard-working?

1078
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,474
You live in Hollywood.

1079
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,119
- So do you and Stan.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1080
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,954
I may live in Hollywood,
but I am not Hollywood.

1081
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,509
Ida, you are the epitome of Hollywood.

1082
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,194
- Don't you pity me.
- What? Oh.

1083
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,158
I work my entire life to get where I am.

1084
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,834
- Well, hey, I had a job.
- Yeah, poo-poo, script lady.

1085
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,354
Well, how's your
acting career these days?

1086
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,351
- No.
- Yes.

1087
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,874
If you're accusing me

1088
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,913
of trying to get along with people,
well, then I'm guilty.

1089
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,720
I'm an actor. I do like people to like me.

1090
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,274
I want people to hire me.

1091
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,397
Sure, you wouldn't say "boo" to a goose.

1092
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,959
Everybody loves Babe.

1093
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,191
Come and play a round with Babe.

1094
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,079
While I'm sleeping on a couch
in the editing suite.

1095
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,878
Well, that's how you wanted it.

1096
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,190
You cared about those things. I didn't.

1097
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,953
Well, you can't have, or you wouldn't

1098
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,758
have gone off to work
with somebody else.

1099
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,514
L-I couldn't sleep for days
when they told me what you did.

1100
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,671
And I couldn't sleep when I did it.

1101
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,670
But you Still did it.

1102
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,918
You betrayed me,
betrayed our friendship.

1103
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,918
Friendship?

1104
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,873
We're friends
because Hal Roach put us together,

1105
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,991
and the only reason we stayed together

1106
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,912
was because the audience wanted it.

1107
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,997
I have real friends.

1108
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,835
And yes, we play golf,
and we go to ball games,

1109
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,753
and we have sauerkraut
on our bratwurst.

1110
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,070
People will remember our movies

1111
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,312
long after you've finished your hot dog.

1112
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,591
You know something,
you're just a lazy ass

1113
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,876
who got lucky 'cause you met me.

1114
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,360
Lucky?

1115
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,636
To spend my life with a hollow man

1116
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,871
who hides behind his typewriter?

1117
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,149
You're not real, Stan.

1118
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:24,836
You're hollow. You're empty.

1119
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,916
I loved us.

1120
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:37,675
You loved Laurel and Hardy,
but you never loved me.

1121
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,152
So what?

1122
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,312
Bravo!

1123
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,151
Was that funny?

1124
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,710
What are you gonna say to him?

1125
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,278
Nothing.

1126
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,553
There's nothing to say.

1127
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:40,633
Oliver, I would go
to the ends of the earth for you,

1128
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,474
I would do anything for you,
but I won't stand by

1129
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:47,634
and watch this lifestyle of yours
put you in a wooden box.

1130
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,874
There, I've said it.

1131
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,435
I'm sorry, but it's true.

1132
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,877
You know what?

1133
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,400
You're absolutely right.

1134
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,714
Just as soon as we're finished up here,

1135
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,076
that's it.

1136
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,436
I'm through with him.

1137
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,916
Once and for all.

1138
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,591
Oh, Babe.

1139
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:30,439
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.
- Shh. Oh, Babe.

1140
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,030
Good morning.

1141
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,077
Your taxi's outside, Mr. Laurel.

1142
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:48,992
Have you seen Mr. Hardy at all?

1143
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,276
He left about 15 minutes ago, sir.

1144
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,673
Thank you.

1145
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,673
There you are.

1146
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,712
Morning.

1147
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,713
Welcome to Worthing, gentlemen.

1148
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,110
- Can I get you anything?
- If you don't mind,

1149
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,231
I would love a cup of tea, please.

1150
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,834
- Of course.
- I'll do it.

1151
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,354
I'd rather you made my cup of tea,

1152
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:51,999
if that's all right.

1153
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,510
- Of course.
- Thank you.

1154
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,796
Um, how do you take it?

1155
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,389
Milk, four sugars.

1156
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,840
Milk and four sugars, please.

1157
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,559
Of course.

1158
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:16,955
Ahh.

1159
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,754
Thank you very kindly.

1160
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,720
Well, I think it's amazing

1161
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:27,871
that you two are still going strong,

1162
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:30,600
still using the same old material.

1163
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,433
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1164
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,274
Uh, I, uh, wanted to tell you something.

1165
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,875
So, I was talking to this fella
about, uh... about eggs.

1166
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,519
I know you like your eggs.

1167
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,591
And, uh, he said they get a powder

1168
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,871
to supplement the government ration.

1169
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:52,078
You get a packet a month,
same as a dozen eggs.

1170
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,516
Doesn't taste too good, but, uh,

1171
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,234
you can make an omelet with it.

1172
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:59,315
That's what he said.

1173
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,160
Stan, I have nothing to say.

1174
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,870
Well, I've got nothing to say to you, too.

1175
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:07,678
And you can ignore what I just said,

1176
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:08,955
because I won't be repeating it.

1177
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,236
Right. Enough bits.

1178
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,039
Ah, forget it.

1179
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,231
To present the crown

1180
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,711
to the winner
of the Bathing Beauty Contest,

1181
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,838
Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy.

1182
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,639
Thank you. Aren't-aren't they...

1183
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,319
aren't they beautiful?

1184
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,835
Ladies and gentlemen, uh,
Mr. Hardy and myself

1185
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,959
would like to thank you
for such a warm, warm welcome

1186
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:40,350
we've received here
from everyone in-in Worthing,

1187
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:42,756
our favorite seaside town.

1188
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,957
And, uh, really,
I-I suppose all that remains

1189
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:55,317
is for me to put this lovely tiara crown

1190
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,357
on our beautiful winner.

1191
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,399
Will you... will you quit sulking
and get up here?

1192
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,880
And the winner...

1193
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,313
Babe, you're not...
Babe, Babe, what happened?

1194
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,515
You all right?

1195
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,432
What's going on?
What's going on, buddy?

1196
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,432
Uh, someone turned out the lights.

1197
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,834
Talk to me.

1198
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,798
Excuse me, ma'am.

1199
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,991
This is so stupid.

1200
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,071
- Okay.
- Here, 430.

1201
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:29,430
Lucille?

1202
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,113
I've got my key here somewhere.

1203
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,719
He had-had a funny turn.

1204
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,279
Oh, my goodness. What happened?

1205
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:35,919
Well, we were about to go onstage,

1206
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,479
and he said he wasn't feeling well,

1207
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,074
and he sort of collapsed.

1208
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,833
Collapsed? No, I need
to get a doctor right now.

1209
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,235
No doctor.

1210
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,118
I got him here as fast as I could.

1211
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,556
You should have taken him to the hospital.
Look at the state he's in.

1212
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:47,869
- I tried.
- Yes, hello.

1213
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,519
This is Mrs. Hardy in room 430.

1214
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,512
Now, I need a doctor to attend

1215
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,273
to my husband right away, please.

1216
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,317
- Mr. Oliver Hardy.
- Don't worry, I'm fine.

1217
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:56,595
My goodness, please hurry up.

1218
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:57,995
I'm so sorry, Lucille.

1219
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,992
Thank you, Stan. I'll take it from here.

1220
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,992
It's fine. Don't worry. You hang up.

1221
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,673
Goodness, why are they taking so long?

1222
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:06,150
- Hang up.
- Oh, my goodness, please hurry up.

1223
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:09,438
Yes, I already told you...

1224
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,471
Lucille won't let anybody near him.

1225
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,754
We can't expect him back anytime soon?

1226
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,873
- I-I don't think so.
- Oh, shame.

1227
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,031
The advance London bookings
are very strong.

1228
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,713
Everyone wants to see you.

1229
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,996
<i>Shows a huge success.</i>

1230
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,790
It's not Babe's fault that he got sick.

1231
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,713
No, of course not. Of course not.

1232
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,959
Stanley, am I right in thinking

1233
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,952
that before you teamed up with Oliver,

1234
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:51,679
you used to work with other partners?

1235
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:55,590
Well, yes, when I was in vaudeville,

1236
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,592
I-I worked with lots of different partners.

1237
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,639
Um... of course, Charlie Chaplin was one.

1238
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,279
- Mm.
- But th-these were very fleeting...

1239
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,272
And, of course,
Oliver made his elephant film

1240
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,510
with a different partner.

1241
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:09,472
Well, what's that got to do with anything?

1242
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,199
Oh, I don't know.

1243
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,351
Random thought. Heh.

1244
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,439
There's a, um... there's a very popular

1245
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,273
double act here called Cook and Baker.

1246
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,238
Cook is basically Hardy to Baker's Laurel,

1247
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,799
if you see what I mean.

1248
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:24,839
And I was just wondering
whether you might consider

1249
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,513
doing a couple of shows
with Nobby Cook,

1250
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:30,712
just to keep the seats full
until Oliver can return.

1251
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,871
Go on without Babe?

1252
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,835
Well, something to mull over, anyway.

1253
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:43,231
After all, those sausages don't pay
for themselves.

1254
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,473
Hi, Stan.

1255
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,159
Please don't tire him out.

1256
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,555
Hello, Ollie.

1257
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:30,079
I didn't expect to see you here today.

1258
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,477
I got you something.

1259
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,471
Eggs?

1260
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:46,638
- Laid 'em myself.
- Heh, heh.

1261
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,350
I had to go down to the kitchen
to see if they had any spare.

1262
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,710
Three shillings each, they cost me.

1263
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,712
Thank you, Stan.

1264
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,316
I'll have one now, if I may.

1265
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:01,914
Sure.

1266
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,320
You know, Lucille didn't have to go.

1267
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:08,515
She could have stayed.

1268
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,318
I mean, that-that argument we had

1269
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,596
the other night,
that was just... it was so silly.

1270
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,637
It was... it was a-about nothing.

1271
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,632
Just"

1272
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,632
just nothing.

1273
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,950
Babe, I-l wanted to talk to you...

1274
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,713
I'm retiring.

1275
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,278
What?

1276
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:30,520
The doctors told me
I can't continue with the tour,

1277
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:33,991
and I have promised Lucille I won't.

1278
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:39,034
So I'm retiring, Stan.

1279
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:42,431
I've promised Lucille, and that's that.

1280
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:44,750
I'm sorry.

1281
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,749
I should never have had us take this tour.

1282
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,719
<i>Well, je ne regrette rien.</i>

1283
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:54,110
And you shouldn't <i>regrette</i> rien, either.

1284
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:58,109
Can't you just rest until you're better,

1285
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,954
and then, you know,
we could start again?

1286
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,236
They say my heart won't take it.

1287
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:06,035
So I'm going home

1288
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,991
just as soon as we can arrange
the crossing.

1289
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,191
You're retiring.

1290
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:26,559
- Oh.
- Yes.

1291
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,599
Retiring.

1292
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,517
So, what have you been working on?

1293
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:43,671
- What?
- What new scenes for the movie

1294
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,917
- have you been working on?
- Oh.

1295
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,199
Nothing, really.

1296
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,431
I haven't seen you for two days,

1297
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,631
and you're trying to tell me
you haven't been working

1298
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,791
- on new material in that time?
- Ha, ha.

1299
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,520
Well...

1300
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,478
Come on, then, out with it.

1301
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:02,075
Well, I did have this idea
for a... a romantic scene

1302
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:03,958
where you're pining for Maid Marian,

1303
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:06,953
but she's holed up in a castle
with the Sheriff of Nottingham.

1304
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,110
Right.

1305
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,630
And then we hear
this very sad violin music,

1306
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,871
and you start to cry;
you can't handle it.

1307
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,118
And, uh, of course, you're...
you're bawling your eyes out,

1308
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:17,509
the tears are bouncing off your cheeks,

1309
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,193
but I'm not upset at all, you know,

1310
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:20,759
and I-l don't know what to do.

1311
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,598
- I'm...
- Ha, ha, ha.

1312
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:25,559
And, uh... and-and then suddenly,

1313
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,398
I-I think, "Oh, I know.

1314
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:28,914
"I'll-I'll get this potted plant,

1315
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:30,673
and I'll put it underneath you."

1316
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,353
- Ha, ha.
- You know, so at least...

1317
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,591
at least there'll be something
to catch the tears

1318
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,398
and give the plant... plant a watering.

1319
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,831
But then the plant just starts
growing like crazy, you know.

1320
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,750
I'll get the prop boys
to rig me up the tears

1321
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,240
so they're like little waterfalls.

1322
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:46,999
- That's right.
- That'll be a riot.

1323
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:49,515
That'll... that's great, Stan.
That'll go big.

1324
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,270
Would you do me a favor?

1325
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:01,999
Will you pull this blanket up on me?

1326
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:04,231
- Sure.
- I just can't seem to get warm.

1327
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,797
My goodness, your hands are like ice.

1328
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,110
- Yeah.
- Here.

1329
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,234
That better?

1330
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,073
Yes.

1331
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,914
So, have you talked to Delfont?

1332
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,391
I spoke to him this morning.

1333
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,312
What did he say?

1334
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:35,313
Well, he... he didn't know
you were retiring, of course,

1335
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:38,711
but he asked me, since you were sick,

1336
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,793
if I wouldn't mind carrying on
the show with somebody else.

1337
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,437
<i>Who'?</i>

1338
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,672
An English comedian called Nobby Cook.

1339
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:53,390
Well, that makes sense.

1340
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,590
It's for the best, Stan.

1341
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,192
Maybe it is.

1342
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,878
Well, that's settled, then.

1343
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:13,671
I'm retiring, and you're going on
with a new partner.

1344
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,759
Hmm.

1345
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:17,558
Yes.

1346
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,558
That's it.

1347
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:34,074
The other night, uh,
those things you said...

1348
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,195
did you mean them?

1349
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,038
No-.

1350
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:43,875
<i>DR! you'?</i>

1351
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,713
No.

1352
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,992
Good.

1353
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,917
Stanley, may I introduce to you
Mr. Nobby Cook,

1354
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,157
one of our finest music hall comedians.

1355
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,038
Very pleased to meet you, Nobby.

1356
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,032
I've heard a lot of great things about you.

1357
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,555
Mr. Laurel, I'm a big fan of yours.

1358
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,870
- I've seen all your films.
- Oh, we'll have none of that.

1359
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,360
You're Nobby. I'm Stanley.

1360
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,113
I'm looking forward
to rolling my sleeves up

1361
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,510
- and getting to work with you.
- Oh, thank you very much.

1362
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,472
It's very nice of you to say so.

1363
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:20,956
Heh, heh. You two are gonna be
absolutely terrific together.

1364
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,952
Wonderful rapport. I'm laughing already.

1365
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,519
Dare we attempt a run-through?

1366
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:26,512
If you like. I-l mean, it's up to Stan.

1367
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:27,875
Well, I can go off, come on again

1368
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,156
- and take it from the top.
- That'll be great.

1369
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:32,317
Good idea.

1370
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,952
Belting, this, Stan, eh'?

1371
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,236
Ha-ha-ha. Guaranteed laughs.

1372
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,437
What have you got there?

1373
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,439
Hard-boiled eggs and nuts?

1374
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,831
Hard-boiled eggs and nuts?
Don't be so daft.

1375
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,320
- What's the matter with you?
- Ha, ha.

1376
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:57,834
I can't eat that.

1377
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,958
Okay, and cue Stanley.

1378
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,716
Isn't this so much nicer, Babe?

1379
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,110
All the worry gone.

1380
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,634
Just you and I relaxing together.

1381
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,474
I spoke to Mother today,
and she passes on her love.

1382
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,074
<i>And what, pray you,</i>

1383
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:18,635
<i>has Robin Hood done
to inspire such wrath?</i>

1384
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,757
<i>Well, we've heard that he steals</i>

1385
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,480
<i>from the poor to give to the rich.</i>

1386
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:26,314
- lsn't that right, Stan?
- It certainly is.

1387
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,198
He's got the whole thing
the wrong way round.

1388
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:29,634
Exactly.

1389
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:33,031
Our idea, you see, is to give to the poor

1390
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,873
by stealing from the poor,

1391
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,111
<i>thereby cutting out the middleman.</i>

1392
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,590
<i>And the rich need never be any the wiser.</i>

1393
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,677
<i>- Precisely.
- Hmm.</i>

1394
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:45,233
- Oh!
- Ha-ha-ha!

1395
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,591
Here's another nice mess
you've gotten me into.

1396
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:15,555
Mm!

1397
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,671
How's that for you, Mr. Cook?

1398
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,917
Ladies and gentlemen,

1399
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,753
please take your seats,
as tonight's performance

1400
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,957
with Mr. Stan Laurel and Mr. Nobby Cook

1401
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,554
is about to commence.

1402
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:13,994
Laurel and Cook.

1403
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:16,151
Enormously exciting.

1404
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,789
Ladies and gentlemen,

1405
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,230
I'm afraid that, due to circumstances

1406
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,233
beyond our control,
tonight's performance

1407
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,311
has been canceled.

1408
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:24,990
Canceled?

1409
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:27,959
What's going on?

1410
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:34,358
Tickets can be
redeemed at the box office.

1411
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,517
Redeemed?

1412
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,633
You know, when you watch our movies,

1413
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:02,792
nobody else in the stories knows us,

1414
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:06,040
and we don't know anybody, either.

1415
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,750
It was just the two of us.

1416
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,230
All we had was each other.

1417
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,160
It was just the way we wanted it.

1418
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,836
I love him, Ida.

1419
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,837
We go home?

1420
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,193
Don't tell Babe.

1421
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:41,240
Tell him I'm going to continue
with the dates in Ireland.

1422
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:44,233
It would upset him to think
about me canceling the tour.

1423
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,712
The doctor thinks
you should be well enough

1424
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:58,269
to travel tomorrow, which is wonderful.

1425
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,278
Now, I'm gonna go down
and see if there's any mail,

1426
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,118
and then the Laurels will be stopping by

1427
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:05,033
to say goodbye
before they go to Ireland.

1428
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,032
I do hope it's not gonna rain today.

1429
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,679
When that wind gets up,

1430
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:11,912
the chill cuts right through to the bone.

1431
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,154
I won't be long, Babe.

1432
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,914
- Hurry back.
- Yeah. Mm.

1433
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:32,677
<i>Mr. Hardy, I believe you suffered</i>

1434
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:35,070
- a mild heart attack today.
- Oh.

1435
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:39,950
I also believe there is some evidence
of congestive failure.

1436
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,157
LUCILLE
Oh, dear God, I knew it.

1437
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,834
<i>Well, I think it's amazing</i>

1438
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,752
that you two are still going strong.

1439
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,877
I think it's wonderful you're still going.

1440
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,633
All me family love your films.

1441
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,632
<i>I</i> suggest you go home

1442
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:56,030
<i>as soon as you possibly can
to seek specialist treatment.</i>

1443
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:58,390
<i>You just wait till I tell me mam it's you.</i>

1444
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,710
<i>My wife loves your films.</i>

1445
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:04,236
You cannot possibly go onstage again

1446
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,835
in your current condition.

1447
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:16,677
One of the bellboys down there...

1448
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:19,116
Raymond, I think his name was...
said to tell you

1449
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,794
he had a good tip for you on a horse.

1450
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:25,510
Have you been gambling, Oliver Hardy?

1451
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,358
Oliver.

1452
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,798
Darling, you have money for bellboy?

1453
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:40,950
Sure.

1454
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,074
Answer, please. I powder nose.

1455
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:49,397
And give him five shillings only, no more.

1456
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,160
I'm only supposed to give you
a couple of...

1457
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,798
You're not leaving, are you, Stan?

1458
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:07,080
We've got some shows to do.

1459
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:28,953
I think we should all get below now,
out of this cold.

1460
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,474
Darling, I agree.

1461
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:33,314
Oliver, will you at least listen to me
about this?

1462
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:36,154
Or are you determined
to catch pneumonia?

1463
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,038
I'm enjoying the fresh air, honey.

1464
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:39,395
Really?

1465
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,035
Stan, why don't you come sit here?

1466
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,639
You girls go ahead if you're cold.

1467
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,438
All right.

1468
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,478
Come on, Ida.

1469
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,711
<i>- I'll</i> bring him down.
- Yeah.

1470
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,518
Come, we go.

1471
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:58,629
Thought you might want this back.

1472
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,950
Heh. Thanks.

1473
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:13,551
I lied to you, Babe.

1474
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,477
What do you mean?

1475
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:21,036
There is no movie.

1476
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,391
Miffin told me two weeks ago
it had fallen through.

1477
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,276
I guess people just don't want to see

1478
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:32,279
Laurel and Hardy pictures anymore.

1479
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,199
But...

1480
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,911
if I'd told you straightaway, then...

1481
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,878
maybe we could have finished
the tour early

1482
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:41,873
and you wouldn't have gotten sick.

1483
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:50,239
You knew two weeks ago
there was no movie?

1484
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,836
Yes, and I've been feeling terrible
about it.

1485
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:57,392
Stan...

1486
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,314
I knew.

1487
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,956
- You knew?
- I knew.

1488
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,560
Well, why didn't you tell me you knew?

1489
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:10,678
I thought you already knew I knew.

1490
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,990
How could I know that you knew I knew?

1491
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,790
What would my line be here?

1492
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:20,952
Um, well, "Now I know you knew,
but I thought you knew I knew,

1493
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,952
but you were pretending
not to know I knew."

1494
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:25,356
Ha-ha-ha. Thank you.

1495
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,674
Wait, if we both knew,

1496
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,956
why did we keep rehearsing the movie?

1497
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:35,995
What else are we gonna do?

1498
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,434
Thank you.

1499
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,352
Thank you very much.

1500
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,114
Thank you. Thank you.

1501
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,996
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Hello. Hello.

1502
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:45,474
- Thank you. I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.

1503
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,755
- I'm sorry. Good evening.
- Hello.

1504
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:47,830
- Good evening.
- My goodness.

1505
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,149
Thank you very much. Hello.

1506
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:50,754
- Yes. Thank you so much.
- Right.

1507
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:52,240
- Good evening.
- No, no, no.

1508
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:53,754
- No. No, no, no.
- What? Oh.

1509
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:56,315
- No.
- That's fine. That's fine.

1510
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,118
Good evening.

1511
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:02,317
Oh, my goodness, I'm a little nervous.

1512
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,073
- Heh.
- Don%be.

1513
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:06,356
- They'll be sensational.
- Heh.

1514
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:08,272
- Can I get you anything?
- Oh, no touching.

1515
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:45,119
Hard-boiled eggs and nuts.

1516
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:46,315
Mmm!

1517
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:43,239
You look tired, Babe.

1518
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:44,629
You look real tired.

1519
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,313
Why don't we just go out there

1520
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,153
and, uh, skip the song, say good night

1521
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:49,469
and we can finish there?

1522
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:53,072
I'm fine.

1523
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:11,472
It was fun while it lasted,
wasn't it, Stan?

1524
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:27,276
I'll miss us when we're gone.

1525
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:31,758
So will you.

1526
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:45,191
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

1527
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,630
We hope you've enjoyed
our bit of fun tonight.

1528
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,791
We've certainly enjoyed ourselves,
haven't we, Stanley?

1529
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:51,553
We certainly have.

1530
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,152
Well, we'd like to finish now
with a little dance.

1531
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,590
Oh, no.

1532
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,714
Maestro, if you would be so kind.

1533
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:05,314
Stanley.

1534
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:10,958
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure. I can do it.
