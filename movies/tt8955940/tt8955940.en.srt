3
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,264
I'm warning
you, stay back.

4
00:02:02,297 --> 00:02:04,166
Stay back, I'll
kill you, stay back!

5
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:06,201
Shoot him,
Frank, shoot him!

6
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:08,538
Is he dead?

7
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:10,239
You got
him, you got him.

8
00:02:10,272 --> 00:02:11,774
Good lord.

9
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:13,910
- That's not possible.
- He's getting up!

10
00:02:13,943 --> 00:02:14,777
No.

11
00:02:14,811 --> 00:02:16,211
Run, Martha, run!

12
00:02:46,743 --> 00:02:48,745
Remember,
deliver for any extraneous ducks,

13
00:02:48,778 --> 00:02:50,045
but don't kill the goose.

14
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,681
10-four.

15
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,522
Copy that.

16
00:03:31,688 --> 00:03:32,789
Help! Help!

17
00:03:34,724 --> 00:03:37,660
Initial numbers are
extremely promising.

18
00:03:37,694 --> 00:03:41,698
Reflexes, strength, you
name it, all enhanced.

19
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,299
Blood tests.

20
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,437
First scan shows a rare,
if not unique anemia.

21
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,072
I ordered more testing.

22
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,373
We should get the full
results in a few days.

23
00:03:51,407 --> 00:03:53,610
Good.

24
00:03:53,643 --> 00:03:56,779
Perhaps we could review
the results together.

25
00:03:59,181 --> 00:04:00,783
Together.

26
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:03,720
Well, it would
certainly expedite things,

27
00:04:03,753 --> 00:04:04,988
getting your involvement.

28
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:07,356
That's
not protocol.

29
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,190
I know.

30
00:04:10,093 --> 00:04:11,360
My apologies.

31
00:04:13,161 --> 00:04:15,064
But up
for consideration.

32
00:04:19,535 --> 00:04:20,369
Yes, sir.

33
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,071
Don't get too comfy.

34
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:16,191
What do I call you?

35
00:05:19,662 --> 00:05:20,563
Do you have a name?

36
00:05:20,596 --> 00:05:22,865
You can call me John.

37
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:23,833
Dr. Jansen.

38
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:24,701
I know.

39
00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:31,306
What's your origin.

40
00:05:33,776 --> 00:05:34,944
Where do you come from?

41
00:05:35,812 --> 00:05:37,747
Let's say I tell you.

42
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,449
Would you even know where it is?

43
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:41,651
Of course, I
have the internet.

44
00:05:41,684 --> 00:05:43,486
Then you've heard of Planet X.

45
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,287
Right next to
Planet Y, correct?

46
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:49,425
I like you.

47
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:50,292
You're funny.

48
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:52,227
Like your sister.

49
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:57,867
How do you know my sister?

50
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,102
We know all about you.

51
00:06:00,203 --> 00:06:01,236
We know everything.

52
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:02,105
Where is she?

53
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:05,273
Where is she?

54
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:12,682
You are absolutely out
of your league, Dr. Jansen.

55
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,118
We are coming for you.

56
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:17,186
All of you.

57
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:35,270
Alastair.

58
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:38,708
Dr. Jansen.

59
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:41,911
So nice to finally
meet you in person.

60
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:43,679
I thought I'd never see the day.

61
00:06:45,313 --> 00:06:46,649
Great work finding Jim.

62
00:06:47,683 --> 00:06:48,985
Can I see the test results?

63
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:50,086
Yes, of course.

64
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:50,953
Right this way.

65
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:57,760
Hi Jim.

66
00:06:57,794 --> 00:06:58,861
Hi Dr. Wang.

67
00:06:58,895 --> 00:07:00,463
How are you feeling today?

68
00:07:00,496 --> 00:07:01,631
Fine.

69
00:07:01,664 --> 00:07:03,533
And your migraines?

70
00:07:03,566 --> 00:07:05,201
Getting worse.

71
00:07:05,234 --> 00:07:07,136
Well, I think it was
smart of your doctor

72
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,704
in Chicago to refer you here.

73
00:07:08,738 --> 00:07:10,206
Can you stay any longer?

74
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:11,440
In Los Angeles?

75
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:13,976
Jim, we need to
run a few more tests.

76
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,845
Your anemia is very unusual.

77
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:17,814
Your red blood cells
containing hemoglobin,

78
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:20,216
which they use to transport
oxygen throughout your body.

79
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:22,718
Unfortunately, because
of the irregular shape,

80
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:24,387
not enough of them are
getting to your brain.

81
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,489
Is that what's causing
my sudden headaches?

82
00:07:26,522 --> 00:07:27,723
As I was saying, we're
gonna have to conduct

83
00:07:27,757 --> 00:07:29,959
a few more tests,
but in the meantime,

84
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:32,728
I can prescribe some
medication for your pain.

85
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:34,630
Thanks for getting somewhere.

86
00:07:34,664 --> 00:07:37,466
All right, just don't take
too many pills at one time.

87
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,901
Does it look like I would?

88
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:43,239
And there's one other
thing that we discovered.

89
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:44,540
My health can't
get anyworse, can it?

90
00:07:44,574 --> 00:07:46,642
We wanted to be
absolutely certain

91
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:48,878
that we understood what
was causing your symptoms,

92
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:51,080
So we tested, well-

93
00:07:51,113 --> 00:07:52,347
- Just say it, doc.

94
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:56,351
We discovered during our
analyses that you're sterile.

95
00:07:56,385 --> 00:07:59,155
Now, look, this isn't gonna
affect your health at all,

96
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:01,958
but it's something I thought
you'd want to be aware of.

97
00:08:05,394 --> 00:08:07,063
Is there something
you can do about that?

98
00:08:07,096 --> 00:08:09,665
Well, I am one of the top
hematologists in the country,

99
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:12,602
so maybe with further
tests, we could find

100
00:08:12,635 --> 00:08:14,303
the root cause of
your condition.

101
00:08:19,742 --> 00:08:21,644
Hold on a second, I
have to take this.

102
00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:27,884
Hey Doc?

103
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,464
Doc?

104
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:50,973
Dr. Wang?

105
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:51,874
Hello?

106
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:54,378
Is anyone there?

107
00:09:00,783 --> 00:09:01,584
Doc?

108
00:09:28,344 --> 00:09:29,178
Hello?

109
00:09:45,261 --> 00:09:46,696
Wait, did you have
an episode again?

110
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:48,297
You want us to come visit you?

111
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,707
John.

112
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,908
You're gonna shoot it.

113
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:01,944
Dark Ridge sand.

114
00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:33,943
Jim?

115
00:10:36,912 --> 00:10:38,214
Dr. Jansen.

116
00:10:38,247 --> 00:10:39,081
Jim.

117
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:41,050
How are you feeling?

118
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:44,720
Physically, pretty good.

119
00:10:44,754 --> 00:10:45,788
Good.

120
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:46,756
Sit down.

121
00:10:46,789 --> 00:10:47,990
You've been out for three days.

122
00:10:48,924 --> 00:10:50,460
That long.

123
00:10:50,494 --> 00:10:51,594
I tried to wake you up.

124
00:10:51,627 --> 00:10:52,928
What is that blue-

125
00:10:52,962 --> 00:10:54,163
- Energy.

126
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:55,865
For lack of a better word.

127
00:10:55,898 --> 00:10:57,501
There are a lot of
things here at the base

128
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:01,070
that will defy the logic
the rest of the world knows.

129
00:11:01,103 --> 00:11:03,706
For now you can think of
it as an organic energy

130
00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:05,808
we use to power this facility.

131
00:11:05,841 --> 00:11:08,611
Doors, among other things.

132
00:11:08,644 --> 00:11:10,079
Angela?

133
00:11:10,112 --> 00:11:12,048
- Can I see her?
- Sure.

134
00:11:12,081 --> 00:11:13,816
She's been assisting
me in the lab.

135
00:11:13,849 --> 00:11:14,683
She okay?

136
00:11:15,618 --> 00:11:16,453
Yeah.

137
00:11:17,653 --> 00:11:19,722
Yeah, I think she can
use some slowing down

138
00:11:20,956 --> 00:11:22,558
with the loss of your friends.

139
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,361
She's uhm...

140
00:11:25,395 --> 00:11:26,796
She's obsessed.

141
00:11:27,963 --> 00:11:29,932
What can I do to help?

142
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:31,501
Well, you're the
only human up until now

143
00:11:31,535 --> 00:11:32,902
who's been able to resist-

144
00:11:32,935 --> 00:11:33,736
- The red dust?

145
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:34,904
We call it Ash.

146
00:11:36,372 --> 00:11:38,841
Can I ask you, what
were your parents like?

147
00:11:38,874 --> 00:11:40,510
- Biological ones?
- Mm-hmm.

148
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:42,778
I was adopted at an
orphanage in Hong Kong.

149
00:11:42,812 --> 00:11:44,680
Brought me to Chicago
when I was eight.

150
00:11:44,713 --> 00:11:46,182
Recently I went back.

151
00:11:46,215 --> 00:11:48,084
Wouldn't give me the records.

152
00:11:48,117 --> 00:11:49,318
Okay, well, if you don't mind,

153
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:51,587
we'll do some research
on your background.

154
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,423
In the meantime, we
took some blood samples

155
00:11:53,457 --> 00:11:54,890
while you were asleep.

156
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:55,858
You did?

157
00:11:55,891 --> 00:11:57,593
Sorry, no time to waste.

158
00:11:57,626 --> 00:11:59,195
Angela will come and
see you after your

159
00:11:59,228 --> 00:12:01,097
introductory combat
training course.

160
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,399
Combat training?

161
00:12:02,432 --> 00:12:03,732
Well, you asked how
you could help, right?

162
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:05,034
Yeah, but I'm no
in the field type.

163
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:06,702
I applied to be an analyst.

164
00:12:06,735 --> 00:12:08,472
Perhaps before exposure.

165
00:12:08,505 --> 00:12:10,639
You took out several
highly trained soldiers

166
00:12:10,673 --> 00:12:12,875
who were under the
effects of Ash.

167
00:12:12,908 --> 00:12:14,310
I'd say you're qualified.

168
00:12:16,212 --> 00:12:18,280
Couldn't save my
friends, so who cares?

169
00:12:21,183 --> 00:12:22,017
Look.

170
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,490
I lost my sister to this too.

171
00:12:26,523 --> 00:12:29,792
Many in this facility have
have lost friends and family.

172
00:12:32,061 --> 00:12:35,297
But you're the first
breakthrough we've had in years.

173
00:12:35,331 --> 00:12:37,434
So you'll learn how
to become one of us

174
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:39,935
while we test and examine
your capabilities.

175
00:12:41,904 --> 00:12:42,705
Now suit up.

176
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:02,324
Hi, you must be Jim.

177
00:13:02,358 --> 00:13:03,659
- Aaron.
- Nice to meet you.

178
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:05,261
I can't wait for you
to run the gauntlet

179
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:07,830
with your abilities.

180
00:13:07,863 --> 00:13:09,499
It's designed to test and train

181
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:11,000
the best soldiers in the world.

182
00:13:12,402 --> 00:13:15,237
Let's get you set up with
some of our new tactical gear.

183
00:13:15,271 --> 00:13:17,940
These are training phasers.

184
00:13:17,973 --> 00:13:19,476
Phasers are just
like regular firearms

185
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:23,345
except they fire a
spherical, energized round.

186
00:13:27,617 --> 00:13:29,685
You're human, you get a
nice little electrical jolt

187
00:13:29,718 --> 00:13:31,187
to signify your hit.

188
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,023
If you're a RUNT,
you get shut down.

189
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:35,458
RUNTs?

190
00:13:35,492 --> 00:13:38,127
Robotic Unit
Enforcement Trainers?

191
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:40,796
Dr. Jansen didn't tell you?

192
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:42,031
No.

193
00:13:42,064 --> 00:13:42,831
Nice to know. I'm
not the only one here

194
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:43,899
on a need to know basis.

195
00:13:48,103 --> 00:13:49,539
What's this?

196
00:13:49,573 --> 00:13:50,773
And I hope you don't
mind if I took the liberty

197
00:13:50,806 --> 00:13:53,410
of upgrading your
armor a little bit.

198
00:13:53,443 --> 00:13:55,144
I was a double-E at Cornell.

199
00:13:55,177 --> 00:13:56,145
Electrical engineer.

200
00:13:56,178 --> 00:13:58,247
So how did you get here?

201
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,782
Well, I graduated
when I was 16,

202
00:13:59,815 --> 00:14:02,652
and some weapons I designed
ended up in the wrong hands.

203
00:14:02,686 --> 00:14:04,621
So to keep myself
out of trouble.

204
00:14:04,654 --> 00:14:05,721
And the robots.

205
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:08,924
You'll find out soon enough.

206
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,460
Let's go.

207
00:14:10,493 --> 00:14:11,260
Right.

208
00:14:11,293 --> 00:14:13,229
So I got you this.

209
00:14:13,262 --> 00:14:15,565
I've outfitted it with a
camera and a communicator.

210
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:17,299
So, yeah.

211
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,167
Thanks.

212
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,034
Good luck.

213
00:14:25,975 --> 00:14:28,811
Okay, Jim, we'll
start you off slow.

214
00:14:31,615 --> 00:14:32,815
What's my objective?

215
00:14:32,848 --> 00:14:35,552
Eliminate as
many RUNTs as possible.

216
00:14:35,585 --> 00:14:36,986
Seems simple enough.

217
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:38,354
Starting off on level three.

218
00:14:38,388 --> 00:14:39,788
Ma'am, you said slow.

219
00:14:39,822 --> 00:14:41,023
It's a relative term.

220
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:43,493
Five.

221
00:14:43,526 --> 00:14:44,326
Four.

222
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,228
Dispensing R.U.N.T.s.

223
00:14:47,162 --> 00:14:48,431
Two.

224
00:14:48,465 --> 00:14:49,298
- Now.
- One.

225
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:52,801
Active.

226
00:15:22,532 --> 00:15:23,733
How's he doing?

227
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:25,834
He is turning level
three into Swiss cheese.

228
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,606
He's already on level three?

229
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:30,774
Go to level four.

230
00:15:34,176 --> 00:15:34,977
Billy!

231
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,278
Oh, yep, okay.

232
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:37,514
Yeah.

233
00:15:37,547 --> 00:15:38,448
Level four.

234
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:41,418
Three, two, one.

235
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:42,351
Right now.

236
00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:43,319
Level four.

237
00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:49,793
Gettin' fancy, Jim.

238
00:15:54,229 --> 00:15:55,164
He's so fast.

239
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:03,272
Level five.

240
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:05,608
Ma'am.

241
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:12,615
I can't watch this.

242
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:14,316
Level five?

243
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,218
Level
five verified.

244
00:16:18,087 --> 00:16:19,355
All right, I gotta watch this.

245
00:16:36,071 --> 00:16:38,441
What the hell?

246
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:46,949
Not bad.

247
00:16:47,983 --> 00:16:49,218
Run him through it again.

248
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:50,587
No...

249
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,454
Ma'am?

250
00:16:54,591 --> 00:16:55,392
Seriously?

251
00:16:57,627 --> 00:16:59,562
We are not his parents, Lucy.

252
00:17:00,797 --> 00:17:02,131
He's never gonna accept it.

253
00:17:06,636 --> 00:17:08,738
What did you expect?

254
00:17:08,772 --> 00:17:10,939
He was eight years old
when we adopted him.

255
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:13,208
I wanted a baby!

256
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:19,915
Hi Jim.

257
00:17:19,948 --> 00:17:20,784
I'm Charles.

258
00:17:22,852 --> 00:17:24,253
We're your new parents.

259
00:17:24,286 --> 00:17:26,288
And we're gonna take
you to a new place.

260
00:17:38,668 --> 00:17:39,502
I know.

261
00:17:44,674 --> 00:17:47,276
I never thought he would
get into this much trouble.

262
00:17:48,578 --> 00:17:49,913
I didn't think so either.

263
00:17:52,816 --> 00:17:53,850
You tried, Charles.

264
00:17:57,787 --> 00:17:59,321
That's it.

265
00:17:59,354 --> 00:18:00,857
When he turns 18, we're done.

266
00:18:23,413 --> 00:18:25,548
Jim, how do you resist?

267
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:27,784
Look how pathetic
humans are without us.

268
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:30,219
Everything feels
better when I listen.

269
00:18:30,252 --> 00:18:31,053
There's a cure, okay?

270
00:18:31,086 --> 00:18:32,221
Listen to me!

271
00:18:32,254 --> 00:18:34,990
- Kill me, please!
- I can't...

272
00:18:38,428 --> 00:18:39,361
No, please.

273
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:50,372
Hey.

274
00:18:51,441 --> 00:18:52,274
Hey.

275
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,444
Are you all right?

276
00:18:54,477 --> 00:18:55,310
Mm-hmm.

277
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:58,247
Wait, you can't be here.

278
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,348
Your residency.

279
00:18:59,382 --> 00:19:01,083
I took a leave of absence

280
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,153
That's your dream, Angela.

281
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:07,824
I can't face them right now.

282
00:19:13,963 --> 00:19:15,865
What do we tell them?

283
00:19:17,065 --> 00:19:19,301
Dr. Jansen said that
they're gonna help us

284
00:19:19,334 --> 00:19:21,370
devise an explanation
when we're ready.

285
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,277
Can't imagine
what that would be.

286
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:31,748
I'm hoping that
a little time here,

287
00:19:31,781 --> 00:19:34,617
and we'll figure it out.

288
00:19:37,085 --> 00:19:37,921
Together.

289
00:19:48,765 --> 00:19:49,566
Hey Jim.

290
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,802
Hey, don't worry
about level five.

291
00:19:52,835 --> 00:19:55,038
You know, it was your first
time, you'll figure it out.

292
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,305
How many levels are there?

293
00:19:56,338 --> 00:19:57,774
One through five
is single player.

294
00:19:57,807 --> 00:20:00,208
Six, seven, eight,
are multiplayer.

295
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:03,947
Is it true that you have
some of the Ash's powers?

296
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,080
This is Higgins.

297
00:20:05,113 --> 00:20:06,281
He lost his parents to the Ash.

298
00:20:06,315 --> 00:20:07,650
I'm afraid so.

299
00:20:07,684 --> 00:20:08,918
Is it contagious?

300
00:20:08,952 --> 00:20:10,987
He would've been quarantined.

301
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,155
I heard that they scanned
your body and the Ash

302
00:20:13,188 --> 00:20:14,757
is somehow inert inside of you?

303
00:20:15,892 --> 00:20:17,694
Just in case, I'll
try not to cough on you.

304
00:20:17,727 --> 00:20:21,664
Mr. Yung, you've been requested
in conference room nine.

305
00:20:21,698 --> 00:20:22,532
Thanks.

306
00:20:23,466 --> 00:20:24,834
You're gonna meet him.

307
00:20:26,234 --> 00:20:27,470
- Who?
- Alastair.

308
00:20:28,605 --> 00:20:29,906
At least that's
what they call him.

309
00:20:29,939 --> 00:20:33,042
I heard he's here, on base.

310
00:20:33,977 --> 00:20:34,811
So?

311
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:38,514
Who do you think's paying
for this whole operation?

312
00:20:38,548 --> 00:20:39,782
The government?

313
00:20:42,518 --> 00:20:44,687
No, this is a big deal, okay?

314
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:45,888
He's never been here.

315
00:20:45,922 --> 00:20:47,924
To conceal his
identity, of course.

316
00:20:49,224 --> 00:20:50,727
Go!

317
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,764
Alastair is the founder
of our agency, the ESU.

318
00:20:54,797 --> 00:20:56,933
Extraterrestrial
Special Forces Unit.

319
00:20:58,367 --> 00:21:01,638
Firstly, I'm sorry for what
happened to your friends.

320
00:21:03,406 --> 00:21:04,641
Thanks.

321
00:21:04,674 --> 00:21:07,142
I read your
application to the CIA.

322
00:21:07,175 --> 00:21:08,310
You did?

323
00:21:08,343 --> 00:21:10,178
It was a good essay.

324
00:21:10,212 --> 00:21:11,848
Didn't help me get accepted.

325
00:21:11,881 --> 00:21:15,317
Well, perhaps you weren't
meant to work at that agency.

326
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,819
Why did you start this one?

327
00:21:22,025 --> 00:21:25,461
About 25 years ago, I
created an internet company

328
00:21:25,495 --> 00:21:27,630
that does blockchain
financial trades

329
00:21:27,664 --> 00:21:29,197
using artificial intelligence.

330
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:31,934
It went I.P.O..

331
00:21:31,968 --> 00:21:34,437
Before I knew it, my
wealth was in the league

332
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,440
of a small number of
people on this planet.

333
00:21:37,473 --> 00:21:41,411
I started getting invited
to private elite parties.

334
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:44,981
Eventually, these
individuals asked me

335
00:21:45,014 --> 00:21:46,783
to join a secret group.

336
00:21:46,816 --> 00:21:49,419
But as I delved
further, joining them

337
00:21:49,452 --> 00:21:54,090
meant serving the Kinians,
a powerful alien race.

338
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:58,861
I thought it was a
legend, until I was asked

339
00:21:58,895 --> 00:21:59,796
to do something.

340
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:03,298
Something I will never
forgive myself for.

341
00:22:05,601 --> 00:22:08,571
After I left, I disappeared.

342
00:22:09,505 --> 00:22:11,107
It wasn't easy.

343
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,909
They started going
after all the people

344
00:22:12,942 --> 00:22:16,412
that were close to me,
so I started this agency

345
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,515
to protect people I care about,

346
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:23,351
and the human race, for
what is to eventually come

347
00:22:23,386 --> 00:22:24,554
if we don't stop them.

348
00:22:26,354 --> 00:22:27,590
What's coming?

349
00:22:29,025 --> 00:22:32,695
The Ash has great power,
and is used as a weapon

350
00:22:32,729 --> 00:22:35,565
by the aliens to
control human beings.

351
00:22:35,598 --> 00:22:37,299
For a while, they
stopped using the Ash.

352
00:22:37,332 --> 00:22:39,334
They found they didn't need it.

353
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:43,271
Greed was enough to
keep us under control.

354
00:22:43,305 --> 00:22:44,207
Until now.

355
00:22:46,308 --> 00:22:48,343
What's changed?

356
00:22:48,377 --> 00:22:49,879
We don't know, Jim.

357
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:54,117
We do know long ago, we were
used as slaves and servants.

358
00:22:55,485 --> 00:22:58,788
There seems to be something
greater they're after.

359
00:22:58,821 --> 00:23:00,790
You mentioned in your encounter

360
00:23:00,823 --> 00:23:04,026
you were able to communicate
with them telepathically.

361
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,961
Potentially.

362
00:23:06,562 --> 00:23:08,097
I'm not really sure.

363
00:23:08,131 --> 00:23:11,701
Then we need you to make
contact with one of them.

364
00:23:11,734 --> 00:23:14,570
Try to find out what
their purpose is now.

365
00:23:14,604 --> 00:23:17,140
There are risks you
should be aware of.

366
00:23:17,173 --> 00:23:21,644
I prefer a more
scientific approach.

367
00:23:21,677 --> 00:23:23,146
What are the risks?

368
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:27,183
I believe you'd be entering
some sort of dimension

369
00:23:27,216 --> 00:23:30,720
or mind realm where they
store their information.

370
00:23:30,753 --> 00:23:32,354
Given that your
mind is traveling,

371
00:23:32,388 --> 00:23:36,492
you may get lost and
never find your way back.

372
00:23:36,526 --> 00:23:37,359
Or worse.

373
00:23:38,761 --> 00:23:39,762
I won't force you.

374
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:41,831
So think about it.

375
00:23:46,702 --> 00:23:50,773
I believe you'd be entering
in some sort of dimension

376
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:52,208
or mind realm.

377
00:23:52,241 --> 00:23:53,576
Mr. Yung.

378
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:55,144
I need you to count
yourself lucky

379
00:23:55,178 --> 00:23:56,813
that I'm not about
to haul your ass down

380
00:23:56,846 --> 00:23:59,148
to the precinct right now.

381
00:23:59,182 --> 00:24:01,751
So I need you to
promise me something.

382
00:24:01,784 --> 00:24:03,386
I need you to promise
me that I'm never gonna

383
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:05,788
see you around here again.

384
00:24:05,822 --> 00:24:09,192
Next time, I'm not
gonna be so lenient.

385
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:10,560
Do you understand that?

386
00:24:12,962 --> 00:24:15,363
I said, do you understand that?

387
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:18,034
Yes.

388
00:24:18,067 --> 00:24:19,468
Yes what?

389
00:24:24,574 --> 00:24:25,575
Yes...

390
00:24:27,076 --> 00:24:27,910
Sir.

391
00:24:29,078 --> 00:24:30,213
Good.

392
00:24:30,246 --> 00:24:32,215
Now get outta here.

393
00:24:32,248 --> 00:24:33,749
I'm Captain Linden.

394
00:24:33,783 --> 00:24:36,018
We have readings of a strong
electromagnetic disturbance

395
00:24:36,052 --> 00:24:36,986
in the area.

396
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:38,588
Any idea where it's coming from?

397
00:24:38,621 --> 00:24:39,922
Just over that ridge.

398
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:41,224
I'll show you

399
00:24:41,257 --> 00:24:42,992
What's the deal, boys?

400
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:43,826
Get down.

401
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,061
Get down, now!

402
00:24:45,094 --> 00:24:48,464
Go, go, go, go!

403
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:52,134
We're part of a
covert task force.

404
00:24:52,168 --> 00:24:54,136
Group of grays
who have developed

405
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:55,905
biological control mechanisms.

406
00:24:57,173 --> 00:24:57,974
They're starting to move.

407
00:24:58,007 --> 00:24:59,208
I'll buy 'em off.

408
00:24:59,242 --> 00:25:01,677
Dr. Victoria Jansen,
trust no one else!

409
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,782
Hey Jim

410
00:25:09,819 --> 00:25:10,620
Jim.

411
00:25:12,088 --> 00:25:13,489
You okay?

412
00:25:13,522 --> 00:25:14,657
Yeah, I'm fine.

413
00:25:15,825 --> 00:25:16,726
The team's back.

414
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,828
Sorry, what?

415
00:25:18,861 --> 00:25:20,329
- Who?
- Our main faction.

416
00:25:21,264 --> 00:25:22,865
Yeah, we're number 53.

417
00:25:22,899 --> 00:25:24,333
Every base has a number.

418
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:25,234
Ours is 53.

419
00:25:25,268 --> 00:25:26,736
There's 52, 51.

420
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:28,971
You may have heard of, the
government likes to act

421
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:30,606
like it's one of theirs.

422
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,710
That's Smith, Rogers,
Bell, and Captain Linden.

423
00:25:36,445 --> 00:25:37,280
Captain Linden.

424
00:25:38,681 --> 00:25:43,686
He looks a lot like the
marine I met in the desert.

425
00:25:44,854 --> 00:25:46,022
We don't talk
about his brother.

426
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,524
Hey.

427
00:25:50,126 --> 00:25:52,396
Hey, this is Jim.

428
00:25:52,428 --> 00:25:53,496
Yeah, we know.

429
00:25:54,764 --> 00:25:56,232
We heard you
wrecked the gauntlet.

430
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:57,700
Practically demolished it.

431
00:25:58,935 --> 00:25:59,769
That's good.

432
00:26:00,703 --> 00:26:02,238
But RUNTs aren't marines.

433
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:04,774
Well...

434
00:26:04,807 --> 00:26:05,808
I don't know, Cap.

435
00:26:07,476 --> 00:26:08,378
He did pretty well.

436
00:26:08,412 --> 00:26:09,912
You should check his scorecard.

437
00:26:12,448 --> 00:26:13,282
I was lucky.

438
00:26:15,584 --> 00:26:17,421
Let's try your
luck in a scrimmage.

439
00:26:18,854 --> 00:26:20,022
Sorry?

440
00:26:20,056 --> 00:26:23,159
You, Aaron, Billy
versus us three.

441
00:26:23,192 --> 00:26:25,661
I'll give you Smith, he's
one of my best soldiers.

442
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:27,830
So it'll be four V three.

443
00:26:28,965 --> 00:26:30,599
I don't think
that's a good idea.

444
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:31,435
No way.

445
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:32,301
It'll be fun.

446
00:26:36,005 --> 00:26:37,039
You can keep Smith.

447
00:26:38,774 --> 00:26:39,709
I'll take Higgins.

448
00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:45,081
May the best team win.

449
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:48,084
Are you crazy?

450
00:26:48,117 --> 00:26:49,453
Why did you just do that?

451
00:26:51,287 --> 00:26:52,121
We'll see.

452
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:53,022
No, you...

453
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:55,257
"We'll see."

454
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:56,125
Okay.

455
00:26:58,961 --> 00:27:00,397
This is amazing.

456
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:06,669
- Turns red blood cells-
- Yeah.

457
00:27:06,702 --> 00:27:08,904
The irregularly shaped ones.

458
00:27:08,938 --> 00:27:10,639
The robot added some
Ash to his blood

459
00:27:10,673 --> 00:27:11,974
in the isolation chamber.

460
00:27:13,443 --> 00:27:15,177
Here are some normal
red blood cells

461
00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:19,383
with the Ash, and
Jim's red blood cells.

462
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:21,717
- Won't let the Ash latch on.
- Yeah.

463
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:23,352
Because of their shape and form.

464
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,788
And without a proper connection,

465
00:27:25,821 --> 00:27:28,458
the Ash can't circulate in
the blood like it wants to.

466
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:32,762
Where does he get all
of his strength from,

467
00:27:32,795 --> 00:27:35,097
the healing, the
stamina, like the others?

468
00:27:36,198 --> 00:27:39,802
It looks like some sort of
advanced human gene therapy.

469
00:27:39,835 --> 00:27:41,737
But what really
stands out is that

470
00:27:41,771 --> 00:27:44,707
Jim has a set of genes
that I can't seem

471
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,411
to match or identify with
anything we've seen before.

472
00:27:48,577 --> 00:27:50,212
Do you think that's
the key to the cure?

473
00:27:50,246 --> 00:27:52,648
To identify those
specific genes?

474
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:53,682
I hope so.

475
00:27:55,618 --> 00:27:58,220
You did genetic screening
in your residency, right?

476
00:27:58,254 --> 00:27:59,055
Yeah.

477
00:27:59,088 --> 00:28:00,656
How'd you know?

478
00:28:00,689 --> 00:28:03,659
We have access to all
the information here.

479
00:28:03,692 --> 00:28:06,396
Why don't you track down an
old blood sample of Jim's

480
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,197
and start comparing it
with a new blood sample?

481
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,065
Okay.

482
00:28:17,006 --> 00:28:19,141
Jim, we meet again.

483
00:28:24,847 --> 00:28:26,682
Really, how are you?

484
00:28:27,783 --> 00:28:28,984
Where's John?

485
00:28:29,018 --> 00:28:31,320
You want to come
inside and see?

486
00:28:31,353 --> 00:28:33,255
Try and talk to the other John?

487
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:34,323
He's doing just fine.

488
00:28:34,356 --> 00:28:35,858
Maybe even better than before.

489
00:28:43,732 --> 00:28:44,800
Where are we?

490
00:28:44,834 --> 00:28:45,734
I don't know.

491
00:28:45,768 --> 00:28:49,539
Another dimension, realm.

492
00:28:49,573 --> 00:28:51,575
Hey Jim, I may have
found something,

493
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:54,143
but there's something blocking
me from taking you further.

494
00:28:54,176 --> 00:28:55,378
What do I do?

495
00:28:55,412 --> 00:28:57,880
Find a way to
get better access.

496
00:29:05,688 --> 00:29:06,523
See?

497
00:29:08,991 --> 00:29:10,860
We are the ones in control.

498
00:29:18,535 --> 00:29:21,237
You are making
amazing progress.

499
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,705
But I still can't
interface with them.

500
00:29:22,738 --> 00:29:24,240
It's still on his terms.

501
00:29:25,174 --> 00:29:26,008
That'll come.

502
00:29:28,478 --> 00:29:29,546
So what do you think?

503
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,650
Does it make lattes?

504
00:29:43,726 --> 00:29:44,561
Where does it go?

505
00:29:45,629 --> 00:29:46,795
All over the world.

506
00:29:47,997 --> 00:29:49,765
How did you discover
these tunnels?

507
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:50,799
I didn't.

508
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:52,201
A villager in China discovered

509
00:29:52,234 --> 00:29:54,604
the Long Yo Caves
back in the '90s.

510
00:29:54,638 --> 00:29:59,141
Computer, tell Jim about
the Long Yo Grotto Caves.

511
00:29:59,175 --> 00:30:00,976
Experts
estimate it would have taken

512
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:04,013
1000 workers working day
and night for six years

513
00:30:04,046 --> 00:30:07,349
to remove 900,000 cubic
meters of solid rock.

514
00:30:08,618 --> 00:30:09,952
And we just reverse engineered

515
00:30:09,985 --> 00:30:11,454
this ship to travel through.

516
00:30:11,488 --> 00:30:14,424
We've only been operating
for the past few years.

517
00:30:14,457 --> 00:30:15,858
Who created these tunnels?

518
00:30:17,293 --> 00:30:21,230
Computer, how good are
you at making lattes?

519
00:30:21,263 --> 00:30:22,566
Unparalleled.

520
00:30:24,501 --> 00:30:27,236
The Kinians are an alien
race that settled on Earth

521
00:30:27,269 --> 00:30:29,205
500,000 years ago.

522
00:30:31,907 --> 00:30:33,375
They are back, Jim.

523
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:38,881
The meteor you stumbled upon,
its frequency is increasing.

524
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:43,453
Forget about movies where
gigantic ships land in our cities.

525
00:30:43,486 --> 00:30:46,889
This is a real war,
and they're using

526
00:30:46,922 --> 00:30:49,693
the same tactics we use
to take over a country

527
00:30:49,725 --> 00:30:53,929
and install a government
that serves our own economy

528
00:30:53,963 --> 00:30:55,331
from the inside.

529
00:30:57,233 --> 00:31:02,204
When I learned about the
aliens from Captain Linden,

530
00:31:02,838 --> 00:31:03,673
I wanted to run.

531
00:31:04,873 --> 00:31:05,975
You should have.

532
00:31:07,943 --> 00:31:11,448
You know, I never felt
so much ability, power.

533
00:31:12,281 --> 00:31:13,115
But...

534
00:31:17,554 --> 00:31:19,456
Most people
still would've run.

535
00:31:22,492 --> 00:31:25,094
When I saw what the
Ash was capable of,

536
00:31:26,529 --> 00:31:33,436
I knew they would find us,
and they would find Angela.

537
00:31:34,837 --> 00:31:39,808
In protecting the ones we
love, the world can be stronger.

538
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,384
All right, I'll set it
to team competition mode,

539
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:49,452
100 point score card.

540
00:31:49,486 --> 00:31:50,919
Each RUNT kill is worth a point.

541
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:53,989
A player kill is worth
10, juggernaut's worth 25.

542
00:31:54,023 --> 00:31:55,558
Juggernaut?

543
00:31:55,592 --> 00:31:57,059
Yeah, it's a...

544
00:31:57,092 --> 00:31:58,027
Nevermind.

545
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,361
Okay.

546
00:31:59,396 --> 00:32:00,896
- Put 'em in their place.
- Copy that.

547
00:32:05,468 --> 00:32:06,569
You guys stay center.

548
00:32:06,603 --> 00:32:08,170
Check.

549
00:32:08,203 --> 00:32:09,539
You got it.

550
00:32:09,572 --> 00:32:10,339
Can't wait.

551
00:32:10,372 --> 00:32:11,874
Five.

552
00:32:11,907 --> 00:32:13,309
Four.

553
00:32:13,342 --> 00:32:14,778
Three.

554
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:15,645
Two.

555
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:17,480
One.

556
00:32:55,752 --> 00:32:57,487
Clear, advance.

557
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,354
Go!

558
00:33:02,057 --> 00:33:02,991
Let's pick it up.

559
00:33:08,732 --> 00:33:10,132
Copy that.

560
00:33:16,305 --> 00:33:19,241
- How we doing?
- We're behind in kills.

561
00:33:19,274 --> 00:33:21,176
We need to take out
their team to catch up.

562
00:33:26,416 --> 00:33:27,784
Dammit!

563
00:33:27,817 --> 00:33:28,785
Sorry, team.

564
00:33:33,757 --> 00:33:34,557
Yes!

565
00:33:34,591 --> 00:33:35,425
You're out.

566
00:33:42,866 --> 00:33:44,933
Jim, we're down 15.

567
00:33:44,967 --> 00:33:47,437
Don't focus on the
juggernaut, he's worth 25,

568
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,672
but he'll be really hard
to take out by yourself.

569
00:33:49,706 --> 00:33:52,776
You're better off taking
down Linden and Bell.

570
00:34:00,048 --> 00:34:01,651
Jim, take Bell out!

571
00:34:09,258 --> 00:34:10,058
Ah, man.

572
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,932
Hey, big man.

573
00:34:16,965 --> 00:34:17,867
Over here!

574
00:34:36,653 --> 00:34:37,487
Nice job.

575
00:34:39,988 --> 00:34:40,790
Good game.

576
00:34:47,996 --> 00:34:48,798
Thanks.

577
00:35:03,278 --> 00:35:04,279
What have you got?

578
00:35:05,782 --> 00:35:08,918
Okay, there's there's
already some obvious findings.

579
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:13,756
It's like the Ash turned on
genes related to human function.

580
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,592
Activated them somehow.

581
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:17,560
Huh, what functions?

582
00:35:17,594 --> 00:35:19,496
Okay, so for example,
his DNA over here

583
00:35:19,529 --> 00:35:21,631
handles his adrenal
glands, and this one

584
00:35:21,664 --> 00:35:23,031
muscle fiber recruitment.

585
00:35:23,065 --> 00:35:24,366
- Strength.
- Yeah.

586
00:35:25,535 --> 00:35:27,002
His white blood cell
production, platelets,

587
00:35:27,035 --> 00:35:28,538
immune system over here.

588
00:35:28,571 --> 00:35:29,439
Healing.

589
00:35:30,707 --> 00:35:32,307
What about the liver?

590
00:35:32,341 --> 00:35:34,911
Is it his weakness,
like the others?

591
00:35:34,944 --> 00:35:36,412
I'm not sure.

592
00:35:36,446 --> 00:35:39,114
The liver's the one organ
that's extremely complicated

593
00:35:39,147 --> 00:35:42,084
in terms of its DNA because of
its regenerative properties.

594
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:45,488
My guess is yes.

595
00:35:46,823 --> 00:35:48,357
I'm hoping that I'm wrong.

596
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:51,961
Too bad we can't
test your theory, huh?

597
00:35:54,096 --> 00:35:55,765
Good job, Angela.

598
00:35:55,798 --> 00:35:56,633
I mean, Doctor.

599
00:35:57,534 --> 00:35:58,701
You're one also, right?

600
00:36:00,003 --> 00:36:02,972
Second year of
residency.

601
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,581
Good.

602
00:36:12,749 --> 00:36:15,018
For you and for
what you have...

603
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:18,153
Oh my god, can you
imagine the possibilities?

604
00:36:19,022 --> 00:36:20,023
What we could learn?

605
00:36:22,725 --> 00:36:23,960
We could heal people.

606
00:36:25,093 --> 00:36:27,897
We could maybe cure cancer.

607
00:36:27,931 --> 00:36:30,332
Why couldn't this happen
to somebody stronger?

608
00:36:30,365 --> 00:36:31,501
Smarter?

609
00:36:31,534 --> 00:36:33,536
What if this did
happen to someone else?

610
00:36:34,737 --> 00:36:37,774
Hey, I think there's
a reason it was you.

611
00:36:39,274 --> 00:36:40,410
I'm not even average.

612
00:36:44,881 --> 00:36:47,417
Do you remember when I
was studying for my NCATs?

613
00:36:49,117 --> 00:36:50,587
Of course I do.

614
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,220
It's because you spent
all that time quizzing me

615
00:36:52,254 --> 00:36:53,723
that I scored so well.

616
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:56,025
That's not average.

617
00:36:58,027 --> 00:36:59,062
Who you are...

618
00:37:00,797 --> 00:37:01,898
It's not average.

619
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:07,870
You're crazy.

620
00:37:07,904 --> 00:37:11,340
I know.

621
00:37:11,373 --> 00:37:12,207
Oh.

622
00:37:13,076 --> 00:37:14,711
You're capable of anything.

623
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,448
Except maybe cooking.

624
00:37:20,717 --> 00:37:22,150
Was something
that we already did

625
00:37:22,184 --> 00:37:24,554
- where I specified which team-
- You want to sit with us?

626
00:37:25,555 --> 00:37:26,389
Really?

627
00:37:29,459 --> 00:37:30,292
I'm fine here.

628
00:37:31,661 --> 00:37:32,462
Okay.

629
00:37:34,262 --> 00:37:35,898
You can join us
if that's okay.

630
00:37:38,768 --> 00:37:40,903
- I can.
- Have a seat.

631
00:37:44,373 --> 00:37:45,608
Really like the new M4s.

632
00:37:46,876 --> 00:37:48,210
Handle really nice.

633
00:37:48,243 --> 00:37:50,446
Light, powerful.

634
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,315
Thanks, I've made some
upgrades here and there.

635
00:37:55,985 --> 00:37:58,353
So you did really
well in training.

636
00:38:00,288 --> 00:38:03,526
Thanks, but you guys won.

637
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:04,794
Really?

638
00:38:04,827 --> 00:38:06,095
I mean, I'd say it
was more of a tie.

639
00:38:12,468 --> 00:38:16,973
Look, I read your case file.

640
00:38:17,006 --> 00:38:18,708
You reported when John
was first infected,

641
00:38:18,741 --> 00:38:20,410
you shot him in the chest.

642
00:38:20,443 --> 00:38:22,210
Ash leaked out,
touched your hand,

643
00:38:22,244 --> 00:38:25,014
and somehow his memory
and special forces skills

644
00:38:25,048 --> 00:38:26,849
are ingrained in you?

645
00:38:29,552 --> 00:38:30,653
Something like that.

646
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:35,190
It still doesn't
explain your courage.

647
00:38:36,993 --> 00:38:38,428
What are you talking about?

648
00:38:40,362 --> 00:38:43,833
Look, I've fought
with a lot of men,

649
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:47,603
and under pressure, they fold
when outnumbered or outgunned

650
00:38:47,637 --> 00:38:50,540
and you weren't even
playing the same game

651
00:38:50,573 --> 00:38:51,641
as everybody else.

652
00:38:53,241 --> 00:38:54,677
I just did what came to me.

653
00:39:01,918 --> 00:39:05,688
Maybe you're just not aware
of what you're capable of yet.

654
00:39:08,725 --> 00:39:09,559
Excuse me.

655
00:39:13,062 --> 00:39:14,430
Where's she going?

656
00:39:17,365 --> 00:39:20,436
We found some records
on your biological mother.

657
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:23,673
You'll be glad to know she's
doing well in Hong Kong.

658
00:39:23,706 --> 00:39:25,240
Thanks, it means a lot.

659
00:39:27,143 --> 00:39:29,912
You wouldn't happen to know
who and where my father is.

660
00:39:30,947 --> 00:39:32,148
We're working on that.

661
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:35,051
Don't worry.

662
00:39:36,052 --> 00:39:37,252
I'm sure he's out there.

663
00:39:42,058 --> 00:39:44,127
Can I ask you something?

664
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,628
Sure.

665
00:39:45,661 --> 00:39:49,232
I lost my close friends,
Dr. Jansen lost her sister.

666
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:52,468
But you, what did
they do to you?

667
00:39:52,502 --> 00:39:56,338
What could possibly be so
wrong that you can't share?

668
00:39:57,607 --> 00:39:59,742
That
doesn't matter now.

669
00:39:59,776 --> 00:40:00,843
It does to me.

670
00:40:00,877 --> 00:40:02,445
Why?

671
00:40:02,478 --> 00:40:05,581
Isn't avenging your
friends motivation enough?

672
00:40:05,615 --> 00:40:07,049
No, it's not.

673
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:12,822
I love them, but I have to think

674
00:40:12,855 --> 00:40:15,124
that they're in a better place.

675
00:40:15,158 --> 00:40:19,262
If they were taken by
the Ash, they're not free.

676
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:20,563
How do you know that?

677
00:40:22,198 --> 00:40:24,100
You're not ready yet.

678
00:40:24,133 --> 00:40:26,135
I believe in what
you're doing here.

679
00:40:26,169 --> 00:40:27,436
I just need to understand.

680
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,971
I said you're not ready yet.

681
00:40:32,008 --> 00:40:36,445
But as I know you more, I am
confident you will be soon.

682
00:40:51,861 --> 00:40:53,162
Jim, Jim, Jim.

683
00:40:54,463 --> 00:40:55,264
Oh, Jim.

684
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,401
Jim.

685
00:41:02,471 --> 00:41:04,006
People observing us.

686
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,474
Can you hear what
they're saying?

687
00:41:06,676 --> 00:41:07,476
No.

688
00:41:08,444 --> 00:41:09,912
Talking about you.

689
00:41:09,946 --> 00:41:12,048
Seems to be
happening a lot lately.

690
00:41:12,081 --> 00:41:13,316
How can you trust them?

691
00:41:14,784 --> 00:41:16,252
They've given me
no reason not to.

692
00:41:16,285 --> 00:41:17,587
Is that all you got?

693
00:41:19,222 --> 00:41:20,056
Your opinion?

694
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,392
What are you talking about?

695
00:41:23,426 --> 00:41:24,594
Look around you, Jim.

696
00:41:26,729 --> 00:41:28,464
The answer's right
in front of you.

697
00:41:43,412 --> 00:41:45,982
This
is getting us nowhere.

698
00:42:02,531 --> 00:42:05,635
seeing Angela and I
together must be hard.

699
00:42:05,668 --> 00:42:07,403
I'm gonna ask
Angela to marry me.

700
00:42:07,436 --> 00:42:09,405
- Seth.
- Try to get him back.

701
00:42:13,376 --> 00:42:16,779
He was about to
marry the love of your life.

702
00:42:16,812 --> 00:42:18,414
She's better off without me.

703
00:42:22,652 --> 00:42:24,320
Nothing can stop us.

704
00:42:30,126 --> 00:42:33,162
Did you even tell
Angela why you left?

705
00:42:33,195 --> 00:42:34,664
That you can't have kids?

706
00:42:35,932 --> 00:42:36,999
You're a coward, Jim.

707
00:43:34,023 --> 00:43:35,825
We plug into a
socket and the energy

708
00:43:35,858 --> 00:43:37,960
that flows out is blue.

709
00:43:37,994 --> 00:43:40,663
Why is the energy that
comes from the RUNTs orange?

710
00:43:40,696 --> 00:43:42,665
The orange energy
is like a filtered,

711
00:43:42,698 --> 00:43:45,901
lower energy than blue
energy, so you don't get hurt.

712
00:43:45,935 --> 00:43:48,804
If they were firing blue energy,
you would hurt a lot more.

713
00:43:48,838 --> 00:43:50,139
Trust me.

714
00:43:50,172 --> 00:43:51,441
You're an engineer, right?

715
00:43:51,475 --> 00:43:53,075
Is all energy the same?

716
00:43:53,109 --> 00:43:54,310
No, no, no, no, no.

717
00:43:54,343 --> 00:43:56,380
There's light energy,
heat, gravitational,

718
00:43:56,413 --> 00:44:00,816
mechanical, electrical, sound,
chemical, atomic, and so on.

719
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:02,452
But that's not the question.

720
00:44:03,786 --> 00:44:05,788
Do you know what the
billion dollar question is?

721
00:44:05,821 --> 00:44:07,656
I don't know,
I failed physics.

722
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:10,159
Aren't all Asians
good at physics?

723
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:11,927
Is that the question?

724
00:44:11,961 --> 00:44:14,663
No, I was kidding.

725
00:44:14,697 --> 00:44:19,702
Okay, the real question is,
is not all energy the same,

726
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:23,407
it's are these new
energies that we've

727
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,573
never discovered before-

728
00:44:24,607 --> 00:44:25,941
- Can you stop
asking me questions?

729
00:44:25,975 --> 00:44:28,512
Okay, this energy
doesn't seem to flow

730
00:44:28,544 --> 00:44:30,846
from any traditional
power plant.

731
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,915
It's not in any
of the textbooks.

732
00:44:32,948 --> 00:44:35,985
Now, Einstein said energy is
neither created nor destroyed.

733
00:44:36,018 --> 00:44:38,721
Then it had to have
come from somewhere.

734
00:44:38,754 --> 00:44:41,090
Where does the energy to
this building come from?

735
00:44:42,291 --> 00:44:44,693
I've never checked, but...

736
00:44:45,728 --> 00:44:47,563
It's gotta be
somewhere close, right?

737
00:44:53,903 --> 00:44:55,871
Hey, I'e checked all the
cameras for a generator room,

738
00:44:55,905 --> 00:44:57,973
- nothing's popping up.
- That's impossible.

739
00:44:58,007 --> 00:45:01,610
Well, a generator for this
size facility would be massive.

740
00:45:01,644 --> 00:45:04,046
This entire facility is
covered in security cameras.

741
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,781
If it were here,
we would see it.

742
00:45:05,815 --> 00:45:08,084
Check the security
drawings, or maybe

743
00:45:08,117 --> 00:45:09,585
the power lines go somewhere.

744
00:45:11,287 --> 00:45:12,888
Okay, pulling it up.

745
00:45:15,124 --> 00:45:15,958
Nothing.

746
00:45:18,528 --> 00:45:19,628
That we can see.

747
00:45:21,531 --> 00:45:23,199
I mean, it wouldn't
be listed, right?

748
00:45:23,232 --> 00:45:24,066
Hold up.

749
00:45:25,601 --> 00:45:27,636
- What?
- Wait a second.

750
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:29,271
There's a room where
all the power lines

751
00:45:29,305 --> 00:45:30,639
seem to feed into.

752
00:45:31,874 --> 00:45:33,142
Where?

753
00:45:33,175 --> 00:45:34,310
It's in the gauntlet.

754
00:45:35,277 --> 00:45:37,079
- You can't be serious.
- Yeah.

755
00:45:39,549 --> 00:45:40,383
She's right.

756
00:45:42,552 --> 00:45:43,719
How do we get there?

757
00:45:43,752 --> 00:45:45,888
Well, it's technically
near the exit, but-

758
00:45:45,921 --> 00:45:47,022
It's blocked.

759
00:45:47,056 --> 00:45:47,990
Sectioned off.

760
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:50,659
According to the
gauntlet design schematics,

761
00:45:50,693 --> 00:45:53,095
these barriers will move
if we beat level eight.

762
00:45:54,263 --> 00:45:55,465
No one's ever
beat level eight.

763
00:45:55,499 --> 00:45:56,699
Captain Linden and his
team have come close.

764
00:45:56,732 --> 00:45:58,367
Yeah, the keyword's close.

765
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:02,271
There's no way.

766
00:46:02,304 --> 00:46:04,206
- Just hear him out.
- Why?

767
00:46:05,341 --> 00:46:06,909
Let's say you can
infiltrate the tower.

768
00:46:06,942 --> 00:46:10,146
Get the map, relay the
codes, and diffuse the bomb.

769
00:46:10,179 --> 00:46:12,582
Do you even know what the pain
threshold is on level eight?

770
00:46:12,616 --> 00:46:13,716
I understand the risks.

771
00:46:13,749 --> 00:46:15,485
No you don't.

772
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:17,686
On level eight, hardcore
mode is enabled.

773
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,489
Which means anything
that can cause damage,

774
00:46:19,523 --> 00:46:21,924
like explosives or
ammo, could kill.

775
00:46:21,957 --> 00:46:24,827
That's why we never
train on level eight.

776
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,695
Cap, listen, he's right.

777
00:46:26,729 --> 00:46:28,465
We never truly questioned the
way things work around here-

778
00:46:28,498 --> 00:46:30,467
- It's not our job
to question orders.

779
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,867
It's not a job, Cap.

780
00:46:31,901 --> 00:46:33,669
Well, count me out.

781
00:46:33,702 --> 00:46:36,573
And consider yourself off my
team if you help these guys.

782
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:38,874
Cap!

783
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:46,849
Maybe you should
sit this one out.

784
00:46:49,685 --> 00:46:51,454
What are you talking about?

785
00:46:51,488 --> 00:46:52,321
I'm in.

786
00:46:55,024 --> 00:46:55,858
Excuse me.

787
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,361
Cap.

788
00:46:59,396 --> 00:47:00,597
Cap!

789
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:01,531
He's gonna get us
all killed, Bell.

790
00:47:01,565 --> 00:47:02,932
You don't know that.

791
00:47:02,965 --> 00:47:05,067
Do you remember what happened
last time we tried this?

792
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,536
Yeah.

793
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:08,938
He's not the first, he's
not gonna be the last.

794
00:47:08,971 --> 00:47:10,674
We have to give him a chance!

795
00:47:10,706 --> 00:47:12,475
I'm not losing another
person I care about-

796
00:47:12,509 --> 00:47:14,210
- You care?

797
00:47:14,243 --> 00:47:15,344
No one is gonna die!

798
00:47:15,377 --> 00:47:16,312
How do you know that?

799
00:47:16,345 --> 00:47:17,681
Because, he's....

800
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:22,918
Don't let your
feelings for him-

801
00:47:22,952 --> 00:47:24,588
- Whoa.

802
00:47:24,621 --> 00:47:26,121
Feelings?

803
00:47:26,155 --> 00:47:26,989
Yeah.

804
00:47:28,123 --> 00:47:29,693
Who said anything
about feelings?

805
00:47:33,597 --> 00:47:35,064
Are you jealous?

806
00:47:36,198 --> 00:47:37,733
No.

807
00:47:37,766 --> 00:47:39,703
That's...

808
00:47:39,735 --> 00:47:40,769
Let's be clear.

809
00:47:42,371 --> 00:47:45,408
This is why we are all here.

810
00:47:45,442 --> 00:47:46,842
Okay?

811
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:49,845
We tried before and now we
finally have a shot at answers.

812
00:47:49,878 --> 00:47:51,847
It's not happening, Bell.

813
00:48:02,626 --> 00:48:03,460
Okay guys.

814
00:48:04,394 --> 00:48:05,528
Level eight is booting.

815
00:48:06,696 --> 00:48:08,665
Hardcore mode enabled.

816
00:48:08,698 --> 00:48:12,334
Alert, game impacts
can be fatal.

817
00:48:13,436 --> 00:48:14,671
- So the tower?
- Mm-hmm.

818
00:48:14,704 --> 00:48:15,538
Yeah.

819
00:48:18,274 --> 00:48:20,042
So you were jealous.

820
00:48:20,075 --> 00:48:22,044
You're still off
the team after this.

821
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,716
Okay, we go stealth on stage one

822
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:28,250
and take the hill
that has the map.

823
00:48:28,284 --> 00:48:29,386
Jim, you're with me.

824
00:48:29,419 --> 00:48:30,319
Five.

825
00:48:30,352 --> 00:48:31,120
You three on the right.

826
00:48:31,153 --> 00:48:32,622
Four.

827
00:48:32,656 --> 00:48:33,456
Three.

828
00:48:34,323 --> 00:48:35,991
- Two.
- Copy that.

829
00:48:36,025 --> 00:48:37,694
- One.
- Game starting.

830
00:48:37,727 --> 00:48:38,827
Active.

831
00:48:56,413 --> 00:48:57,246
On you.

832
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,674
Okay.

833
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:27,142
Code room is in the
upper left quadrant.

834
00:49:27,176 --> 00:49:29,244
Bomb is located center right.

835
00:49:29,278 --> 00:49:30,747
Bell and Aaron,
head to the code room,

836
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,047
Jim and I go to the
bomb for diffusing.

837
00:49:32,081 --> 00:49:32,915
- Got it.
- Go.

838
00:49:50,633 --> 00:49:52,702
You've been practicing.

839
00:49:52,736 --> 00:49:54,203
A little.

840
00:49:54,236 --> 00:49:56,038
You're doing great, guys.

841
00:50:06,716 --> 00:50:08,250
We're in.

842
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,856
Okay guys, get on
decoding the module

843
00:50:12,888 --> 00:50:13,956
in order to diffuse the bomb.

844
00:50:13,989 --> 00:50:15,324
You got five minutes.

845
00:50:16,626 --> 00:50:18,695
You ready with
the codes, Aaron?

846
00:50:18,728 --> 00:50:19,562
Yep.

847
00:50:21,631 --> 00:50:22,465
Sigma.

848
00:50:25,802 --> 00:50:26,636
Four.

849
00:50:28,904 --> 00:50:29,739
Beta.

850
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,040
Eight.

851
00:50:32,074 --> 00:50:32,908
That it?

852
00:50:34,477 --> 00:50:35,344
Almost there.

853
00:50:37,547 --> 00:50:38,448
What happened?

854
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:40,215
You gave to the main symbol?

855
00:50:40,249 --> 00:50:41,917
Are you sure that was beta?

856
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:44,153
I told you it
wasn't good at math.

857
00:50:44,186 --> 00:50:45,320
You said physics.

858
00:50:45,354 --> 00:50:46,823
Same thing!

859
00:50:46,856 --> 00:50:47,657
Get going, guys.

860
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:48,924
Come on.

861
00:50:48,957 --> 00:50:49,958
Okay, let's move
on to wire cutting.

862
00:50:49,992 --> 00:50:51,260
That's our only way.

863
00:50:57,634 --> 00:50:58,435
A1.

864
00:51:00,035 --> 00:51:01,738
- Yes.
- One minute left.

865
00:51:01,771 --> 00:51:02,605
Hurry!

866
00:51:06,175 --> 00:51:07,309
Another wave coming.

867
00:51:07,342 --> 00:51:09,077
Let's get this.

868
00:51:10,279 --> 00:51:11,079
D2 to B3.

869
00:51:13,516 --> 00:51:14,417
D2 to B3.

870
00:51:15,819 --> 00:51:17,821
None of them are listed.

871
00:51:17,854 --> 00:51:20,457
That's exactly what
happened last time.

872
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:25,994
Bell's hit.

873
00:51:26,028 --> 00:51:27,262
It's unbeatable.

874
00:51:27,296 --> 00:51:28,363
Abort mission.

875
00:51:28,398 --> 00:51:30,733
Billy, Aaron, get out of there.

876
00:51:30,767 --> 00:51:31,601
Let's go, Jim.

877
00:51:35,204 --> 00:51:36,706
Right behind you.

878
00:51:36,739 --> 00:51:40,643
They're not gonna make it.

879
00:51:53,021 --> 00:51:54,289
There's a 50-50 chance.

880
00:51:59,127 --> 00:52:00,362
Where's Jim?

881
00:52:00,396 --> 00:52:01,263
What are you doing?

882
00:52:01,296 --> 00:52:02,932
It's a 50-50 chance.

883
00:52:04,667 --> 00:52:07,403
Jim,
get out of there!

884
00:52:13,977 --> 00:52:15,845
What's wrong, Slim Jim?

885
00:52:15,879 --> 00:52:17,246
Didn't see my foot?

886
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,782
Couldn't tell if your
eyes were open or not.

887
00:52:21,016 --> 00:52:22,184
Oh my god, you know,
for three seconds

888
00:52:22,217 --> 00:52:23,653
you were worth something.

889
00:52:23,686 --> 00:52:26,355
I'm sorry, I just can't
accept these grades, buddy.

890
00:52:26,389 --> 00:52:27,924
I think he shouldn't eat it.

891
00:52:27,957 --> 00:52:29,859
That's a brilliant idea.

892
00:52:29,893 --> 00:52:31,661
Should make him
eat all of them.

893
00:52:31,694 --> 00:52:33,128
Every F.

894
00:52:33,161 --> 00:52:35,732
Why you still down, boy?

895
00:52:35,765 --> 00:52:38,735
Thought you were born with
self-defense mechanisms.

896
00:52:41,103 --> 00:52:43,439
Do you think anyone
actually cares about you?

897
00:52:45,173 --> 00:52:47,376
The only reason you're
here is to fill the void

898
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:49,278
for you're infertile
mommy and daddy.

899
00:53:09,866 --> 00:53:10,700
Very good, Jim.

900
00:53:11,601 --> 00:53:12,769
I thought I was dead.

901
00:53:14,169 --> 00:53:17,205
The bomb was merely to stun
you, as I had designed it.

902
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:20,342
I'm sorry, the stakes
had to be high.

903
00:53:21,411 --> 00:53:23,646
- The team?
- Oh, they're fine.

904
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,080
I've talked to them already.

905
00:53:26,315 --> 00:53:28,751
I never thought anybody
could beat level eight.

906
00:53:30,218 --> 00:53:31,821
Did they get to the generator?

907
00:53:33,288 --> 00:53:35,324
I assumed like
the others, you were

908
00:53:36,459 --> 00:53:38,494
only interested in
avenging your friends

909
00:53:41,731 --> 00:53:43,666
Because after my son died...

910
00:53:50,807 --> 00:53:52,107
He was a Navy SEAL.

911
00:53:53,643 --> 00:53:56,012
He hated everything I stood for.

912
00:53:56,579 --> 00:54:01,283
I never told him about
my dealings, but he knew.

913
00:54:05,354 --> 00:54:07,255
The Kinians asked
me to invite him

914
00:54:07,289 --> 00:54:09,626
to one of my vacation homes.

915
00:54:11,226 --> 00:54:15,230
He didn't want to visit
me, but I begged him.

916
00:54:18,501 --> 00:54:20,570
I thought they were
just gonna scare him.

917
00:54:22,071 --> 00:54:24,373
But they used the
red Ash on him,

918
00:54:24,407 --> 00:54:26,809
and it made him give
up all his intel.

919
00:54:28,478 --> 00:54:31,648
Names of undercover agents,
missions for the government,

920
00:54:31,681 --> 00:54:32,482
everything.

921
00:54:34,484 --> 00:54:35,952
Then they killed him.

922
00:54:38,688 --> 00:54:41,658
They said he was too
dangerous to keep alive.

923
00:54:44,661 --> 00:54:47,397
I myself was consumed
with revenge.

924
00:54:49,699 --> 00:54:53,235
But after a long spiritual
journey, I let go.

925
00:54:53,268 --> 00:54:56,472
And when I did,
that's when I realized

926
00:54:56,506 --> 00:54:59,174
the Ash with a human soul.

927
00:54:59,207 --> 00:55:01,376
That's where it gets its energy.

928
00:55:01,411 --> 00:55:05,715
The human soul is a life
force, regenerative.

929
00:55:05,748 --> 00:55:07,950
Can expand or contract.

930
00:55:09,385 --> 00:55:11,988
And one of the most
powerful energies we know.

931
00:55:13,923 --> 00:55:15,323
It can power this facility.

932
00:55:20,596 --> 00:55:23,599
Just 10 seconds of my
life energy, or mana,

933
00:55:25,001 --> 00:55:28,171
is enough to power this
facility for an entire day.

934
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:34,644
You can power this
facility by yourself?

935
00:55:36,278 --> 00:55:39,281
Have you ever heard the term
ashes to ashes, dust to dust?

936
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:42,217
How do you think the
Earth's population

937
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:44,087
is able to continue to grow?

938
00:55:45,421 --> 00:55:47,657
When someone dies they're
supposed to return

939
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:48,891
to a pool of mana.

940
00:55:48,925 --> 00:55:52,061
This facility is built
on top of a small pool.

941
00:55:52,095 --> 00:55:53,996
You are not consumed
with revenge.

942
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:57,467
Rather, you are fueled with
purpose to help others.

943
00:56:00,703 --> 00:56:02,270
I'm no one.

944
00:56:02,304 --> 00:56:04,507
Ah, you are more than that.

945
00:56:06,308 --> 00:56:09,812
And I will help you achieve
your true potential.

946
00:56:13,049 --> 00:56:14,484
Place your hand there.

947
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:24,961
It's there, Jim.

948
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:30,233
Through training with
me, you will learn.

949
00:56:37,507 --> 00:56:38,340
Breathe.

950
00:56:41,811 --> 00:56:43,246
To be selfless...

951
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:49,652
One must trust others.

952
00:56:49,685 --> 00:56:52,655
So it's not a big machine
powering this place?

953
00:56:52,688 --> 00:56:53,523
Far from it.

954
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:04,834
Again.

955
00:57:06,269 --> 00:57:07,537
But first...

956
00:57:13,209 --> 00:57:14,010
Nice.

957
00:57:14,043 --> 00:57:14,877
Good.

958
00:57:15,945 --> 00:57:17,413
Bell, you're up next.

959
00:57:17,446 --> 00:57:18,313
Choose a partner.

960
00:57:20,216 --> 00:57:21,851
I choose Jim.

961
00:57:21,884 --> 00:57:22,718
What?

962
00:57:28,624 --> 00:57:30,059
I don't want to hit a...

963
00:57:31,727 --> 00:57:32,562
Girl?

964
00:57:34,564 --> 00:57:36,566
You must trust yourself.

965
00:57:38,501 --> 00:57:40,102
What if it wasn't just any girl?

966
00:57:40,136 --> 00:57:41,137
All right.

967
00:57:43,172 --> 00:57:44,841
What if it was
your girlfriend?

968
00:57:49,278 --> 00:57:51,914
Now let's do one, two.

969
00:57:51,948 --> 00:57:54,717
Slip, uppercut, bam,
blow underneath.

970
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:55,585
Left hook.

971
00:57:57,453 --> 00:57:59,021
To be selfless...

972
00:58:00,756 --> 00:58:02,859
Is to give of oneself.

973
00:58:02,892 --> 00:58:05,561
Wanna think of
turning the hip over,

974
00:58:05,595 --> 00:58:07,797
keeping that knee
parallel to the ground

975
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:08,998
as you swing and kick.

976
00:58:09,031 --> 00:58:09,866
Let me see it.

977
00:58:12,602 --> 00:58:14,003
Wholeheartedly.

978
00:58:23,913 --> 00:58:25,414
You're getting it.

979
00:58:26,482 --> 00:58:27,316
Yeah.

980
00:58:32,121 --> 00:58:33,856
What do you think?

981
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:36,225
He's the best we
could have hoped for.

982
00:58:36,259 --> 00:58:37,693
Dedicated.

983
00:58:37,727 --> 00:58:39,328
Driven.

984
00:58:39,362 --> 00:58:41,030
I worry it's not enough.

985
00:58:42,798 --> 00:58:45,568
If he's
anything like you...

986
00:58:45,601 --> 00:58:48,638
We should keep testing
him, pushing his limits.

987
00:58:48,671 --> 00:58:49,605
See what...

988
00:58:50,539 --> 00:58:51,407
I understand.

989
00:58:52,575 --> 00:58:55,778
But knowing more can have a
huge impact on Project Alpha.

990
00:58:56,545 --> 00:58:58,614
That meditation stuff.

991
00:58:59,749 --> 00:59:01,617
It's never going to work.

992
00:59:03,052 --> 00:59:05,821
I need more lab resources
to do the genetic analysis.

993
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:08,624
It can't just pay me in
some new doctor doing it.

994
00:59:11,427 --> 00:59:13,362
Look at this place,
it's falling apart.

995
00:59:20,836 --> 00:59:25,541
Do you think it's easy
funding an operation like this?

996
00:59:25,574 --> 00:59:28,144
There are forces that are
freezing my bank accounts.

997
00:59:28,177 --> 00:59:31,914
I need to offshore my finances,
and cannot be detected.

998
00:59:31,948 --> 00:59:35,385
When's the last time that you
had to think about funding?

999
00:59:35,419 --> 00:59:36,819
You think it just happens?

1000
00:59:38,154 --> 00:59:40,589
People take this for
granted, but it's a process,

1001
00:59:40,623 --> 00:59:44,694
and there are limits so
we can remain undetected.

1002
00:59:47,596 --> 00:59:48,432
Yes, sir.

1003
00:59:56,038 --> 00:59:58,240
I cannot believe that you
got them to deliver this

1004
00:59:58,274 --> 00:59:59,542
all the way out here.

1005
00:59:59,575 --> 01:00:00,743
- What?
- Yeah.

1006
01:00:00,776 --> 01:00:01,677
You're amazing.

1007
01:00:03,879 --> 01:00:06,615
The guy definitely
got a big tip.

1008
01:00:07,451 --> 01:00:08,284
Good.

1009
01:00:23,499 --> 01:00:24,333
He loved you.

1010
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:29,772
I just wish she hadn't
wanted to visit me.

1011
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:37,279
It was my fault.

1012
01:00:37,313 --> 01:00:40,116
I kept talking
about you so much.

1013
01:00:40,149 --> 01:00:42,419
He practically planned
the whole trip for me.

1014
01:00:44,421 --> 01:00:46,222
Why'd you leave, Jim?

1015
01:00:47,723 --> 01:00:49,125
Was it 'cause of my job?

1016
01:00:49,158 --> 01:00:51,927
I know that I can get
consumed with work sometimes.

1017
01:00:51,961 --> 01:00:53,329
No.

1018
01:00:53,362 --> 01:00:54,431
No, no, it was...

1019
01:00:56,032 --> 01:00:59,101
I love every part
of that about you.

1020
01:00:59,135 --> 01:01:01,237
You'd come home
from the hospital,

1021
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:02,905
talking about delivering babies.

1022
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:09,879
Made me want to
be a good person.

1023
01:01:09,912 --> 01:01:11,781
You are a good person.

1024
01:01:11,814 --> 01:01:12,648
No I'm not.

1025
01:01:15,785 --> 01:01:16,786
Not if I hurt you.

1026
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,655
You'd never hurt me.

1027
01:01:25,561 --> 01:01:27,763
I can't have children, Ange.

1028
01:01:29,999 --> 01:01:30,833
So?

1029
01:01:31,734 --> 01:01:34,136
So, you love children.

1030
01:01:36,038 --> 01:01:37,407
We could adopt.

1031
01:01:40,176 --> 01:01:41,411
And what?

1032
01:01:41,445 --> 01:01:42,978
Do you know what it was
like for me growing up?

1033
01:01:43,012 --> 01:01:43,913
How can I?

1034
01:01:43,946 --> 01:01:45,382
You never talked to me about it.

1035
01:01:45,415 --> 01:01:46,615
You don't want to hear it.

1036
01:01:46,649 --> 01:01:48,150
Why are you always
trying to protect me?

1037
01:01:48,184 --> 01:01:50,786
'Cause no one protected me
when I was growing up, okay?

1038
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:52,221
My adoptive parents?

1039
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:57,593
When they had to bail me out
jail, they gave up on me.

1040
01:02:02,164 --> 01:02:06,436
Do you know what it's like
to be abandoned twice?

1041
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:07,269
Come here.

1042
01:02:12,542 --> 01:02:15,077
There's nothing you
could ever tell me

1043
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:18,681
that would make me
abandon you, okay?

1044
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:35,164
Jim.

1045
01:02:36,198 --> 01:02:37,567
How's Angela?

1046
01:02:37,601 --> 01:02:38,535
She's fine.

1047
01:02:40,369 --> 01:02:41,737
She's your weakness, Jim.

1048
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:44,608
How so?

1049
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:45,808
Because you care.

1050
01:02:49,945 --> 01:02:50,813
What about you?

1051
01:02:52,482 --> 01:02:53,916
You still care about anybody?

1052
01:02:55,885 --> 01:02:56,952
Not even your wife?

1053
01:03:01,023 --> 01:03:01,824
Your son?

1054
01:03:03,692 --> 01:03:04,494
No.

1055
01:03:05,961 --> 01:03:07,029
You sure?

1056
01:03:07,062 --> 01:03:07,930
What was his name?

1057
01:03:12,701 --> 01:03:13,537
No.

1058
01:03:15,004 --> 01:03:17,072
- What about your son, John?
- No.

1059
01:03:17,106 --> 01:03:20,410
Shut up!

1060
01:03:20,443 --> 01:03:22,111
What about him?

1061
01:03:22,144 --> 01:03:22,978
Shut up!

1062
01:03:24,046 --> 01:03:24,847
Shut up.

1063
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,550
What about your son?

1064
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:27,384
No.

1065
01:03:34,757 --> 01:03:36,058
What abt your son!

1066
01:03:42,666 --> 01:03:43,832
Jim.

1067
01:03:43,866 --> 01:03:45,468
You have to find a
way to reach me, okay?

1068
01:03:45,502 --> 01:03:46,302
John.

1069
01:03:48,471 --> 01:03:49,772
John.

1070
01:03:56,845 --> 01:03:59,949
This is crazy and dangerous.

1071
01:03:59,982 --> 01:04:02,586
Can we at least wait
a day or two for this?

1072
01:04:02,619 --> 01:04:03,886
Let's run more tests.

1073
01:04:03,919 --> 01:04:05,321
See what our options are.

1074
01:04:05,354 --> 01:04:07,156
I'm not sure if
John can hold out.

1075
01:04:09,392 --> 01:04:10,493
We should keep going.

1076
01:04:12,161 --> 01:04:14,730
Alastair, we don't know
what's on the other side.

1077
01:04:15,965 --> 01:04:16,932
He could die.

1078
01:04:21,504 --> 01:04:23,473
Jim, it's not worth it.

1079
01:04:27,677 --> 01:04:28,511
Alastair.

1080
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:35,050
What do you need?

1081
01:04:36,285 --> 01:04:39,054
To be selfless is
to trust oneself.

1082
01:04:47,796 --> 01:04:49,298
He's ready.

1083
01:04:52,469 --> 01:04:53,302
Good luck.

1084
01:05:13,757 --> 01:05:15,057
I'm sorry, I didn't order any.

1085
01:05:15,090 --> 01:05:15,991
It's on the house.

1086
01:05:16,025 --> 01:05:17,026
You look like you need it.

1087
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:18,794
Thank you.

1088
01:05:21,464 --> 01:05:22,699
We're in the same school.

1089
01:05:23,832 --> 01:05:24,734
Yeah.

1090
01:05:24,768 --> 01:05:25,568
We're in the same math class.

1091
01:05:25,602 --> 01:05:27,069
Mr. Jenkins's class.

1092
01:05:27,102 --> 01:05:30,172
I'm always in the back,
you're always in the front.

1093
01:05:30,205 --> 01:05:32,609
Otherwise you'd
probably recognize me.

1094
01:05:32,642 --> 01:05:33,777
Oh, I recognize you.

1095
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:36,680
Do you work here?

1096
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:38,947
What am I saying?

1097
01:05:38,981 --> 01:05:39,882
Of course you do.

1098
01:05:39,915 --> 01:05:40,816
I'm saving up to go to college

1099
01:05:40,849 --> 01:05:42,519
and then go to medical school.

1100
01:05:42,552 --> 01:05:43,952
Why?

1101
01:05:43,986 --> 01:05:46,021
I mean, these days it's
better to work on Wall Street

1102
01:05:46,055 --> 01:05:47,923
and make a lot of money.

1103
01:05:47,956 --> 01:05:49,392
Doctors don't
make a lot of money

1104
01:05:49,426 --> 01:05:51,795
for the years they put in,
but you can't put a price tag

1105
01:05:51,827 --> 01:05:53,463
on helping a mother and
father bring a new life

1106
01:05:53,496 --> 01:05:54,830
into this world.

1107
01:05:54,863 --> 01:05:57,734
I wouldn't know what it's like

1108
01:05:57,767 --> 01:05:59,703
to have a mother and father.

1109
01:05:59,736 --> 01:06:01,471
I'm sorry.

1110
01:06:01,504 --> 01:06:04,641
How do you know that you
want to become a doctor?

1111
01:06:05,508 --> 01:06:06,776
I just told you.

1112
01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:10,447
But how did you start?

1113
01:06:11,347 --> 01:06:12,147
Babysitting.

1114
01:06:12,181 --> 01:06:14,551
Not kids, but babies.

1115
01:06:14,584 --> 01:06:15,385
Really?

1116
01:06:15,418 --> 01:06:16,218
Really.

1117
01:06:16,251 --> 01:06:17,687
Like what?

1118
01:06:17,721 --> 01:06:20,055
Like everything, you know,
that they're so helpless

1119
01:06:20,089 --> 01:06:22,124
and all they want is your love.

1120
01:06:22,157 --> 01:06:23,626
They know nothing else.

1121
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:25,260
They've yet to know about
all the things in life,

1122
01:06:25,294 --> 01:06:28,431
like fancy cars,
big house, you know,

1123
01:06:28,465 --> 01:06:31,266
none of which will
make you truly happy.

1124
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:32,736
It's a gift to care for a baby

1125
01:06:32,769 --> 01:06:34,838
because you have to be selfless.

1126
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:37,774
You can't at any point
just stop caring for one.

1127
01:06:40,477 --> 01:06:41,944
So you wanna be a doctor now?

1128
01:06:42,779 --> 01:06:44,346
No, but thank you.

1129
01:06:45,615 --> 01:06:47,617
Maybe I'll find
something to do someday.

1130
01:06:48,785 --> 01:06:49,619
Just like you.

1131
01:06:50,919 --> 01:06:51,755
You will.

1132
01:07:07,704 --> 01:07:09,004
You have to be selfless.

1133
01:07:10,205 --> 01:07:13,208
Maybe I'll find
something to do someday.

1134
01:07:13,242 --> 01:07:14,076
Like you.

1135
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:42,271
I've been waiting for you.

1136
01:07:44,741 --> 01:07:45,675
Where are we?

1137
01:07:47,976 --> 01:07:48,812
I don't know.

1138
01:07:50,279 --> 01:07:51,681
My soul.

1139
01:07:51,714 --> 01:07:52,549
My mind.

1140
01:07:53,949 --> 01:07:54,751
A little bit of both.

1141
01:07:54,784 --> 01:07:55,752
I'm not quite sure.

1142
01:07:59,556 --> 01:08:01,190
We used to take my son here.

1143
01:08:06,696 --> 01:08:07,630
It's beautiful.

1144
01:08:08,832 --> 01:08:10,365
Ah.

1145
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,634
You're in my house now.

1146
01:08:13,636 --> 01:08:15,337
I wouldn't show you
the garage first.

1147
01:08:21,109 --> 01:08:22,779
What do we do now?

1148
01:08:24,747 --> 01:08:26,014
I don't know.

1149
01:08:27,383 --> 01:08:32,221
But what I do know is that
selflessness is to trust others.

1150
01:08:45,334 --> 01:08:46,569
So trust Alastair.

1151
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:48,438
Hey Jim.

1152
01:08:50,607 --> 01:08:52,007
Tell my son I love him.

1153
01:09:44,827 --> 01:09:45,628
You're fine.

1154
01:09:49,399 --> 01:09:50,800
I'm sorry about this, Jim.

1155
01:09:52,468 --> 01:09:53,803
Let's see if this kills you.

1156
01:10:55,798 --> 01:10:56,866
Seth?

1157
01:11:12,615 --> 01:11:13,883
Send me back.

1158
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:16,184
Where?

1159
01:11:31,299 --> 01:11:32,502
What else did you see?

1160
01:11:34,336 --> 01:11:35,872
The mana.

1161
01:11:35,905 --> 01:11:37,607
They want all of Earth's mana.

1162
01:11:41,511 --> 01:11:42,344
Here.

1163
01:11:44,013 --> 01:11:44,914
Take this.

1164
01:11:48,418 --> 01:11:49,385
It belonged to him.

1165
01:11:52,287 --> 01:11:53,823
He was a great warrior.

1166
01:11:55,091 --> 01:11:56,224
And a great man.

1167
01:11:59,462 --> 01:12:00,596
Just like you.

1168
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:02,297
We're getting you outta here.

1169
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:03,298
No, it's too late.

1170
01:12:05,735 --> 01:12:06,602
There's so much...

1171
01:12:24,454 --> 01:12:25,455
Thank you.

1172
01:12:34,262 --> 01:12:35,765
The RUNTs.

1173
01:12:35,798 --> 01:12:37,033
They've gone berserk.

1174
01:12:37,066 --> 01:12:39,602
She's reprogrammed
them to kill humans.

1175
01:12:39,635 --> 01:12:42,237
I was just at the
main exit, it's blocked.

1176
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:44,040
We should move for
Alastair's ship, then.

1177
01:12:44,073 --> 01:12:44,907
Where's Angela?

1178
01:12:47,877 --> 01:12:49,212
She's trapped in the lab.

1179
01:12:50,345 --> 01:12:51,681
I gotta get to her.

1180
01:12:51,714 --> 01:12:53,248
No, there's no time.

1181
01:12:53,281 --> 01:12:54,884
Leave without me
if I don't make it.

1182
01:12:54,917 --> 01:12:55,752
You'll make it.

1183
01:12:59,789 --> 01:13:00,823
We'll wait for you.

1184
01:13:01,758 --> 01:13:03,258
Let's go.

1185
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:04,093
Here.

1186
01:13:05,495 --> 01:13:06,529
So you can find us.

1187
01:13:26,314 --> 01:13:27,917
Alastair is dead.

1188
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:28,951
Well done.

1189
01:13:30,186 --> 01:13:31,053
My sister.

1190
01:13:33,189 --> 01:13:34,023
She's here.

1191
01:13:38,161 --> 01:13:39,428
Where is she?

1192
01:13:40,730 --> 01:13:42,832
Come, I'll show you.

1193
01:13:42,865 --> 01:13:44,467
No no, no!

1194
01:13:51,774 --> 01:13:53,843
Now we are one.

1195
01:14:33,916 --> 01:14:35,084
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1196
01:14:39,322 --> 01:14:40,756
I got your six.

1197
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:02,445
Angela?

1198
01:15:02,478 --> 01:15:04,013
Jim?

1199
01:15:04,046 --> 01:15:04,914
- Angela!
- Jim!

1200
01:15:08,150 --> 01:15:08,951
Are you okay?

1201
01:15:08,985 --> 01:15:10,086
I'm fine.

1202
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:20,329
Now who's in control, Jim.

1203
01:15:25,268 --> 01:15:26,369
You're pathetic.

1204
01:15:29,238 --> 01:15:31,941
I did love you, too much.

1205
01:15:33,576 --> 01:15:35,778
That's what made me weak.

1206
01:15:35,811 --> 01:15:37,947
Now I'm stronger.

1207
01:15:39,916 --> 01:15:40,750
I'm better.

1208
01:15:45,087 --> 01:15:46,255
Angela.

1209
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:10,313
Isolation
chamber activated.

1210
01:16:10,346 --> 01:16:13,749
Danger, decontamination
process commencing.

1211
01:16:32,501 --> 01:16:33,302
Angela.

1212
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:35,604
What are you doing?

1213
01:16:35,638 --> 01:16:36,605
No, Jim.

1214
01:16:42,678 --> 01:16:43,512
Go.

1215
01:16:45,081 --> 01:16:46,082
No.

1216
01:16:46,115 --> 01:16:46,949
Go!

1217
01:16:48,084 --> 01:16:49,485
I love you.

1218
01:16:49,518 --> 01:16:50,353
Oh, please.

1219
01:16:52,188 --> 01:16:53,390
Don't do this.

1220
01:16:53,423 --> 01:16:54,890
We are
in control, Jim.

1221
01:17:05,501 --> 01:17:07,103
Not working!

1222
01:17:07,136 --> 01:17:07,970
Moving!

1223
01:17:10,474 --> 01:17:11,240
On the right!

1224
01:17:12,608 --> 01:17:16,679
In lockdown.

1225
01:17:19,648 --> 01:17:20,883
Jim, what's your location?

1226
01:17:20,916 --> 01:17:21,817
We're pinned down.

1227
01:17:23,285 --> 01:17:25,321
Jim, what's your con?

1228
01:17:34,163 --> 01:17:35,331
Come on, come on.

1229
01:17:35,364 --> 01:17:36,265
I can't hold
them off forever.

1230
01:17:36,298 --> 01:17:37,501
We're gonna get pinned!

1231
01:18:53,175 --> 01:18:54,610
On your five, on your five.

1232
01:18:58,347 --> 01:18:59,648
- Higgins.
- Huh?

1233
01:18:59,682 --> 01:19:02,651
Can you cut through this?

1234
01:19:02,685 --> 01:19:03,619
No problem.

1235
01:19:03,652 --> 01:19:04,653
I'm on it.

1236
01:20:04,346 --> 01:20:08,451
They keep coming!

1237
01:20:10,986 --> 01:20:12,721
That can't be good.

1238
01:20:14,857 --> 01:20:17,193
There are too many!

1239
01:20:28,605 --> 01:20:29,439
Yes.

1240
01:20:34,109 --> 01:20:35,277
Door open.

1241
01:20:35,311 --> 01:20:36,513
Guys, come on,
come on, let's go.

1242
01:20:36,546 --> 01:20:37,447
Move it.

1243
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:40,149
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1244
01:20:41,116 --> 01:20:42,686
A simple thank you...

1245
01:21:02,771 --> 01:21:04,240
Where are the controls?

1246
01:21:04,273 --> 01:21:06,710
I don't know, you think
they'd have a manual.

1247
01:21:06,742 --> 01:21:07,677
Figure it out.

1248
01:21:07,711 --> 01:21:08,844
We're going back for Jim.

1249
01:21:11,847 --> 01:21:14,183
I've been waiting for you.

1250
01:21:22,726 --> 01:21:25,528
- I'm impressed.
- I'm just getting started.

1251
01:21:31,233 --> 01:21:35,804
Before we left Earth, we
killed all the half-Kinians.

1252
01:21:37,607 --> 01:21:39,676
At least I thought we did.

1253
01:21:39,709 --> 01:21:40,510
What?

1254
01:21:40,543 --> 01:21:41,777
Yes.

1255
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:42,778
You didn't sense it?

1256
01:21:42,811 --> 01:21:43,647
No.

1257
01:21:46,449 --> 01:21:48,385
That's how you
can resist the Ash.

1258
01:21:49,653 --> 01:21:53,889
Humans are much more
easily manipulated.

1259
01:22:00,597 --> 01:22:01,531
Look at Angela.

1260
01:22:02,732 --> 01:22:05,100
Her mind defied
the Ash's control.

1261
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:11,641
But love has no stamina.

1262
01:22:15,612 --> 01:22:17,313
It's so very...

1263
01:22:24,454 --> 01:22:25,287
Delicate.

1264
01:22:27,823 --> 01:22:28,725
Go for the hand.

1265
01:22:30,727 --> 01:22:32,662
When we built
the Ash, we focused

1266
01:22:32,696 --> 01:22:34,631
on harnessing human greed.

1267
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:37,634
Enhancing it.

1268
01:22:39,101 --> 01:22:40,804
Utilizing hate.

1269
01:22:41,837 --> 01:22:44,840
Fear and anger.

1270
01:22:44,873 --> 01:22:47,343
Emotions more accessible.

1271
01:22:53,583 --> 01:22:55,685
I've had enough hate
and anger in my life.

1272
01:22:55,719 --> 01:22:57,554
Never solved any of my problems.

1273
01:22:59,922 --> 01:23:01,825
Sacrifice.

1274
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:04,960
Love.

1275
01:23:07,963 --> 01:23:09,231
Selflessness.

1276
01:23:12,267 --> 01:23:14,069
That's when I turned
my life around.

1277
01:23:16,706 --> 01:23:17,873
That's when I had hope.

1278
01:23:19,542 --> 01:23:24,213
And I'm never going back.

1279
01:23:34,391 --> 01:23:36,291
- Jim!
- Jim, over here!

1280
01:23:38,695 --> 01:23:40,129
There's gotta be a computer.

1281
01:23:40,162 --> 01:23:41,130
Hello.

1282
01:23:42,699 --> 01:23:43,666
That's your name?

1283
01:23:44,501 --> 01:23:45,502
Computer?

1284
01:23:45,535 --> 01:23:46,870
Yes.

1285
01:23:46,935 --> 01:23:48,904
Okay, we're gonna
have to change that.

1286
01:23:50,707 --> 01:23:51,541
Okay.

1287
01:23:52,941 --> 01:23:53,843
Now we're talking.

1288
01:23:55,310 --> 01:23:56,111
I can do this.

1289
01:23:56,145 --> 01:23:56,979
Oh, don't touch that.

1290
01:23:59,416 --> 01:24:00,249
Let's go.

1291
01:24:06,221 --> 01:24:07,624
Took you long enough.

1292
01:24:07,657 --> 01:24:09,526
Computer, start the engines.

1293
01:24:09,559 --> 01:24:10,660
Starting engines.

1294
01:24:10,693 --> 01:24:12,529
- Okay.
- Where to?

1295
01:24:13,962 --> 01:24:16,900
Take us to where
Alastair wants us to go.

1296
01:24:16,932 --> 01:24:17,834
Affirmative.

1297
01:24:22,672 --> 01:24:24,306
How'd you know
to hit the hand?

1298
01:24:25,974 --> 01:24:27,877
Oh, you can thank
Bell for that.

1299
01:24:27,911 --> 01:24:29,446
Take off in three.

1300
01:24:29,479 --> 01:24:30,747
- Lucky guess.
- Two.

1301
01:24:31,648 --> 01:24:32,849
One.

1302
01:24:32,882 --> 01:24:34,183
Engage.

1303
