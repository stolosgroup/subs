3
00:00:55,563 --> 00:00:57,857
<i>My planet
Arrakis is so beautiful</i>

4
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,484
<i>when the sun is low.</i>

5
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:05,406
<i>Rolling over the sands...</i>

6
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,409
<i>you can see spice in the air.</i>

7
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:24,717
<i>At nightfall,
the spice harvesters land.</i>

8
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:28,346
<i>The outsiders
race against time</i>

9
00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:30,765
<i>to avoid the heat of the day.</i>

10
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:43,528
<i>They ravage our lands
in front of our eyes.</i>

11
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:47,532
<i>Their cruelty to my people
is all I've known.</i>

12
00:01:52,203 --> 00:01:54,664
<i>These outsiders,
the Harkonnens,</i>

13
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,749
<i>came long before I was born.</i>

14
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,751
<i>By controlling
spice production,</i>

15
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:00,670
<i>they became obscenely rich.</i>

16
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:03,464
<i>Richer than
the Emperor himself.</i>

17
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:48,634
<i>Our warriors couldn't free
Arrakis from the Harkonnens,</i>

18
00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:49,927
<i>but one day,</i>

19
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:53,347
<i>by Imperial decree,
they were gone.</i>

20
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,607
<i>Why did the Emperor
choose this path?</i>

21
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,402
<i>And who will
our next oppressors be?</i>

22
00:03:57,662 --> 00:03:59,413
It's good you're up early.

23
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,124
Your father wants you
in full dress

24
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,918
before the Emperor's Herald
arrives.

25
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:06,087
Full dress?

26
00:04:07,004 --> 00:04:08,673
Military?

27
00:04:08,756 --> 00:04:11,300
Ceremonial.

28
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,635
Why do we have to go
through all this

29
00:04:12,718 --> 00:04:14,220
when it's already
been decided?

30
00:04:15,304 --> 00:04:16,681
Ceremony.

31
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,391
Mm.

32
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:20,309
Thank you.

33
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,146
If you want it,
make me give it to you.

34
00:04:25,523 --> 00:04:26,440
Use the Voice.

35
00:04:26,524 --> 00:04:28,359
Mom, I just woke up.

36
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:38,619
Give me the water.

37
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:40,997
The glass can't hear you.
Command me.

38
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,443
Give me the water.

39
00:05:22,913 --> 00:05:23,914
Almost.

40
00:05:23,998 --> 00:05:25,374
Almost?

41
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,877
Bene Gesserit skills
take years to learn, Paul.

42
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,838
- Mm-hmm.
- You look tired.

43
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:33,049
More dreams?

44
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:39,722
No.

45
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,310
<i>Extreme temperatures</i>

46
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:46,062
<i>and treacherous weather events</i>

47
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:49,899
<i>make life outside the cities
of Arrakis truly hostile,</i>

48
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,859
<i>with sandstorms
powerful enough</i>

49
00:05:51,942 --> 00:05:53,569
<i>to cut through metal.</i>

50
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:56,364
<i>Only the native tribes
known as the Fremen</i>

51
00:05:56,447 --> 00:06:00,034
<i>have adapted
well enough to survive.</i>

52
00:06:00,117 --> 00:06:04,580
<i>Preferring to inhabit the
remotest regions of Arrakis,</i>

53
00:06:04,663 --> 00:06:06,582
<i>the Fremen share
the deep desert</i>

54
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:08,250
<i>with the giant sandworms</i>

55
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,754
<i>known to the Fremen</i>
<i>as</i> Shai-Hulud.

56
00:06:11,837 --> 00:06:14,423
<i>Long exposure to spice
has given the tribe</i>

57
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,176
<i>their characteristic
blue eyes,</i>

58
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:19,220
<i>the Eyes of Ibad.</i>

59
00:06:19,303 --> 00:06:22,306
<i>Little else is known
of the Fremen,</i>

60
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,435
<i>except that they are
dangerous and unreliable.</i>

61
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,230
<i>Fremen attacks
make spice harvesting</i>

62
00:06:29,313 --> 00:06:31,190
<i>extremely hazardous.</i>

63
00:06:31,273 --> 00:06:34,944
<i>For the Fremen, spice
is the sacred hallucinogen</i>

64
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,362
<i>which preserves life</i>

65
00:06:36,445 --> 00:06:39,240
<i>and brings
enormous health benefits.</i>

66
00:06:39,323 --> 00:06:40,950
<i>For the Imperium,</i>

67
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,160
<i>spice is used
by the navigators</i>

68
00:06:43,244 --> 00:06:44,954
<i>of the Spacing Guild</i>

69
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,915
<i>to find safe paths
between the stars.</i>

70
00:06:47,998 --> 00:06:49,208
<i>Without spice,</i>

71
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:52,294
<i>interstellar travel
is impossible,</i>

72
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,838
<i>making it by far</i>

73
00:06:53,921 --> 00:06:57,133
<i>the most valuable substance
in the universe.</i>

74
00:07:46,557 --> 00:07:47,600
Smile, Gurney.

75
00:07:48,726 --> 00:07:50,769
I am smiling.

76
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:53,355
How much will it cost them,

77
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,941
traveling all this way
for this formality?

78
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:57,359
Three Guild Navigators.

79
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:01,113
A total of 1.46 million,
62 solaris, round trip.

80
00:08:16,837 --> 00:08:20,090
By the grace of
Shaddam IV of House Corrino,

81
00:08:20,174 --> 00:08:22,134
ascendant to
the Golden Lion Throne

82
00:08:22,218 --> 00:08:25,054
of Padishah Emperor
of the Known Universe,

83
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:29,391
I stand before you
as Herald of the Change.

84
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:32,394
We are witnessed by members
of the Imperial Court,

85
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,980
representatives
of the Spacing Guild

86
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:38,359
and a sister
of the Bene Gesserit.

87
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,112
The Emperor has spoken.

88
00:08:43,572 --> 00:08:46,367
"House Atreides
shall immediately

89
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,202
take control of Arrakis

90
00:08:48,285 --> 00:08:51,455
and serve as its steward."

91
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,084
Do you accept?

92
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,137
We are House Atreides.

93
00:09:07,221 --> 00:09:09,139
There is no call
we do not answer,

94
00:09:09,223 --> 00:09:11,559
there is no faith
that we betray.

95
00:09:11,642 --> 00:09:16,647
The Emperor asks us
to bring peace to Arrakis.

96
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,149
House Atreides accepts.

97
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:23,612
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

98
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:28,158
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

99
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,792
Your seal.

100
00:10:12,536 --> 00:10:13,829
So, it's done?

101
00:10:15,456 --> 00:10:16,915
It's done.

102
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:44,985
How was it?

103
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:46,487
<i>Stabilizers are too loose.</i>

104
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,656
- We'll dial it in.
- <i>Thank you, my friend.</i>

105
00:10:48,739 --> 00:10:49,823
Got it.

106
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:51,533
Duncan.

107
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:52,701
<i>My boy.</i>

108
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,203
Hey. Hey.

109
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,829
<i>Paul, my boy.</i>

110
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:00,000
So, you're going
to Arrakis tomorrow.

111
00:11:00,084 --> 00:11:01,543
With the advance team.

112
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:03,087
Yes, I'm going
to Arrakis tomorrow

113
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,421
with the advance team.

114
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:07,383
I'd like you
to take me with you.

115
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:09,009
You would?

116
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:11,929
Well, that's too bad.
'Cause no.

117
00:11:13,222 --> 00:11:14,431
Duncan.

118
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:16,767
Are you trying
to get me court-martialed?

119
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:18,936
What's going on?

120
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:20,437
Can I trust you
with something?

121
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:21,772
Always. You know that.

122
00:11:28,404 --> 00:11:30,155
I've been having dreams.

123
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,244
About Arrakis and the Fremen.

124
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,254
Okay.

125
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:46,547
So?

126
00:11:48,006 --> 00:11:49,174
I saw you.

127
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,596
<i>With the Fremen.</i>

128
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,432
Ah.

129
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:57,933
So, I do find them.

130
00:11:58,016 --> 00:12:00,352
There you go. That's a good
omen right there, right?

131
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:03,939
Lanville!

132
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,239
I saw you lying dead.

133
00:12:13,157 --> 00:12:14,950
Fallen in battle.

134
00:12:16,243 --> 00:12:18,579
<i>It felt like
if I had been there,</i>

135
00:12:18,662 --> 00:12:20,456
<i>you'd be alive.</i>

136
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:26,920
First off, I'm not gonna die.

137
00:12:27,004 --> 00:12:28,172
You're not
taking me seriously.

138
00:12:28,255 --> 00:12:30,299
That's why
you want to come with me.

139
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,717
Listen.

140
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,469
Dreams make good stories,

141
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,971
but everything important
happens when we're awake.

142
00:12:36,054 --> 00:12:38,140
'Cause that's when
we make things happen.

143
00:12:38,223 --> 00:12:40,559
Look at you.
Put on some muscle?

144
00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:41,852
I did?

145
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:43,187
No.

146
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:47,357
Hey.

147
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:49,610
See you on Arrakis, my boy.

148
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,022
Father, I'd like to ask
to join Duncan Idaho

149
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:29,858
on his scout mission
to Arrakis tomorrow.

150
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,860
I've studied the Fremen
language, I'd be an asset.

151
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,195
Out of the question.

152
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:34,571
You'll travel
in a few weeks to Arrakis,

153
00:13:34,655 --> 00:13:35,781
like the rest of us.

154
00:13:35,864 --> 00:13:37,157
I've been training
my whole life.

155
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:38,492
What is the point

156
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:39,868
if I'm not allowed
to face some actual risk?

157
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,203
You know why, Paul.

158
00:13:41,286 --> 00:13:43,372
You're the future
of House Atreides.

159
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,874
And Grandfather
fought bulls for sport!

160
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,668
Yes.

161
00:13:47,751 --> 00:13:49,378
And look where that got him.

162
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:56,051
I need you by my side.

163
00:13:56,134 --> 00:13:59,179
When we get to Arrakis,
we'll face enormous danger.

164
00:13:59,263 --> 00:14:00,806
What danger?

165
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:02,766
The Fremen? The desert?

166
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,810
Political danger.

167
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,940
The Great Houses
look to us for leadership,

168
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:12,067
and this threatens
the Emperor.

169
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,404
By taking Arrakis from the
Harkonnens and making it ours,

170
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,573
he sets the stage for a war

171
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,783
which would weaken
both houses.

172
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:23,078
But if we hold firm,

173
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:25,247
and tap the true power
of Arrakis,

174
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,624
we could be stronger
than ever.

175
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,334
What does that mean?

176
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:30,544
Mining spice,

177
00:14:30,627 --> 00:14:32,129
keeping the Fremen
in their place?

178
00:14:32,212 --> 00:14:33,422
We'd be no better
than Harkonnens.

179
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,923
No.

180
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,135
By making an alliance
with the Fremen.

181
00:14:38,218 --> 00:14:40,929
That's what I've sent
Duncan Idaho to arrange.

182
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:43,515
Here on Caladan,

183
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:46,101
we've ruled by air power
and sea power.

184
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:50,022
On Arrakis, we need
to cultivate desert power.

185
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:55,068
I want you sitting in
on my Council.

186
00:14:55,152 --> 00:14:56,528
Learn what I do.

187
00:14:56,612 --> 00:14:58,363
What if I'm not, Dad?

188
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,408
Not what?

189
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:05,454
The future of House Atreides.

190
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,260
I told my father
I didn't want this either.

191
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,058
I wanted to be a pilot.

192
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:28,685
You never told me that.

193
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,815
Your grandfather said,

194
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,652
"A great man
doesn't seek to lead.

195
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:40,364
He's called to it,
and he answers."

196
00:15:42,032 --> 00:15:43,951
And if your answer is no...

197
00:15:47,037 --> 00:15:50,248
you'll still be the only thing
I ever needed you to be...

198
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,335
my son.

199
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,432
I found my own way to it.
Maybe you'll find yours.

200
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,771
In their memory...

201
00:16:15,315 --> 00:16:17,109
give it a try.

202
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:28,120
Don't stand
with your back to the door.

203
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:30,872
How many times
do we have to tell you?

204
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,374
I could tell it was you

205
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:34,209
by your footsteps,
Gurney Halleck.

206
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:37,045
Someone
might imitate my stride.

207
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,380
I know the difference.

208
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:40,048
Are you the new
Weapons Master?

209
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,885
With Duncan Idaho gone,
I must make do as best I can.

210
00:16:45,012 --> 00:16:46,388
Choose your blade.

211
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:48,223
I've had quite a day, Gurney.

212
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:50,350
Give us a song instead.

213
00:16:54,938 --> 00:16:56,023
That's rude.

214
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,083
Come on.

215
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,168
Come on.

216
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:17,461
Old man.

217
00:17:29,139 --> 00:17:31,683
Ah, the slow blade
penetrates the shield.

218
00:17:38,774 --> 00:17:40,609
I guess I'm not
in the mood today.

219
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:41,902
- Mood?
- Yeah.

220
00:17:41,985 --> 00:17:43,111
What's mood to do with it?

221
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,946
You fight
when the necessity arises,

222
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,031
no matter the mood.

223
00:17:46,114 --> 00:17:47,199
Now fight!

224
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:53,705
Come on!

225
00:18:05,383 --> 00:18:07,761
I have you.

226
00:18:07,844 --> 00:18:09,554
Aye.

227
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:11,306
But look down, my lord.

228
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:13,975
You'd have joined me in death.

229
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,936
I see you found the mood.

230
00:18:28,156 --> 00:18:29,741
Will it be that bad?

231
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:32,327
You don't get it, do you?

232
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,662
You don't really understand

233
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:36,415
the grave nature
of what's happening to us.

234
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:40,335
For 80 years,

235
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:42,546
Arrakis belonged
to House Harkonnen.

236
00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:45,132
80 years of owning
the spice fields.

237
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:47,342
Can you imagine the wealth?

238
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:49,344
Your eyes.
I need to see it in your eyes.

239
00:18:49,427 --> 00:18:51,930
You never met
Harkonnens before, I have.

240
00:18:52,013 --> 00:18:55,058
They're not human,
they're brutal!

241
00:18:55,142 --> 00:18:57,060
You have to be ready.

242
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,187
Lord Baron.

243
00:19:42,189 --> 00:19:44,399
Rabban.

244
00:19:44,482 --> 00:19:47,152
The last of our ships
have left Arrakis.

245
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:49,529
It's done.

246
00:19:49,613 --> 00:19:51,114
Very good.

247
00:19:54,117 --> 00:19:56,203
Uncle, how can we
let this happen?

248
00:19:56,286 --> 00:19:58,330
How can the Emperor

249
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:00,957
take everything we've built

250
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,335
and give it to that Duke?

251
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:04,711
How?

252
00:20:04,794 --> 00:20:07,714
Don't be too sure
it's an act of love.

253
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:11,593
What does he mean?

254
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:20,018
When is a gift not a gift?

255
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:25,315
The Atreides' voice is rising,

256
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:28,693
and the Emperor
is a jealous man.

257
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:33,949
A dangerous, jealous man.

258
00:21:45,603 --> 00:21:46,646
Paul.

259
00:21:48,148 --> 00:21:49,858
Paul, wake up.

260
00:21:55,655 --> 00:21:56,698
What's wrong?

261
00:21:56,781 --> 00:21:59,075
Get dressed and come with me.

262
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:20,889
What is this?

263
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:23,892
The Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam is here.

264
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:26,102
She was my teacher
at the Bene Gesserit school.

265
00:22:26,186 --> 00:22:29,731
She's now Truthsayer
to the Emperor himself.

266
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:31,691
She would like to meet you.

267
00:22:32,275 --> 00:22:33,902
Why?

268
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:36,321
She wants to know
about your dreams.

269
00:22:37,697 --> 00:22:39,532
How does she know
about my dreams?

270
00:22:42,202 --> 00:22:43,745
And why is Dr. Yueh here?

271
00:22:43,828 --> 00:22:46,206
He only needs a moment.

272
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:48,291
Hello, young master.

273
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:51,086
Your mother asked me
to check your vitals.

274
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,385
What's happening?

275
00:23:19,864 --> 00:23:22,742
His heart
is strong as ever, my lady.

276
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,966
Paul...

277
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:11,583
<i>Who are you?</i>

278
00:24:15,962 --> 00:24:18,214
Defiance in the eyes.

279
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:19,966
Like his father.

280
00:24:20,049 --> 00:24:21,634
Leave us.

281
00:24:21,718 --> 00:24:22,719
You must do everything

282
00:24:22,802 --> 00:24:24,179
the Reverend Mother tells you.

283
00:24:27,807 --> 00:24:29,142
You dismiss my mother
in her own house.

284
00:24:29,225 --> 00:24:30,393
Come here.

285
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,061
Kneel.

286
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:38,109
How dare you use
the Voice on me?

287
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,743
Put
your right hand in the box.

288
00:24:48,912 --> 00:24:51,331
Your mother bade you obey me.

289
00:24:59,422 --> 00:25:01,883
I hold at your neck
the Gom Jabbar.

290
00:25:02,926 --> 00:25:04,594
A poison needle.

291
00:25:04,677 --> 00:25:05,970
Instant death.

292
00:25:07,013 --> 00:25:08,556
The test is simple.

293
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,184
Remove your hand from the box

294
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:12,852
and you die.

295
00:25:13,811 --> 00:25:15,563
What's in the box?

296
00:25:16,814 --> 00:25:17,899
Pain.

297
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:22,695
No need to call the guards.

298
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:24,405
<i>Your mother stands
behind that door.</i>

299
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,199
<i>No one would get past her.</i>

300
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,666
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

301
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:37,752
An animal caught in a trap

302
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:40,630
will gnaw off
its own leg to escape.

303
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,632
What will you do?

304
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,666
Silence.

305
00:26:25,508 --> 00:26:27,343
I must not fear.

306
00:26:29,095 --> 00:26:30,680
I must not fear.

307
00:26:37,103 --> 00:26:38,980
Fear is the mind-killer.

308
00:26:41,065 --> 00:26:42,317
<i>Fear</i>

309
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,777
is the little death
that brings obliteration.

310
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,324
And I'll face my fear
and I'll permit it

311
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:50,533
to pass over me
and through me.

312
00:27:05,923 --> 00:27:07,258
And when it has gone past...

313
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:18,811
I will turn the inner eye
and see its path.

314
00:27:21,856 --> 00:27:24,567
{\an8}And where the fear
has gone,

315
00:27:25,401 --> 00:27:26,444
{\an8}there will be nothing.

316
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:32,950
Only I will remain.

317
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,498
Enough.

318
00:27:55,098 --> 00:27:57,725
Like sifting sand
through a screen,

319
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,395
we sift people.

320
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:03,356
If you had been unable
to control your impulses,

321
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:05,024
like an animal,

322
00:28:05,108 --> 00:28:07,318
we could not let you live.

323
00:28:07,402 --> 00:28:10,071
You inherit too much power.

324
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:11,280
What, because
I'm a duke's son?

325
00:28:11,364 --> 00:28:14,158
Because you are Jessica's son.

326
00:28:14,242 --> 00:28:16,869
You have more
than one birthright, boy.

327
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:19,539
Jessica?

328
00:28:26,587 --> 00:28:28,923
You've been training him
in the Way.

329
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:36,013
Tell me about these dreams.

330
00:28:36,097 --> 00:28:38,224
- I had one tonight.
- What did you see?

331
00:28:41,144 --> 00:28:42,520
A girl.

332
00:28:42,603 --> 00:28:44,272
On Arrakis.

333
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:45,732
Have you dreamt of her before?

334
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,154
Many times.

335
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,908
Do you often dream
things that happen

336
00:28:55,992 --> 00:28:57,160
just as you dreamed them?

337
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,873
Not exactly.

338
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:07,128
Goodbye, young human.

339
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,547
I hope you live.

340
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:19,474
Did you have to go that far?

341
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,309
You chose
to train him in the Way,

342
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,311
in defiance of our rule.

343
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:24,937
He wields our power.

344
00:29:25,021 --> 00:29:27,815
He had to be
tested to the limits.

345
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:31,152
So much potential,
wasted in a male.

346
00:29:31,235 --> 00:29:33,196
You were told
to bear only daughters.

347
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,655
But you, in your pride,

348
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:36,657
thought you could
produce the <i>Kwisatz Haderach.</i>

349
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,159
Was I wrong?

350
00:29:38,242 --> 00:29:40,995
You're lucky he didn't die
in that room.

351
00:29:41,078 --> 00:29:43,331
If he is The One,
he has a long way to go.

352
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:46,459
His Sight is barely awakened,
and now he goes into the fire.

353
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,379
But our plans
are measured in centuries.

354
00:29:50,463 --> 00:29:52,006
We have other prospects

355
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:54,467
if he fails his promise.

356
00:29:57,053 --> 00:29:59,555
Do you see so little hope?

357
00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:01,015
On Arrakis,
we have done

358
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:02,725
all we can for you.

359
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:04,644
A path has been laid.

360
00:30:04,727 --> 00:30:06,979
Let's hope
he doesn't squander it.

361
00:30:54,235 --> 00:30:55,570
Paul.

362
00:30:56,445 --> 00:30:58,030
What does it mean?

363
00:30:59,407 --> 00:31:01,075
That I could be The One?

364
00:31:01,158 --> 00:31:02,493
You heard.

365
00:31:05,872 --> 00:31:07,123
The Bene Gesserit serve

366
00:31:07,206 --> 00:31:09,709
as powerful partners
to the Great Houses,

367
00:31:10,751 --> 00:31:12,003
but there's more to it.

368
00:31:12,086 --> 00:31:14,630
You steer the politics
of the Imperium

369
00:31:14,714 --> 00:31:16,132
from the shadows.

370
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:17,842
I know.

371
00:31:17,925 --> 00:31:20,386
You don't know everything.

372
00:31:20,469 --> 00:31:22,763
For thousands of years,

373
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:25,474
we've been carefully
crossings bloodlines

374
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:27,685
- to bring forth...
- The One?

375
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,313
A mind...

376
00:31:32,064 --> 00:31:36,402
powerful enough
to bridge space and time.

377
00:31:37,194 --> 00:31:39,030
Past and future.

378
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,326
Who can help us
into a better future.

379
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:47,204
We think he's very close now.

380
00:31:49,165 --> 00:31:51,334
Some believe he's here.

381
00:31:55,338 --> 00:31:57,340
All part of a plan.

382
00:34:15,478 --> 00:34:16,479
Shield.

383
00:34:58,938 --> 00:35:00,815
"My lungs taste
the air of Time,

384
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:02,900
Blown past falling sand..."

385
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:48,696
Thufir Hawat.

386
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,660
Young master!

387
00:35:54,743 --> 00:35:57,037
How does it feel
to walk on a new world?

388
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,039
Exciting, to say the least.

389
00:35:59,748 --> 00:36:01,584
My lord.

390
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:03,294
How are you, old friend?

391
00:36:03,377 --> 00:36:05,713
My advance team
has secured the city.

392
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:08,799
We're still smoothing out
a few rough spots.

393
00:36:10,426 --> 00:36:11,760
My lady.

394
00:36:16,223 --> 00:36:18,184
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

395
00:36:33,949 --> 00:36:36,952
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!
Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

396
00:36:38,037 --> 00:36:40,039
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

397
00:36:40,122 --> 00:36:42,374
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

398
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:45,419
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

399
00:36:45,502 --> 00:36:48,422
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

400
00:36:48,505 --> 00:36:51,508
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

401
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:54,970
Don't be fooled
by the welcome.

402
00:36:55,054 --> 00:36:56,931
They follow
their old masters' rules.

403
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,140
Mandatory attendance.

404
00:36:58,224 --> 00:37:00,517
That's Harkonnen love
out there.

405
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:08,609
Atreides!

406
00:37:08,692 --> 00:37:12,279
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

407
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:16,116
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

408
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,661
Atreides! Atreides!

409
00:37:20,788 --> 00:37:23,540
Let's get you
out of the sun.

410
00:37:23,624 --> 00:37:26,126
The heat can kill
in this place.

411
00:37:42,351 --> 00:37:44,103
They were pointing at us.

412
00:37:45,104 --> 00:37:46,438
What are they shouting?

413
00:37:46,522 --> 00:37:50,442
<i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>
"Voice from the Outer World."

414
00:37:50,526 --> 00:37:53,237
It's their name for "messiah."

415
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,615
It means the Bene Gesserit
have been at work here.

416
00:37:56,699 --> 00:37:59,159
Planting superstitions.

417
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:02,037
Preparing the way, Paul.

418
00:38:02,121 --> 00:38:04,456
These people
have waited for centuries

419
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,292
for the <i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>

420
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:08,085
They see you,

421
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,838
they see the signs.

422
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,884
They see
what they've been told to see.

423
00:38:20,973 --> 00:38:22,016
We're good to go.

424
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:06,852
Shield Wall.

425
00:39:06,935 --> 00:39:08,812
Protects the city
from the weather

426
00:39:08,896 --> 00:39:10,397
and the worms.

427
00:39:57,236 --> 00:40:00,072
The locals call
the big one the Hand of God.

428
00:40:01,865 --> 00:40:04,451
Well, the Hand of God
is wreaking havoc

429
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:06,078
on our comms system.

430
00:40:09,289 --> 00:40:10,749
It's so quiet.

431
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:13,836
Yeah.

432
00:40:13,919 --> 00:40:15,796
That's what worries me, too.

433
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,304
There's the spaceport

434
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:27,015
and that plume of dust there
is the spice refinery.

435
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:29,184
Our two
most vulnerable points.

436
00:40:29,268 --> 00:40:30,561
I want you guarding them.

437
00:40:30,644 --> 00:40:33,272
If we can't refine spice
and ship it off-world,

438
00:40:33,355 --> 00:40:35,399
- we're dead here.
- My lord.

439
00:40:35,482 --> 00:40:38,110
The sun's getting too high.
We need to seal the doors.

440
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,992
What do they say
about this hellhole again?

441
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,536
"To shower, you scrub your ass
with sand," my lord.

442
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:49,163
That's what they say.

443
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:50,873
That's what they say.

444
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:58,130
Candidates
for a housekeeper, my lady.

445
00:41:13,896 --> 00:41:15,397
What is your name?

446
00:41:15,481 --> 00:41:17,649
Shadout Mapes, my lady.

447
00:41:19,401 --> 00:41:21,487
The rest of you may go.

448
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:22,696
Thank you.

449
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,950
Shadout.

450
00:41:27,034 --> 00:41:28,827
It's an old Chakobsa word.

451
00:41:29,578 --> 00:41:31,038
"Well-dipper."

452
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:35,209
{\an8}You know the ancient tongues?

453
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,752
I know many things.

454
00:41:36,835 --> 00:41:40,005
I know that you have a weapon
concealed in your bodice.

455
00:41:42,216 --> 00:41:43,759
{\an8}If you mean to harm me,

456
00:41:43,842 --> 00:41:46,345
I must warn you,
whatever you're hiding,

457
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:48,931
it won't be enough.

458
00:41:50,682 --> 00:41:53,185
The weapon is meant as a gift

459
00:41:54,102 --> 00:41:56,313
if you are truly The One.

460
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,747
Do you know this?

461
00:42:15,082 --> 00:42:16,708
It's a crysknife.

462
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:21,922
Do you know its meaning?

463
00:42:26,134 --> 00:42:27,761
It's a maker...

464
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:35,310
A maker of the deep desert.

465
00:42:37,854 --> 00:42:40,274
When you have lived
with prophecy for so long,

466
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:42,943
the moment of revelation
is a shock.

467
00:42:43,026 --> 00:42:44,695
<i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>

468
00:42:44,778 --> 00:42:46,905
The mother and the son.

469
00:42:52,828 --> 00:42:54,580
It is yours.

470
00:42:56,164 --> 00:42:59,793
Tooth of <i>Shai-Hulud.</i>

471
00:43:29,906 --> 00:43:32,701
<i>Lisan! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

472
00:43:32,784 --> 00:43:36,914
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

473
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:48,467
Hello.

474
00:43:50,844 --> 00:43:53,555
You shouldn't be out here
at this hour of the day.

475
00:43:55,724 --> 00:43:57,976
They're out here.

476
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,687
Hmm.
Fremen pilgrims.

477
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:02,731
They don't care
about heatstroke.

478
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:07,694
I didn't know date palms
could even be found out here.

479
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:10,906
Oh,
these aren't indigenous.

480
00:44:10,989 --> 00:44:13,450
They can't survive without me.

481
00:44:13,533 --> 00:44:14,743
Each one of these

482
00:44:14,826 --> 00:44:17,412
drinks every day
the equivalent of five men.

483
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:21,208
Twenty palm trees.

484
00:44:22,501 --> 00:44:25,045
A hundred lives.

485
00:44:25,128 --> 00:44:27,172
Should we remove them?
Save the water?

486
00:44:27,255 --> 00:44:28,674
No, no, no.

487
00:44:28,757 --> 00:44:30,342
These are sacred.

488
00:44:34,721 --> 00:44:36,181
Old dream.

489
00:44:44,064 --> 00:44:46,233
<i>The largest and most dangerous</i>

490
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:49,277
<i>organism on Arrakis

<i>which attract the sandworms,</i>

494
00:44:57,619 --> 00:45:01,581
<i>the Fremen cross desert spaces
using the sandwalk,</i>

495
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:04,668
<i>a dance-like motion
with irregular rhythm</i>

496
00:45:04,751 --> 00:45:08,755
<i>which emulates the natural
sounds of the desert.</i>

497
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:11,466
<i>What scant plant life
exists on Arrakis</i>

498
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,135
<i>is thanks to the Fremen,</i>

499
00:45:13,218 --> 00:45:16,138
<i>who have cultivated
deep-rooted terranic plants</i>

500
00:45:16,221 --> 00:45:19,266
<i>such as saguaro, burrobush,</i>

501
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:23,437
<i>sand-verbena and incense bush.</i>

502
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,773
<i>The shepherd's tree has
the deepest documented roots,</i>

503
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:31,361
<i>stretching more than
450 feet deep.</i>

504
00:45:31,445 --> 00:45:33,321
<i>These plants cling to life</i>

505
00:45:33,405 --> 00:45:36,700
<i>in a parched,
nutrient-poor landscape.</i>

506
00:46:46,853 --> 00:46:48,563
It's a hunter-seeker.

507
00:46:48,647 --> 00:46:50,690
The operator must be nearby.

508
00:46:55,737 --> 00:46:57,197
<i>The Harkonnen agent
was cemented</i>

509
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,157
<i>into that hole six weeks ago.</i>

510
00:46:59,241 --> 00:47:00,951
<i>Ran the hunter-seeker
through a water pipe</i>

511
00:47:01,034 --> 00:47:02,118
<i>inside the walls.</i>

512
00:47:03,411 --> 00:47:06,498
Sire, I failed you today.
There's no excuse.

513
00:47:06,581 --> 00:47:07,999
You have my resignation.

514
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:09,376
You would deprive us
of your talents at this time?

515
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:10,669
Sire, my honor demands...

516
00:47:10,752 --> 00:47:12,462
They tried to take
the life of my son!

517
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,090
I don't give a damn
about your honor.

518
00:47:15,173 --> 00:47:17,759
You want absolution?
Go catch some spies.

519
00:47:17,843 --> 00:47:19,052
Your Grace.

520
00:47:26,351 --> 00:47:28,603
The thing must leave.

521
00:47:28,687 --> 00:47:31,189
You can speak
without fear.

522
00:47:31,273 --> 00:47:33,567
Our pet doesn't understand
your language.

523
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,110
Get out.

524
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:41,283
It understands.

525
00:47:41,366 --> 00:47:42,909
Activate silence.

526
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,802
It must
never be known.

527
00:48:00,886 --> 00:48:03,805
There's
no satellites over Arrakis.

528
00:48:03,889 --> 00:48:07,517
The Atreides
will die in the dark.

529
00:48:07,601 --> 00:48:09,269
On that matter,

530
00:48:09,352 --> 00:48:12,522
Duke Leto Atreides
means nothing to our order.

531
00:48:12,606 --> 00:48:14,566
But his wife
is under our protection

532
00:48:14,649 --> 00:48:17,277
and by extension, her son.

533
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,863
Allow them
the dignity of exile.

534
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:25,952
House Harkonnen
would never dream

535
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:28,997
of violating
the sanctity of your order.

536
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,708
I give you my word.

537
00:48:31,791 --> 00:48:33,460
We will not harm them.

538
00:48:53,688 --> 00:48:55,231
If the Duke's son lives...

539
00:48:55,315 --> 00:48:57,817
No Atreides will live.

540
00:48:57,901 --> 00:49:00,320
My lord, you gave your word
to the witch.

541
00:49:00,403 --> 00:49:01,488
She sees too much.

542
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:03,323
I said I would not harm them.

543
00:49:03,406 --> 00:49:04,658
And I shall not.

544
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:07,035
But Arrakis is Arrakis.

545
00:49:08,244 --> 00:49:10,830
And the desert takes the weak.

546
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:14,167
My desert.

547
00:49:17,003 --> 00:49:18,964
My Arrakis.

548
00:49:20,882 --> 00:49:22,550
My Dune.

549
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:28,098
Your first
strategy meeting.

550
00:49:28,181 --> 00:49:29,391
Paul Atreides,

551
00:49:29,474 --> 00:49:31,393
who catches hunter-seekers
in his bare hands

552
00:49:31,476 --> 00:49:32,602
like a hero of old.

553
00:49:35,021 --> 00:49:37,190
Thanks
for the humiliation, old man.

554
00:49:37,273 --> 00:49:38,566
Gotta keep an eye on you.

555
00:49:39,442 --> 00:49:40,735
Attention!

556
00:49:48,743 --> 00:49:50,120
Let's get started.

557
00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:54,374
Thufir. Operations.

558
00:49:54,457 --> 00:49:57,127
I secured a copy of
the Harkonnens' account books.

559
00:49:59,587 --> 00:50:00,880
The Harkonnens were taking

560
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:04,426
10 billion solaris
out of here every year.

561
00:50:04,509 --> 00:50:07,178
"They shall suck of
the abundance of the seas,

562
00:50:07,262 --> 00:50:08,763
and the treasure
hid in the sand."

563
00:50:08,847 --> 00:50:11,224
We won't see profits
like that for a while.

564
00:50:11,307 --> 00:50:13,476
Not with the equipment
they left us.

565
00:50:14,436 --> 00:50:16,062
How bad is it?

566
00:50:21,776 --> 00:50:23,778
These are spice silos.

567
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:28,241
We're meant
to fill every crate.

568
00:50:28,324 --> 00:50:30,243
All of them?

569
00:50:30,326 --> 00:50:33,163
Every 25 standard days.

570
00:50:33,246 --> 00:50:35,582
Harkonnen sabotage
slows us down.

571
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:37,375
But who's
meant to arbitrate?

572
00:50:37,459 --> 00:50:38,668
Isn't there
a Judge of the Change

573
00:50:38,752 --> 00:50:40,045
to oversee the transition?

574
00:50:40,128 --> 00:50:41,546
Who did the Emperor appoint?

575
00:50:41,629 --> 00:50:44,424
Dr. Liet Kynes.
Imperial Ecologist.

576
00:50:44,507 --> 00:50:46,009
Been here 20 years.

577
00:50:46,092 --> 00:50:47,927
Eccentric, from what I'm told.

578
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:51,056
I want to see these
harvesting fields myself.

579
00:50:51,139 --> 00:50:52,515
I wouldn't recommend it,
my lord.

580
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:55,060
Have this Judge of the Change
accompany us.

581
00:50:55,143 --> 00:50:56,603
A meeting's long overdue.

582
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,897
And we'll get
a bit of Imperial protection.

583
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:00,482
A hostage.

584
00:51:00,565 --> 00:51:01,858
I love it.

585
00:51:01,941 --> 00:51:03,026
Hmm.

586
00:51:03,109 --> 00:51:05,361
He's here, my lord.

587
00:51:29,302 --> 00:51:31,262
Take care
of them. They are friends.

588
00:51:31,346 --> 00:51:32,305
Duncan!

589
00:51:32,388 --> 00:51:33,765
Ah! My boy!

590
00:51:39,562 --> 00:51:40,730
I swear you're getting taller.

591
00:51:40,814 --> 00:51:42,482
Well,
you smell much worse.

592
00:51:46,194 --> 00:51:48,154
For four weeks,
I lived with the Fremen.

593
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:49,322
Hidden in the desert,

594
00:51:49,405 --> 00:51:51,116
in a community
called a <i>sietch.</i>

595
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:52,492
Stilgar, the leader
of that <i>sietch,</i>

596
00:51:52,575 --> 00:51:54,369
has come with me
to meet you, sire.

597
00:51:54,452 --> 00:51:56,788
This <i>sietch,</i> how is it hidden?

598
00:51:56,871 --> 00:51:57,956
It's underground.

599
00:51:58,039 --> 00:51:59,999
Arrakis is filled
with caverns.

600
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:01,751
How big was the place?

601
00:52:01,835 --> 00:52:04,295
I'd say 10,000 people.

602
00:52:04,379 --> 00:52:05,922
And there are
hundreds of <i>sietches.</i>

603
00:52:07,132 --> 00:52:08,550
Millions of Fremen.

604
00:52:09,342 --> 00:52:10,802
You were right.

605
00:52:10,885 --> 00:52:14,222
The Harkonnen estimate was
50,000 on the whole planet.

606
00:52:14,305 --> 00:52:16,516
The Fremen watched me
search for them for days.

607
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:18,059
I never saw them.

608
00:52:18,143 --> 00:52:20,854
Finally, they sent
a warrior out to kill me.

609
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:22,522
And I gotta tell you,

610
00:52:22,605 --> 00:52:25,024
I have never come
so close to dying.

611
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,902
There's no finer fighter
in the Imperium.

612
00:52:27,986 --> 00:52:29,571
They fight like demons.

613
00:52:29,654 --> 00:52:31,531
Desert power.

614
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,702
Duncan.

615
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:37,245
- Well done.
- Thank you, my lord.

616
00:52:37,328 --> 00:52:38,705
Sire.

617
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:41,374
Their leader has a knife
he won't surrender, sire.

618
00:52:41,457 --> 00:52:44,544
It's a crysknife.
It's sacred to his people.

619
00:52:44,627 --> 00:52:45,837
Let him pass.

620
00:53:02,478 --> 00:53:03,855
Stop there.

621
00:53:03,938 --> 00:53:05,607
Hey! Hey!

622
00:53:09,194 --> 00:53:10,195
Mm.

623
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:12,197
Stilgar.

624
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:14,324
Welcome.

625
00:53:15,533 --> 00:53:17,911
Sir, I respect
the personal dignity

626
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:19,787
of any man that respects mine.

627
00:53:23,082 --> 00:53:24,125
Hmm.

628
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:28,880
Hold.

629
00:53:30,131 --> 00:53:32,050
Thank you, Stilgar,

630
00:53:32,133 --> 00:53:35,553
for the gift
of your body's moisture.

631
00:53:35,637 --> 00:53:37,972
We accept it in the spirit
in which it was given.

632
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:47,065
I'm glad you've come.

633
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:49,943
I believe your people and mine

634
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:51,319
have much
to offer one another.

635
00:53:51,402 --> 00:53:52,779
No, no, you are Outworlders.

636
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:54,530
You come here for the spice,

637
00:53:54,614 --> 00:53:57,075
you take it,
giving nothing in return.

638
00:53:58,826 --> 00:53:59,869
That's true.

639
00:54:01,788 --> 00:54:04,707
I know you've suffered
at the hands of the Harkonnen.

640
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,335
Name what you want.

641
00:54:07,418 --> 00:54:08,628
If it's in my power to grant,

642
00:54:08,711 --> 00:54:10,171
I'll give it
and ask for nothing.

643
00:54:10,255 --> 00:54:13,132
Mm. I ask for this.
Do not seek our <i>sietches.</i>

644
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:16,052
Do not trespass in our lands.

645
00:54:16,135 --> 00:54:19,597
The desert was ours
long before you came.

646
00:54:19,681 --> 00:54:21,474
So, come and dig your spice,

647
00:54:21,557 --> 00:54:22,767
but when you have it,

648
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:24,978
go back to this side
of the Shield Wall

649
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:26,854
and leave the desert
to the Fremen.

650
00:54:26,938 --> 00:54:29,732
You will address the Duke
as "my lord" or "sire."

651
00:54:29,816 --> 00:54:32,402
Gurney, just...
Just a moment.

652
00:54:32,485 --> 00:54:33,820
The Emperor

653
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:36,656
has given me Arrakis
as my fief

654
00:54:36,739 --> 00:54:38,491
to rule and protect.

655
00:54:38,574 --> 00:54:41,077
I cannot promise
not to travel into the desert

656
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,997
if duty compels me.

657
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,000
But your <i>sietches</i>
will be yours forever.

658
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,669
And you will never be hunted
while I govern here.

659
00:54:54,173 --> 00:54:56,009
That's very honorable.

660
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:58,761
I must go. That's all
I have to say to you.

661
00:54:58,845 --> 00:55:01,014
Won't you stay?

662
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:02,473
We would honor you.

663
00:55:02,557 --> 00:55:05,643
Honor requires
that I be elsewhere.

664
00:55:17,322 --> 00:55:18,573
I don't like him.

665
00:55:18,656 --> 00:55:20,908
Our plan bears fruit.

666
00:55:20,992 --> 00:55:22,410
But it will take time?

667
00:55:22,493 --> 00:55:23,745
Yes.

668
00:55:24,704 --> 00:55:26,998
It will take time.

669
00:55:29,751 --> 00:55:31,127
Here, this is for you.

670
00:55:35,214 --> 00:55:37,216
It's a paracompass.

671
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,802
The moons here
have a magnetic field, so...

672
00:55:39,886 --> 00:55:42,513
a simple compass needle
won't point north.

673
00:55:42,597 --> 00:55:44,724
Takes a clever piece
of clockwork to sort it out.

674
00:55:44,807 --> 00:55:46,476
The Fremen make these?

675
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,394
And stillsuits,
and sand compactors,

676
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:49,896
and all kinds
of ingenious things.

677
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:51,939
What the hell
is a sand compactor?

678
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:55,234
That's a sand compactor.

679
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:59,238
My God, man,
you've gone native.

680
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:00,615
You admire them.

681
00:56:01,908 --> 00:56:03,409
I do.

682
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:06,162
They're fierce but loyal.

683
00:56:06,245 --> 00:56:08,039
They're attuned to the desert.

684
00:56:08,122 --> 00:56:09,374
Part of it.

685
00:56:09,457 --> 00:56:11,584
It's part of them.

686
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:12,835
You wait till you see it.

687
00:56:13,669 --> 00:56:15,088
It's beautiful out there.

688
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:20,385
<i>Sunrise warning, all workers.</i>

689
00:56:20,468 --> 00:56:23,429
<i>Temperature today
will reach 140 degrees.</i>

690
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:25,264
<i>We are currently 90 degrees,</i>

691
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:28,726
<i>and in 10 minutes,
we will hit 120 degrees.</i>

692
00:56:29,811 --> 00:56:31,104
<i>Last warning call.</i>

693
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:06,556
The Judge of the Change, sire.

694
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:08,599
Dr. Liet Kynes.

695
00:57:08,683 --> 00:57:10,101
My lord Duke.

696
00:57:10,893 --> 00:57:12,478
Welcome to Arrakis.

697
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:14,647
You're
the Imperial Ecologist.

698
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:16,649
Thank you for the stillsuits.

699
00:57:16,732 --> 00:57:18,818
They are of Fremen make.

700
00:57:18,901 --> 00:57:19,986
The best.

701
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:21,362
With your permission, sire,

702
00:57:21,446 --> 00:57:22,822
I must check
the integrity of your suit...

703
00:57:22,905 --> 00:57:24,031
Whoa.

704
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:25,950
It's all right.

705
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:29,787
It's all right.

706
00:57:29,871 --> 00:57:33,458
Dr. Kynes,
we're in your hands.

707
00:57:38,004 --> 00:57:39,172
A stillsuit

708
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:43,217
is a high-efficiency
filtration system.

709
00:57:43,301 --> 00:57:44,886
Even this early
in the morning,

710
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:47,763
you wouldn't survive two hours
without one of these.

711
00:57:48,681 --> 00:57:50,933
It cools the body

712
00:57:51,017 --> 00:57:54,854
and recycles
the water lost to sweat.

713
00:57:54,937 --> 00:57:58,232
Your body's movements
provide the power.

714
00:57:58,316 --> 00:58:00,026
Inside the mask,
you'll find a tube

715
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:02,195
to allow you to drink
the recycled water.

716
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:03,529
Mm.

717
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:04,947
In good working order,
your suit won't lose

718
00:58:05,031 --> 00:58:07,325
more than a thimbleful
of water a day.

719
00:58:07,408 --> 00:58:08,743
Most impressive.

720
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:11,787
Let's have a look at you, lad.

721
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:15,541
You've...

722
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:16,834
worn a stillsuit before?

723
00:58:16,918 --> 00:58:18,544
No, this is my first time.

724
00:58:20,755 --> 00:58:23,382
Your desert boots are fitted
slip-fashion at the ankles.

725
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:25,301
Who taught you to do that?

726
00:58:25,384 --> 00:58:27,428
It seemed the right way.

727
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:36,229
Are you Fremen?

728
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:41,901
I am accepted
in both <i>sietch</i> and village.

729
00:58:41,984 --> 00:58:44,654
Now, come and see
the spice sands

730
00:58:44,737 --> 00:58:47,782
on which
your livelihood depends.

731
00:59:25,736 --> 00:59:26,946
What would you do

732
00:59:27,029 --> 00:59:28,573
if your ornithopter
went down out here?

733
00:59:28,656 --> 00:59:30,783
You wouldn't want
to go down out there.

734
00:59:30,866 --> 00:59:32,451
It's worm territory.

735
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:36,163
Dust cloud.

736
00:59:37,248 --> 00:59:39,458
I see it.

737
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:41,669
That's one of your harvesters.

738
01:00:07,612 --> 01:00:08,779
You can see the spice

739
01:00:08,863 --> 01:00:10,740
scattered over the surface.

740
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:14,243
A rich spice bed

741
01:00:14,327 --> 01:00:15,786
by the color.

742
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:18,372
If you get a little higher,
you'll have a better view.

743
01:00:33,095 --> 01:00:35,723
You see these spotter aircraft
looking for wormsign.

744
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:38,976
Wormsign?

745
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:41,354
A sand wave
moving toward the crawler.

746
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:43,648
Worms travel deep
but get closer

747
01:00:43,731 --> 01:00:45,107
to the surface
when they attack.

748
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,401
If you are patient,

749
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:50,363
we should see one.

750
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:51,906
A worm always comes?

751
01:00:51,989 --> 01:00:54,784
Always. They're drawn
by rhythmic noises.

752
01:00:54,867 --> 01:00:56,952
Why don't we just shield
the crawlers?

753
01:00:57,036 --> 01:00:59,538
A shield's a death sentence
in the desert.

754
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:00,873
It attracts the worms

755
01:01:00,956 --> 01:01:03,626
and drives them
into a killing frenzy.

756
01:01:06,379 --> 01:01:07,421
Is that a worm?

757
01:01:19,642 --> 01:01:21,435
Big one.

758
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:23,854
You have good eyes.

759
01:01:23,938 --> 01:01:26,190
Calling crawler
Delta Ajax niner.

760
01:01:26,273 --> 01:01:28,776
Wormsign warning. Acknowledge.

761
01:01:28,859 --> 01:01:31,570
<i>Who calls Delta Ajax niner?</i>

762
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:32,697
<i>Over.</i>

763
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:34,198
They seem pretty calm
about it.

764
01:01:34,281 --> 01:01:36,784
Unlisted flight.
Imperium business.

765
01:01:36,867 --> 01:01:39,036
Wormsign north
and east of you.

766
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,122
3.7 kilometers.

767
01:01:41,205 --> 01:01:42,748
<i>Delta Ajax niner,</i>

768
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:44,625
<i>this is Spotter One.
Wormsign confirmed.</i>

769
01:01:46,001 --> 01:01:48,295
<i>Stand by for contact fix.</i>

770
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:54,427
<i>Worm is on intercept course
to your position.</i>

771
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,095
<i>Contact in five minutes.</i>

772
01:01:56,178 --> 01:01:57,972
So, what happens now?

773
01:01:58,055 --> 01:02:00,599
They'll call a carryall
to lift the crawler.

774
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:02,810
They'll harvest right up
to the last minute.

775
01:02:02,893 --> 01:02:04,520
<i>Calling
carryall Alpha Zero.</i>

776
01:02:04,603 --> 01:02:06,439
<i>Ready for docking sequence.</i>

777
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:08,983
<i>Contact five minutes. Over.</i>

778
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:15,489
<i>Anybody got a visual
on the carryall?</i>

779
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:21,203
There it is.

780
01:02:21,287 --> 01:02:22,621
<i>This is carryall Alpha Zero</i>

781
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:25,040
<i>to Delta Ajax niner.</i>

782
01:02:25,124 --> 01:02:27,168
<i>Approaching from your east.</i>

783
01:02:27,251 --> 01:02:30,129
<i>Correcting altitude and
preparing docking equipment.</i>

784
01:02:30,212 --> 01:02:33,716
{\an3}<i>Copy, Alpha Zero.
Initiating docking sequence.</i>

785
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,261
<i>T-5.</i>

786
01:02:37,344 --> 01:02:38,804
<i>Copy that.</i>

787
01:02:38,888 --> 01:02:40,639
<i>Prepare
to be airborne in 30 seconds.</i>

788
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:43,017
{\an3}<i>Docking sequence
initiated. Brace yourselves.</i>

789
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:48,439
<i>Alpha Zero, we're short
one point of contact.</i>

790
01:02:48,522 --> 01:02:49,982
<i>What is going on?</i>

791
01:02:50,065 --> 01:02:52,067
<i>It's one of
the anchors. It's dead.</i>

792
01:02:53,068 --> 01:02:54,445
Shit.

793
01:02:54,528 --> 01:02:56,572
<i>Carryall
unable to receive.</i>

794
01:02:56,655 --> 01:02:58,532
<i>Unable to lift
without that anchor.</i>

795
01:02:58,616 --> 01:03:00,326
<i>All call! All call!</i>

796
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:03,370
<i>Any carryall in the sector,
please respond!</i>

797
01:03:03,454 --> 01:03:05,414
<i>Spotter One,
give us an update. Over.</i>

798
01:03:05,498 --> 01:03:06,957
<i>Hydraulics are dead.</i>

799
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:08,626
<i>We won't make it.
You have to evacuate.</i>

800
01:03:08,709 --> 01:03:09,794
<i>Contact in four minutes.</i>

801
01:03:09,877 --> 01:03:10,836
<i>Try it again!</i>

802
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:11,629
How many men on that crawler?

803
01:03:11,712 --> 01:03:12,797
Crew of 21.

804
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:13,881
Our ships
can take six each.

805
01:03:13,964 --> 01:03:15,132
That's still three short.

806
01:03:15,841 --> 01:03:16,884
We'll find a way.

807
01:03:29,188 --> 01:03:31,440
<i>This is Duke Leto Atreides.</i>

808
01:03:31,524 --> 01:03:35,152
<i>We're coming down to extract
the crew of Delta Ajax niner.</i>

809
01:03:35,236 --> 01:03:37,238
<i>We'll set down on the west.</i>

810
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:49,542
Shield generators
weigh 100 kilos each.

811
01:03:50,292 --> 01:03:51,669
Yes, Gurney,

812
01:03:51,752 --> 01:03:53,045
have our escorts throw out
the shield generators.

813
01:03:53,128 --> 01:03:54,672
Yes, sire.

814
01:03:54,755 --> 01:03:56,340
And, Paul, I want you
at the back of the thopter.

815
01:03:56,423 --> 01:03:57,508
Guide them in.

816
01:03:57,591 --> 01:03:58,801
Delta Ajax niner,

817
01:03:58,884 --> 01:04:01,387
put seven men each
in my ships now.

818
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:01,739
<i>Contact in two minutes.</i>

819
01:05:03,824 --> 01:05:06,660
<i>Getting close, guys.
We better abandon ship now.</i>

820
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:10,331
Where are they?

821
01:05:10,414 --> 01:05:12,458
<i>Sir,
there's protocol for a reason.</i>

822
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:15,252
<i>If we take one step out there,
we're as good as dead.</i>

823
01:05:15,336 --> 01:05:16,962
<i>Besides, we've got
a full load of spice.</i>

824
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:19,089
- <i>We can't just leave it.</i>
- Damn the spice!

825
01:05:19,173 --> 01:05:21,800
I want every man
off that crawler now!

826
01:05:35,773 --> 01:05:36,857
Hey!

827
01:05:36,941 --> 01:05:38,025
Hey!

828
01:05:38,108 --> 01:05:40,653
Seven over here,
seven over there.

829
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:44,990
Go! Go! Go!

830
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:02,883
Kwisatz Haderach.

831
01:06:16,063 --> 01:06:19,525
Kwisatz Haderach <i>awakes.</i>

832
01:06:28,993 --> 01:06:30,369
Hurry! Get on!

833
01:06:39,044 --> 01:06:40,129
It's here!

834
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:44,133
Paul!

835
01:06:46,593 --> 01:06:47,845
Paul!

836
01:06:51,682 --> 01:06:55,102
I recognize
your footsteps, old man.

837
01:06:55,769 --> 01:06:57,354
Get up!

838
01:06:57,438 --> 01:06:59,982
Let's go!

839
01:07:00,065 --> 01:07:02,693
What's the matter with you?
Come on! Let's go!

840
01:07:02,776 --> 01:07:04,028
Run!

841
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:30,763
Hey!

842
01:07:49,281 --> 01:07:51,700
Bless the Maker and His Water.

843
01:07:51,784 --> 01:07:53,994
Bless the coming
and going of Him.

844
01:07:54,078 --> 01:07:56,997
May His passage
cleanse the world

845
01:07:57,081 --> 01:07:59,583
and keep the world
for His people.

846
01:08:23,565 --> 01:08:24,817
Hey!

847
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,944
- You cannot take such risks.
- Yes, sir.

848
01:08:27,027 --> 01:08:28,320
You have responsibilities.

849
01:08:28,403 --> 01:08:29,530
I... I'm sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.

850
01:08:29,613 --> 01:08:30,614
Go.

851
01:08:31,448 --> 01:08:32,741
Dr. Kynes.

852
01:08:34,576 --> 01:08:36,412
You saw it.

853
01:08:36,495 --> 01:08:38,497
With your own eyes.
It's plain to see.

854
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:40,833
Everything they've left us
is in shambles.

855
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:42,835
We've been set up to fail.

856
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:45,629
That carryall was just old.

857
01:08:45,712 --> 01:08:47,756
The desert
isn't kind to equipment.

858
01:08:49,633 --> 01:08:51,176
You know what will happen

859
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,762
if I don't get spice
production back on track.

860
01:08:55,722 --> 01:08:59,560
I'm not here
to take your part.

861
01:08:59,643 --> 01:09:03,689
Arrakis has seen men like you
come and go.

862
01:09:06,316 --> 01:09:09,945
Take good care of your family.

863
01:09:13,282 --> 01:09:16,410
The desert's not kind
to humans either.

864
01:09:32,801 --> 01:09:35,888
Spice is a psychoactive
chemical.

865
01:09:37,055 --> 01:09:39,016
You seem to be sensitive.

866
01:09:43,395 --> 01:09:44,438
You'll be fine.

867
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:48,192
Thank you, Dr. Yueh.

868
01:09:57,576 --> 01:10:00,078
That wasn't
an allergic reaction.

869
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:03,665
I had a vision.

870
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:07,920
My eyes were wide open.

871
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:10,923
What did you see?

872
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:52,130
Kwisatz Haderach.

873
01:10:52,214 --> 01:10:55,259
<i>You can see.</i>

874
01:11:36,675 --> 01:11:38,343
<i>It's confusing.</i>

875
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:39,970
<i>I thought I saw my death,</i>

876
01:11:40,053 --> 01:11:42,222
<i>only it wasn't.</i>

877
01:11:42,306 --> 01:11:46,184
<i>I know a knife is important,
somehow.</i>

878
01:11:48,103 --> 01:11:50,480
<i>Someone will hand me a blade,</i>

879
01:11:50,564 --> 01:11:54,276
<i>but I don't know who,
or when, or where.</i>

880
01:11:56,361 --> 01:11:59,364
<i>Some things, though,
are crystal clear.</i>

881
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:00,782
<i>I can feel it.</i>

882
01:12:05,495 --> 01:12:07,039
<i>I know you're pregnant.</i>

883
01:12:13,128 --> 01:12:14,921
You can't know that.

884
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:17,674
I barely know that.

885
01:12:17,758 --> 01:12:19,760
It's only been a few weeks.

886
01:13:10,894 --> 01:13:12,145
Atreides legions

887
01:13:12,229 --> 01:13:14,564
are the finest
in the Imperium.

888
01:13:14,648 --> 01:13:17,025
Trained by Gurney Halleck
and Duncan Idaho.

889
01:13:25,492 --> 01:13:26,952
Just so.

890
01:13:27,828 --> 01:13:29,496
Three battalions.

891
01:13:29,579 --> 01:13:30,622
As agreed.

892
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:13,331
There is something
you need to know about Paul.

893
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:15,333
No.

894
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:17,836
Don't think I want to know.

895
01:14:17,919 --> 01:14:19,921
Ever since you brought him
before your Reverend Mother,

896
01:14:20,005 --> 01:14:21,840
he hasn't been the same.

897
01:14:23,508 --> 01:14:24,801
He's distracted.

898
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:29,848
Jessica, you gave me a son.

899
01:14:29,931 --> 01:14:31,308
And from the moment
he was born,

900
01:14:31,391 --> 01:14:33,268
I never questioned you.

901
01:14:33,351 --> 01:14:35,812
I trusted you completely.

902
01:14:35,896 --> 01:14:38,064
Even when
you walked in shadows.

903
01:14:39,232 --> 01:14:41,193
Now I'm asking you
this one thing.

904
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:45,989
If anything happens...

905
01:14:47,073 --> 01:14:48,450
will you protect our son?

906
01:14:50,202 --> 01:14:51,703
With my life.

907
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:54,206
I'm not asking his mother.
I'm asking the Bene Gesserit.

908
01:14:58,418 --> 01:15:00,462
Will you protect Paul?

909
01:15:06,051 --> 01:15:08,053
Why are you
having these thoughts?

910
01:15:14,518 --> 01:15:17,062
Leto, this is not you.

911
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:25,070
I thought we'd have more time.

912
01:15:44,005 --> 01:15:46,633
Have a good night,
Master Paul.

913
01:15:46,716 --> 01:15:48,635
Good night, Dr. Yueh.

914
01:15:57,936 --> 01:15:59,354
<i>You need to sleep.</i>

915
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:02,566
No.

916
01:16:02,649 --> 01:16:03,942
Not like that.

917
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:21,459
I should have married you.

918
01:17:39,704 --> 01:17:41,456
Hawat. Security.

919
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:45,210
Security.

920
01:18:48,106 --> 01:18:49,774
Sir. Sir.

921
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:52,444
The shield's come down.

922
01:19:01,327 --> 01:19:03,288
God in heaven.

923
01:19:03,371 --> 01:19:06,332
Get everything with guns
off the ground! Go!

924
01:19:50,335 --> 01:19:52,128
Go! Go! Go!

925
01:20:54,023 --> 01:20:56,025
With me! With me!

926
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:26,097
Atreides!

927
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:27,348
Atreides!

928
01:21:56,211 --> 01:21:58,588
- Sardaukar!
- Sardaukar!

929
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:23,738
I'm sorry, my lord.

930
01:22:26,574 --> 01:22:29,535
But I've made a bargain
with the Baron.

931
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,081
Why?

932
01:22:33,957 --> 01:22:36,000
I had no choice.

933
01:22:36,084 --> 01:22:39,921
The Harkonnens
have my wife, Wanna.

934
01:22:40,004 --> 01:22:42,548
They take her apart
like a doll.

935
01:22:43,549 --> 01:22:45,677
I will buy her freedom.

936
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,345
And you are the price.

937
01:22:50,682 --> 01:22:53,726
For Paul.
I will do what I can.

938
01:22:54,435 --> 01:22:56,145
And you

939
01:22:56,229 --> 01:22:58,106
will kill a man for me.

940
01:23:02,485 --> 01:23:06,030
I'm going to replace
your peg tooth.

941
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:11,035
If you bite down hard,
this tooth will crush.

942
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:15,373
Breathe out, and you will
fill the air with poison.

943
01:23:15,456 --> 01:23:18,167
It will be your last breath.

944
01:23:18,251 --> 01:23:20,586
But if you choose
your moment well,

945
01:23:21,879 --> 01:23:24,173
it will also be the Baron's.

946
01:24:57,892 --> 01:24:58,976
Paul.

947
01:26:21,809 --> 01:26:23,561
To hell, dogs!

948
01:27:59,156 --> 01:28:01,951
I've never had a highborn.

949
01:28:04,328 --> 01:28:05,663
You?

950
01:28:05,746 --> 01:28:07,832
Bene Gesserit
ain't all highborn.

951
01:28:07,915 --> 01:28:11,711
She's highborn enough for me.

952
01:28:11,794 --> 01:28:14,046
Let's feed the kid
to the worms.

953
01:28:14,130 --> 01:28:16,132
And give her a long goodbye.

954
01:28:16,215 --> 01:28:18,009
Don't you dare
touch my mother.

955
01:28:19,468 --> 01:28:20,511
Don't talk.

956
01:28:31,856 --> 01:28:33,357
Remove her gag.

957
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:44,243
Shut up.

958
01:29:13,189 --> 01:29:14,440
Remove her gag.

959
01:29:20,529 --> 01:29:21,739
Kill him.

960
01:29:30,706 --> 01:29:31,874
Set us free.

961
01:29:45,346 --> 01:29:46,680
Stop!

962
01:29:46,764 --> 01:29:48,307
Cut the rope.

963
01:29:51,018 --> 01:29:52,478
Give me the knife.

964
01:30:01,195 --> 01:30:04,281
Your pitch was too forced.

965
01:30:12,164 --> 01:30:13,749
It's a fremkit.

966
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:27,930
They've crippled the ship.

967
01:31:40,961 --> 01:31:42,129
Mmm.

968
01:32:00,439 --> 01:32:01,857
Ah.

969
01:32:03,317 --> 01:32:06,403
You have a wonderful kitchen,
cousin.

970
01:32:24,588 --> 01:32:27,424
This is Dr. Yueh's
handwriting.

971
01:32:27,508 --> 01:32:30,094
"If anyone makes it out
of Arrakeen alive,

972
01:32:30,177 --> 01:32:32,304
there's an Atreides beacon
in the fremkit.

973
01:32:32,388 --> 01:32:35,140
God willing,
they'll be able to find you."

974
01:32:42,481 --> 01:32:43,524
My lord Baron.

975
01:32:44,942 --> 01:32:46,110
Dr. Yueh.

976
01:32:46,193 --> 01:32:47,861
The traitor.

977
01:32:49,071 --> 01:32:50,197
What do you want?

978
01:32:51,365 --> 01:32:53,617
I jammed their comms

979
01:32:53,701 --> 01:32:55,703
and lowered their shields.

980
01:32:55,786 --> 01:32:57,037
Hmm.

981
01:32:57,121 --> 01:32:59,373
I delivered
the Duke and his family.

982
01:32:59,456 --> 01:33:01,959
The bargain
to the letter.

983
01:33:02,042 --> 01:33:04,545
And what was I to do for you?

984
01:33:04,628 --> 01:33:06,797
Deliver my wife
from her agony.

985
01:33:08,716 --> 01:33:09,800
Yes.

986
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:45,878
I said I'd set her free.

987
01:33:45,961 --> 01:33:47,796
That you could join her.

988
01:33:51,925 --> 01:33:53,844
So, join her.

989
01:34:02,728 --> 01:34:04,980
What do you think is next?

990
01:34:08,651 --> 01:34:10,944
It's a thumper.

991
01:34:11,028 --> 01:34:12,613
No stillsuits.

992
01:34:12,696 --> 01:34:14,615
The one thing
we actually need.

993
01:34:19,703 --> 01:34:23,290
For hundreds of years,
we've traded blood for blood.

994
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:26,168
But no more.

995
01:34:27,628 --> 01:34:31,882
Your son is dead.
Your concubine is dead.

996
01:34:31,965 --> 01:34:34,843
Tonight
the House of Atreides falls.

997
01:34:37,638 --> 01:34:40,724
And your bloodline
ends forever.

998
01:34:53,904 --> 01:34:54,947
What did you say?

999
01:35:04,998 --> 01:35:06,458
Here I am...

1000
01:35:07,751 --> 01:35:09,545
<i>here I remain.</i>

1001
01:36:52,773 --> 01:36:53,982
Kynes!

1002
01:36:55,234 --> 01:36:57,027
It's not safe for you here.

1003
01:36:57,110 --> 01:36:58,362
Will you tell
the Great Houses

1004
01:36:58,445 --> 01:36:59,905
of the Landsraad
how we were betrayed?

1005
01:36:59,988 --> 01:37:02,574
How the best of them
were murdered?

1006
01:37:02,658 --> 01:37:05,327
I am commanded to say nothing.

1007
01:37:06,286 --> 01:37:07,996
To see nothing.

1008
01:37:09,832 --> 01:37:12,209
The Emperor
sent us here to die.

1009
01:38:00,424 --> 01:38:02,801
There's spice
in the tent.

1010
01:39:28,428 --> 01:39:31,390
{\an8}That's the future.
It's coming.

1011
01:39:45,946 --> 01:39:48,156
{\an8}Holy war
spreading across the universe

1012
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:49,533
{\an8}like unquenchable fire.

1013
01:40:02,462 --> 01:40:05,382
Paul, you're scared.
I can see it.

1014
01:40:05,465 --> 01:40:08,552
Tell me, please,
what do you fear?

1015
01:40:17,519 --> 01:40:20,022
{\an8}Somebody help me, please.

1016
01:40:20,731 --> 01:40:21,898
Paul.

1017
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:25,902
It's coming.

1018
01:40:25,986 --> 01:40:27,404
<i>I see a holy war spreading</i>

1019
01:40:27,487 --> 01:40:29,406
<i>across the universe
like unquenchable fire.</i>

1020
01:40:29,489 --> 01:40:32,492
A warrior religion
that waves the Atreides banner

1021
01:40:32,576 --> 01:40:33,744
in my father's name.

1022
01:40:33,827 --> 01:40:34,745
Paul.

1023
01:40:34,828 --> 01:40:36,496
Fanatical legions worshipping

1024
01:40:36,580 --> 01:40:38,749
<i>at the shrine
of my father's skull.</i>

1025
01:40:39,583 --> 01:40:42,044
<i>A war in my name!</i>

1026
01:40:42,127 --> 01:40:43,962
Everyone's shouting my name!

1027
01:40:44,046 --> 01:40:45,047
Paul.

1028
01:40:48,717 --> 01:40:50,802
Paul Atreides.

1029
01:40:50,886 --> 01:40:53,847
You are your father's son.
You are my son.

1030
01:40:53,930 --> 01:40:57,434
You are
the Duke Paul Atreides.

1031
01:40:57,517 --> 01:41:00,312
You know who you are.
You know who you are.

1032
01:41:00,395 --> 01:41:01,563
Get off me!

1033
01:41:03,482 --> 01:41:05,150
You did this to me!

1034
01:41:05,233 --> 01:41:07,944
You Bene Gesserit
made me a freak!

1035
01:41:33,053 --> 01:41:35,347
My father is dead.

1036
01:42:11,842 --> 01:42:13,343
Someone's near.

1037
01:42:14,261 --> 01:42:15,762
You need to drink.

1038
01:42:17,347 --> 01:42:19,641
It's recycled water
from the tent.

1039
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,234
Sweat and tears.

1040
01:42:32,904 --> 01:42:34,614
All right,
let's get out of here.

1041
01:43:47,854 --> 01:43:49,606
That's Duncan.

1042
01:43:56,696 --> 01:43:57,948
Duncan.

1043
01:43:59,574 --> 01:44:00,784
My lady.

1044
01:44:00,867 --> 01:44:02,285
Paul.

1045
01:44:02,369 --> 01:44:04,746
I'm so sorry. Your father...

1046
01:44:04,829 --> 01:44:06,039
We know.

1047
01:44:07,958 --> 01:44:09,292
My lord Duke.

1048
01:44:23,056 --> 01:44:24,057
Here.

1049
01:44:26,142 --> 01:44:27,644
Drink this.

1050
01:44:34,901 --> 01:44:37,279
Harkonnens hit
every population center

1051
01:44:37,362 --> 01:44:38,822
on the planet at once.

1052
01:44:38,905 --> 01:44:41,032
There must have been
10 legions, hundreds of ships.

1053
01:44:41,116 --> 01:44:43,159
There were Sardaukar
with them.

1054
01:44:43,243 --> 01:44:45,787
- At least two battalions.
- What? Are you sure?

1055
01:44:45,870 --> 01:44:48,540
You cross swords
with a Sardaukar,

1056
01:44:48,623 --> 01:44:50,000
you know it.

1057
01:44:50,083 --> 01:44:54,838
So,
the Emperor's taken a side.

1058
01:44:54,921 --> 01:44:58,049
What says
the Judge of the Change?

1059
01:44:58,133 --> 01:45:00,176
The Emperor forbids me
from saying anything at all.

1060
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:02,220
And yet you risk your life
to help us.

1061
01:45:22,699 --> 01:45:24,409
Storm's coming.

1062
01:45:38,298 --> 01:45:40,550
The storm
will be here in a few hours.

1063
01:45:40,633 --> 01:45:41,760
We'll be safe here.

1064
01:45:43,303 --> 01:45:45,555
Do you know
what this place is?

1065
01:45:45,638 --> 01:45:48,058
It's an old
ecological testing station.

1066
01:45:51,436 --> 01:45:53,271
They were meant
to tame the planet.

1067
01:45:53,355 --> 01:45:55,774
Free the water
locked beneath the sands.

1068
01:45:58,777 --> 01:46:01,404
Arrakis could have been
a paradise.

1069
01:46:01,488 --> 01:46:02,614
The work had begun,

1070
01:46:02,697 --> 01:46:04,366
but then the spice
was discovered.

1071
01:46:04,449 --> 01:46:07,452
And suddenly no one
wanted the desert to go away.

1072
01:46:07,535 --> 01:46:08,745
Tanat,

1073
01:46:08,828 --> 01:46:10,413
will you find stillsuits
to fit our visitors?

1074
01:46:10,497 --> 01:46:11,748
Yes, Liet.

1075
01:46:11,831 --> 01:46:13,249
Shamir,
a coffee service, please.

1076
01:46:13,333 --> 01:46:14,793
Of course, Liet.

1077
01:46:17,128 --> 01:46:19,047
Who are you to the Fremen?

1078
01:47:09,055 --> 01:47:10,807
You know what
the Great Houses fear most,

1079
01:47:10,890 --> 01:47:12,475
Dr. Kynes?

1080
01:47:13,726 --> 01:47:15,979
Exactly what has happened
to us here.

1081
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:18,148
The Sardaukar coming

1082
01:47:18,231 --> 01:47:19,941
and picking them off
one by one.

1083
01:47:22,902 --> 01:47:24,529
Only together
can they stand a chance

1084
01:47:24,612 --> 01:47:26,114
against the Imperium.

1085
01:47:28,158 --> 01:47:30,326
Would you bear witness?

1086
01:47:30,410 --> 01:47:33,538
Testify that the Emperor
has moved against us here?

1087
01:47:33,621 --> 01:47:36,541
If they believe me,

1088
01:47:36,624 --> 01:47:38,334
there would be general warfare

1089
01:47:38,418 --> 01:47:40,628
between the Great Houses
and the Emperor.

1090
01:47:40,712 --> 01:47:42,297
Chaos

1091
01:47:42,380 --> 01:47:43,840
across the Imperium.

1092
01:47:43,923 --> 01:47:45,341
Suppose I presented
the Emperor

1093
01:47:45,425 --> 01:47:47,886
with an alternative to chaos.

1094
01:47:47,969 --> 01:47:49,888
The Emperor has no sons.

1095
01:47:49,971 --> 01:47:51,973
And his daughters
have yet to marry.

1096
01:47:52,056 --> 01:47:54,851
You'd make a play
for the throne?

1097
01:47:54,934 --> 01:47:56,686
The Emperor
feared the Atreides.

1098
01:47:56,769 --> 01:47:58,438
He brought you here
to kill you.

1099
01:47:58,521 --> 01:48:01,024
What don't you understand?

1100
01:48:01,107 --> 01:48:04,277
You're a lost boy hiding
in a hole in the ground.

1101
01:48:08,490 --> 01:48:11,242
The Fremen speak
of the <i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>

1102
01:48:12,243 --> 01:48:14,078
Careful.

1103
01:48:14,162 --> 01:48:15,330
The Voice from the Outer World

1104
01:48:15,413 --> 01:48:17,582
who will lead them
to paradise.

1105
01:48:18,917 --> 01:48:20,126
Superstition.

1106
01:48:24,923 --> 01:48:26,674
I know you loved
a Fremen warrior

1107
01:48:26,758 --> 01:48:28,051
and lost him in battle.

1108
01:48:31,262 --> 01:48:34,974
I know you walk in two worlds
and are known by many names.

1109
01:48:40,230 --> 01:48:42,106
I've seen your dream.

1110
01:48:46,236 --> 01:48:47,445
As emperor, Dr. Kynes,

1111
01:48:47,529 --> 01:48:49,447
I could make
a paradise of Arrakis

1112
01:48:49,531 --> 01:48:51,074
with a wave of my hand.

1113
01:50:46,856 --> 01:50:47,899
Sardaukar!

1114
01:50:51,027 --> 01:50:52,236
No! Duncan!

1115
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:53,571
Paul, no!

1116
01:50:53,655 --> 01:50:54,947
- Duncan, no!
- No!

1117
01:50:56,115 --> 01:50:57,408
- No!
- Paul, no!

1118
01:50:58,618 --> 01:50:59,911
Duncan, no!

1119
01:50:59,994 --> 01:51:02,455
- He's locked the door.
- Duncan! No!

1120
01:51:51,838 --> 01:51:53,423
He's gone.

1121
01:51:53,506 --> 01:51:54,590
Duncan!

1122
01:51:54,674 --> 01:51:56,259
We have to go.
We have no choice.

1123
01:52:03,850 --> 01:52:06,269
Paul, go! Paul!

1124
01:52:25,163 --> 01:52:26,831
Come on.
Come on, come on!

1125
01:52:58,196 --> 01:52:59,864
Follow the light.

1126
01:52:59,947 --> 01:53:02,158
You'll find a thopter
ready to fly.

1127
01:53:02,241 --> 01:53:04,118
That storm out there
is your best shot.

1128
01:53:04,202 --> 01:53:06,788
Above 5,000 meters,
it's mostly dust.

1129
01:53:06,871 --> 01:53:11,000
Climb into it. Stay on top.
Head south. Find the Fremen.

1130
01:53:11,083 --> 01:53:12,335
Are you not coming with us?

1131
01:53:12,418 --> 01:53:13,628
It only seats two.

1132
01:53:13,711 --> 01:53:15,421
I'll go to the next station

1133
01:53:15,505 --> 01:53:17,215
and report this attack
to the Landsraad.

1134
01:53:17,298 --> 01:53:18,591
How?

1135
01:53:19,342 --> 01:53:21,260
I'm Fremen.

1136
01:53:21,344 --> 01:53:23,554
The desert's my home.

1137
01:53:23,638 --> 01:53:24,722
Good luck.

1138
01:53:24,806 --> 01:53:26,015
Good luck.

1139
01:56:07,093 --> 01:56:09,512
{\an8}I serve only one master.

1140
01:56:09,595 --> 01:56:12,932
His name is <i>Shai-Hulud.</i>

1141
01:56:57,977 --> 01:56:59,562
There are jet flares
behind us.

1142
01:57:33,387 --> 01:57:35,306
Paul. We're not high enough!

1143
01:58:08,047 --> 01:58:09,381
I must not fear.

1144
01:58:09,465 --> 01:58:11,133
Fear is the mind-killer.

1145
01:58:11,217 --> 01:58:14,970
Fear is the little death
that brings obliteration.

1146
01:58:20,559 --> 01:58:23,521
<i>See the friend.</i>

1147
01:58:27,316 --> 01:58:30,194
<i>See the friend.</i>

1148
01:58:32,905 --> 01:58:35,699
<i>The mystery of life
isn't a problem to solve...</i>

1149
01:58:38,911 --> 01:58:41,288
<i>but a reality to experience.</i>

1150
01:58:44,583 --> 01:58:46,836
A process
that cannot be understood

1151
01:58:46,919 --> 01:58:49,171
by stopping it.

1152
01:58:49,255 --> 01:58:51,674
We must move
with the flow of the process.

1153
01:58:52,633 --> 01:58:55,136
<i>We must join it.</i>

1154
01:58:55,219 --> 01:58:57,012
<i>We must flow with it.</i>

1155
01:58:57,096 --> 01:58:58,722
<i>Let go.</i>

1156
01:58:58,806 --> 01:59:00,808
<i>Let go.</i>

1157
01:59:47,646 --> 01:59:51,775
We chased them
into a Coriolis storm.

1158
01:59:53,277 --> 01:59:55,863
Winds at 800 kilometers
an hour.

1159
02:00:00,534 --> 02:00:02,828
Nothing survives such a storm.

1160
02:00:02,912 --> 02:00:04,330
They're dead.

1161
02:00:05,748 --> 02:00:07,583
It's a certainty.

1162
02:00:14,590 --> 02:00:16,884
So, it's done. Finally.

1163
02:00:19,011 --> 02:00:20,846
Send word to Giedi Prime

1164
02:00:20,930 --> 02:00:23,766
to begin selling
our spice reserves.

1165
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:26,685
But slowly.

1166
02:00:26,769 --> 02:00:29,438
We don't want
the price to fall.

1167
02:00:29,521 --> 02:00:31,023
You have no idea
how much it cost me

1168
02:00:31,106 --> 02:00:33,609
to bring such a force
to bear here.

1169
02:00:33,692 --> 02:00:36,570
Now I only have
one requirement.

1170
02:00:36,654 --> 02:00:37,780
Income.

1171
02:00:38,614 --> 02:00:40,407
So, squeeze, Rabban.

1172
02:00:41,158 --> 02:00:42,618
Squeeze hard.

1173
02:00:42,701 --> 02:00:44,078
Yes, Uncle.

1174
02:00:45,663 --> 02:00:46,789
And the Fremen?

1175
02:00:47,915 --> 02:00:49,333
Kill them all.

1176
02:01:12,398 --> 02:01:14,358
We're above
5,000 meters.

1177
02:02:52,122 --> 02:02:54,083
As soon as we land,
run for the rocks.

1178
02:04:47,237 --> 02:04:49,072
And breathe through this.

1179
02:05:19,269 --> 02:05:21,563
<i>Now
we have to find the Fremen.</i>

1180
02:05:23,106 --> 02:05:24,441
<i>Are you good?</i>

1181
02:05:24,525 --> 02:05:25,901
<i>Yeah.</i>

1182
02:06:32,759 --> 02:06:34,511
<i>Paul...</i>

1183
02:06:41,059 --> 02:06:44,896
<i>Don't be frightened.</i>

1184
02:06:44,980 --> 02:06:48,191
<i>Even a little
desert mouse can survive.</i>

1185
02:06:49,234 --> 02:06:52,404
<i>Don't be frightened.</i>

1186
02:06:52,487 --> 02:06:54,323
<i>You'll need
to face your fears.</i>

1187
02:06:54,406 --> 02:06:55,991
<i>A friend...</i>

1188
02:06:56,074 --> 02:06:59,202
<i>A friend will help you.</i>

1189
02:07:00,579 --> 02:07:02,414
<i>Follow the friend.</i>

1190
02:07:05,250 --> 02:07:06,585
<i>You have much to learn.</i>

1191
02:07:08,795 --> 02:07:11,590
And I will show you
the ways of the desert.

1192
02:07:14,926 --> 02:07:16,511
Come with me.

1193
02:07:44,122 --> 02:07:47,876
<i>The</i> sietch
<i>where Duncan lived</i>

1194
02:07:47,959 --> 02:07:50,128
<i>is somewhere off that way.</i>

1195
02:07:52,297 --> 02:07:55,300
<i>I can see
greenery over there.</i>

1196
02:07:55,384 --> 02:07:56,551
<i>There.</i>

1197
02:07:56,635 --> 02:07:58,637
<i>That means
Fremen live there.</i>

1198
02:08:02,974 --> 02:08:05,102
<i>We'll cross after dark.</i>

1199
02:08:05,185 --> 02:08:07,187
<i>That's how the Fremen do it.</i>

1200
02:08:10,148 --> 02:08:12,651
<i>We're about to enter
worm territory.</i>

1201
02:08:12,734 --> 02:08:14,569
<i>We can't walk
like regular humans.</i>

1202
02:08:14,653 --> 02:08:16,071
<i>If we do, we're dead.</i>

1203
02:08:16,154 --> 02:08:18,156
<i>We'll have to walk
like the Fremen do.</i>

1204
02:08:18,240 --> 02:08:19,783
<i>It's called a sandwalk.</i>

1205
02:08:19,866 --> 02:08:22,536
<i>At least according
to the filmbooks back home.</i>

1206
02:08:22,619 --> 02:08:24,037
<i>Yeah. Yeah, okay.</i>

1207
02:08:24,121 --> 02:08:25,664
<i>Okay. Follow me.</i>

1208
02:08:25,747 --> 02:08:27,499
<i>Do the same moves.</i>

1209
02:08:40,679 --> 02:08:42,305
<i>I think this is
the right direction.</i>

1210
02:10:04,888 --> 02:10:05,972
<i>It's close by.</i>

1211
02:10:06,848 --> 02:10:08,767
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

1212
02:10:09,601 --> 02:10:12,479
<i>Wait.</i>

1213
02:10:12,562 --> 02:10:14,439
<i>It's drum sand.</i>

1214
02:10:19,069 --> 02:10:21,029
<i>run.</i>

1215
02:10:26,952 --> 02:10:28,662
<i>Go! Go!</i>

1216
02:11:40,775 --> 02:11:41,902
<i>It's a thumper.</i>

1217
02:11:47,198 --> 02:11:49,200
<i>Someone set off a thumper.</i>

1218
02:12:03,757 --> 02:12:06,009
<i>Paul! Run!</i>

1219
02:12:20,690 --> 02:12:22,025
How big are they?

1220
02:12:22,108 --> 02:12:23,318
That was insane.

1221
02:12:28,031 --> 02:12:29,574
Someone called it.

1222
02:13:01,523 --> 02:13:04,067
<i>Do not run.</i>

1223
02:13:04,150 --> 02:13:06,778
<i>You will only waste
your body's water.</i>

1224
02:13:07,779 --> 02:13:08,822
<i>Hold.</i>

1225
02:13:16,496 --> 02:13:17,372
Stilgar.

1226
02:13:17,455 --> 02:13:19,040
Hey!

1227
02:13:19,124 --> 02:13:20,375
You know me. I was there

1228
02:13:20,458 --> 02:13:22,210
when you came
to my father's Council.

1229
02:13:22,293 --> 02:13:23,253
Oh.

1230
02:13:23,336 --> 02:13:25,380
This is the Duke's son.

1231
02:13:25,463 --> 02:13:27,090
Why are you waiting?

1232
02:13:27,173 --> 02:13:29,050
We need their water.

1233
02:13:29,134 --> 02:13:31,386
This is the boy
I told you about.

1234
02:13:31,469 --> 02:13:32,721
We can't touch him.

1235
02:13:37,100 --> 02:13:38,476
{\an8}They are weaklings.

1236
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:40,311
Jamis.

1237
02:13:40,395 --> 02:13:42,272
That was a brave crossing
they made

1238
02:13:42,355 --> 02:13:45,233
in the path of <i>Shai-Hulud.</i>

1239
02:13:45,316 --> 02:13:48,445
He does not speak
or act like a weakling.

1240
02:13:49,487 --> 02:13:51,197
Nor did his father.

1241
02:13:51,281 --> 02:13:53,908
My thumper
saved his life.

1242
02:13:53,992 --> 02:13:56,453
Go back to reason, Stilgar.

1243
02:13:56,536 --> 02:13:58,246
He's not The One.

1244
02:14:00,999 --> 02:14:02,667
We have powerful friends.

1245
02:14:02,751 --> 02:14:05,920
You help us off-world,
to Caladan,

1246
02:14:06,004 --> 02:14:07,255
you will be well rewarded.

1247
02:14:07,338 --> 02:14:10,133
What wealth can you offer
beyond the water

1248
02:14:10,216 --> 02:14:11,760
in your flesh?

1249
02:14:14,554 --> 02:14:16,598
Hmm...

1250
02:14:16,681 --> 02:14:18,308
The boy is young.

1251
02:14:18,391 --> 02:14:20,602
He can learn our ways.

1252
02:14:20,685 --> 02:14:23,313
He may have sanctuary.

1253
02:14:23,396 --> 02:14:25,732
But the woman is untrained...

1254
02:14:28,401 --> 02:14:29,903
and too old to learn.

1255
02:15:01,267 --> 02:15:03,394
back, you dogs.

1256
02:15:05,021 --> 02:15:07,232
She'll cut my throat.

1257
02:15:12,195 --> 02:15:14,697
Why didn't you say
you were a weirding woman?

1258
02:15:14,781 --> 02:15:16,449
And a fighter?

1259
02:15:16,533 --> 02:15:18,701
Conversation ran short.

1260
02:15:18,785 --> 02:15:20,995
Peace, woman.

1261
02:15:21,079 --> 02:15:22,413
Peace.

1262
02:15:23,206 --> 02:15:24,749
I judged hastily.

1263
02:16:03,955 --> 02:16:06,374
<i>I would not
have let you hurt my friends.</i>

1264
02:16:31,649 --> 02:16:34,235
They say you're the <i>Mahdi.</i>

1265
02:16:34,319 --> 02:16:36,154
But you look
like a little boy.

1266
02:16:37,655 --> 02:16:39,115
You chose the hardest way up.

1267
02:16:39,199 --> 02:16:40,533
Follow me.

1268
02:16:47,999 --> 02:16:49,584
Give it to me.

1269
02:16:56,507 --> 02:16:58,218
You will have
your own maula pistol

1270
02:16:58,301 --> 02:17:00,220
when you've earned it.

1271
02:17:00,303 --> 02:17:01,346
Give it to me.

1272
02:17:07,101 --> 02:17:09,229
Chani, take charge
of the newcomers.

1273
02:17:09,312 --> 02:17:11,940
See that they are safe
on the journey. Let's go.

1274
02:17:12,023 --> 02:17:13,441
I will not have them.

1275
02:17:20,365 --> 02:17:21,783
Jamis,

1276
02:17:21,866 --> 02:17:24,202
I have spoken. Be still.

1277
02:17:24,285 --> 02:17:25,870
You talk like a leader.

1278
02:17:26,871 --> 02:17:28,748
But the strongest leads.

1279
02:17:30,041 --> 02:17:31,834
She bested you.

1280
02:17:33,253 --> 02:17:35,546
I invoke the amtal.

1281
02:17:35,630 --> 02:17:38,049
You may not challenge
a <i>Sayyadina.</i>

1282
02:17:38,132 --> 02:17:39,634
Then who will fight
in her name?

1283
02:17:39,717 --> 02:17:42,470
Jamis, don't do this.

1284
02:17:42,553 --> 02:17:44,639
Don't. The night is fading.

1285
02:17:44,722 --> 02:17:47,642
Then the sun
will witness this death.

1286
02:17:47,725 --> 02:17:49,769
Where is her champion?

1287
02:18:00,613 --> 02:18:02,615
I accept her champion.

1288
02:18:34,772 --> 02:18:38,693
<i>Paul Atreides
must die...</i>

1289
02:18:40,445 --> 02:18:45,158
<i>for</i> Kwisatz Haderach <i>to rise.</i>

1290
02:18:47,827 --> 02:18:51,539
<i>Don't be frightened.</i>

1291
02:18:51,622 --> 02:18:53,207
<i>Don't resist.</i>

1292
02:18:59,255 --> 02:19:01,215
<i>When you take a life,</i>

1293
02:19:02,133 --> 02:19:04,260
<i>you take your own.</i>

1294
02:19:36,042 --> 02:19:38,503
I don't believe
you're the <i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>

1295
02:19:40,004 --> 02:19:42,048
But I want you
to die with honor.

1296
02:19:53,518 --> 02:19:56,354
This crysknife was given to me
by my great aunt.

1297
02:19:59,607 --> 02:20:01,984
It's made
from a tooth of <i>Shai-Hulud.</i>

1298
02:20:02,068 --> 02:20:03,778
The great sandworm.

1299
02:20:05,405 --> 02:20:08,199
This will be a great honor,
for you to die holding it.

1300
02:20:12,495 --> 02:20:14,872
Where is the Outworlder?

1301
02:20:19,210 --> 02:20:21,129
Jamis is a good fighter.

1302
02:20:22,088 --> 02:20:23,756
He won't let you suffer.

1303
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:26,843
Chani...

1304
02:20:29,971 --> 02:20:31,013
Um...

1305
02:20:39,063 --> 02:20:40,273
Never mind.

1306
02:21:35,620 --> 02:21:37,788
May thy knife
chip and shatter.

1307
02:21:45,588 --> 02:21:47,548
You should welcome my blade.

1308
02:21:51,052 --> 02:21:52,803
This world will kill you.

1309
02:21:56,182 --> 02:21:57,725
Quicker this way.

1310
02:22:37,348 --> 02:22:38,975
Do you yield?

1311
02:22:41,227 --> 02:22:43,104
The boy doesn't know our rule.

1312
02:22:44,522 --> 02:22:46,107
There's no yielding
under the amtal rule.

1313
02:22:46,190 --> 02:22:47,858
Only death is the test of it.

1314
02:22:56,284 --> 02:22:58,202
- Is he toying with him?
- No.

1315
02:22:59,537 --> 02:23:01,205
Paul has never killed a man.

1316
02:23:11,966 --> 02:23:16,387
Kwisatz Haderach.

1317
02:23:19,432 --> 02:23:22,476
Kwisatz Haderach.

1318
02:23:22,560 --> 02:23:26,439
<i>Climb up. Rise.</i>

1319
02:25:18,843 --> 02:25:20,761
You're one of us now.

1320
02:25:20,845 --> 02:25:22,680
A life for a life.

1321
02:25:22,763 --> 02:25:24,807
Come with us to <i>Sietch</i> Tabr.

1322
02:25:24,890 --> 02:25:25,933
No.

1323
02:25:26,016 --> 02:25:27,560
Paul needs to get off-world.

1324
02:25:27,643 --> 02:25:29,729
You must have ways.
You have smugglers,

1325
02:25:29,812 --> 02:25:31,063
you have ships.

1326
02:25:31,147 --> 02:25:33,274
- No.
- You have...

1327
02:25:33,357 --> 02:25:35,443
The Emperor sent us
to this place.

1328
02:25:36,861 --> 02:25:38,612
And my father came,

1329
02:25:39,530 --> 02:25:41,824
not for spice,

1330
02:25:41,907 --> 02:25:44,201
not for the riches,

1331
02:25:44,285 --> 02:25:46,412
but for the strength
of your people.

1332
02:25:49,415 --> 02:25:51,500
My road leads into the desert.

1333
02:25:54,170 --> 02:25:55,546
I can see it.

1334
02:25:58,048 --> 02:25:59,675
If you'll have us,

1335
02:26:00,593 --> 02:26:02,178
we will come.

1336
02:26:50,810 --> 02:26:52,311
Desert power.

1337
02:26:53,604 --> 02:26:55,314
This is only the beginning.
