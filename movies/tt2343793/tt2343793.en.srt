2
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,650
Watch me.

3
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,327
Fuck!

4
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,415
What?

5
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,600
<i>We're here to look at a sofa.</i>

6
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,444
You're an hour late.

7
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,975
That's really good advice, Mom.

8
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,002
If I'll have the locks
changed right away.

9
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,404
Any more marital advice?

10
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,935
Fuck!

11
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,091
I don't feel too good
about this.

12
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,375
Janice, just tell him
I got the package.

13
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,481
And he didn't understand?

14
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,280
That little man has
the brain of a squid.

15
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,615
Tell him the thing
that he wants, I got.

16
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,455
See if he can decode that.

17
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,169
Yes, the designs, Janice.

18
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,169
Yes, I have the fucking designs.

19
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,171
Why don't we just skywrite
this conversation?

20
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,003
Yeah, and get me a flight out
of here as soon as possible.

21
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,205
Why the hell would I want to stay?
Have you been to Italy?

22
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,175
Baron Hotel, please.

23
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,531
Hotel Barone?

24
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,566
Hotel Barone. Stunning
how you translated that.

25
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,928
Sorry, miss.
Parisian drivers.

26
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,175
The worst.

27
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,721
She's here.

28
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,055
Do you want me to reschedule?

29
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,375
I am so sorry I'm late.

30
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,455
The one day they cancel
the express train.

31
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,655
I have to be in court, Julia.

32
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,761
I thought we talked about this.

33
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,645
No, I know, I know, I know, but
this really wasn't my fault.

34
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,480
I spoke to the judge, he agreed to
a second psychiatric assessment.

35
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,895
That shrink hated me
before I even walked in.

36
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,775
Well, let's make a better
impression this time,

37
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,484
because his statement
was really damaging.

38
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,001
But did anyone even look
at the report?

39
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,935
Come on, it was an accident.

40
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,055
How many kids have died
because of dry-cleaning bags?

41
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,764
I saved his life.

42
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,055
Julia, you failed
the lie detector test.

43
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,055
I'm the one that
insisted on doing it!

44
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,655
And I told you
it was a bad idea.

45
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,735
Come on, you have
to understand...

46
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,815
No, no, no, it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

47
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,968
Right now, we just need
to convince the judge

48
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,375
that you're stable enough
to get visitation again.

49
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,655
Really?
What's the hurry?

50
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,011
It's only been 12 months.

51
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,975
You haven't really
been helping yourself.

52
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,055
Did you get a job?

53
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,975
I've had half a dozen jobs.

54
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,684
One that you keep
for more than a week.

55
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,290
We need a positive report.

56
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,761
Gina will give you the address.
4:00 tomorrow.

57
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,935
You know, that's great.
Let me...

58
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,725
Let me ask to leave early the
first week of a brand-new job.

59
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,444
Just use that
pretty smile of yours.

60
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,684
It's gonna be okay. Okay.

61
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,527
I'm leaving. Relax.

62
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,805
Okay?

63
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,806
Come here.
Give me your hand.

64
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,735
Yeah?

65
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,095
Yuck!

66
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,975
What? Don't say that.
This is Daddy's work.

67
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,240
Yuck!

68
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,570
This is how we do it.

69
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,135
Daddy paints with his hands.

70
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,815
I don't like it.

71
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,175
Just give it a try.

72
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,725
I want it off!

73
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,695
You'll take it off
on the canvas, okay?

74
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,370
Don't want to.
Just try.

75
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,450
Wipe it off!

76
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,015
Here, just wipe it
on the canvas,

77
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,655
and then it'll be
a painting. Okay?

78
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,808
Now, go ahead.

79
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,645
Jesse!

80
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,884
Here, wipe it off.

81
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,491
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

82
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,326
Yuck.

83
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,607
<i>Bar Americano.</i>

84
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,330
How you doing?

85
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,415
You speak English?

86
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,010
No English, no.

87
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,010
No English.

88
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,205
Bar Americano,
you don't speak English?

89
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,162
So, you got a hamburger?

90
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,855
No hamburger, no.

91
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,015
No hamburger.

92
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,255
You understand the term "irony"?

93
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,169
Nothing.

94
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,331
Is it too much to
expect a Budweiser?

95
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,041
Beero?

96
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,695
<i>Birra.</i>

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,935

<i>Birra.
Birra.</i>

99
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,885
Thank you.

100
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,601
Beero.

101
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,646
Yeah. And make it warm.
Thank you.

102
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,535
<i>Bar Americano.</i>

103
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,935
<i>Bar Americano.</i>

104
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,730
Ready, miss?

105
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,884
<i>Bonjour, mademoiselle.
Bonjour.</i>

106
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,724
Anna Barr.

107
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,168
- Yeah?
<i>- Miss Barr is here.</i>

108
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,815
Does she appear to be armed?

109
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,375
<i>I don't understand, sir.</i>

110
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,085
Humor, which apparently doesn't
travel more than one floor.

111
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,567
Send her up, please.
Thank you.

112
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,289
You really had to
fly me here on points?

113
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,775
Do you want to read it?

114
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,165
Do I want to read
your short story?

115
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,044
Submissions are due Friday.

116
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,855
You're not gonna
offer me a glass?

117
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,895
And watch it turn to vinegar?
I don't think so.

118
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,524
Drop it anywhere.
I'll get back to you.

119
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,335
You want me to leave after I
just flew all the way here?

120
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,170
On points. If I cared,
I would have paid cash.

121
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,615
You don't even want to have sex?

122
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,007
No. But I appreciate
the offer.

123
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,091
You know that just made me wet.

124
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,651
Sadly, yes.

125
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,891
Okay.

126
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,615
Quite the suite.
Isn't it?

127
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,015
Have you had many women here?

128
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,815
The requisite amount.

129
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,175
A writer needs his muses.

130
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,455
He can never get enough of them.

131
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,295
That I know.

132
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,815
When can I expect those notes?

133
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,241
Um, I'll get back to you.

134
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,131
Great.

135
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,843
Nice seeing you, too.

136
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,375
Come here.

137
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,215
This isn't really
mentorly behavior!

138
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,975
Excuse me?

139
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,161
You want something?

140
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,855
Yeah, I do, actually.

141
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,450
One of those.

142
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,526
You mind telling me
what that is?

143
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,006
This? Yeah. If it's cold.

144
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,329
That's good.

145
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,928
I'm sorry for staring.

146
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,884
Staring.

147
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,805
Looking at you.

148
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,441
With my eyes.

149
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,125
You think I'm too stupid to speak English?

150
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,127
Just apologizing for looking.

151
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,245
It's okay.

152
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,441
You're just looking
at my limoncello.

153
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,211
It's very hard not to.

154

<i>Bar Americano.</i>

155
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,135
I can't keep talking.
I'm almost out of minutes.

156
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,288
Yeah, laugh.
It's hysterical.

157
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,366
I'm in a basement.

158
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,330
Excuse me.
A basement!

00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,615
You... Can't what?

00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,735
- Hi.
- Hi.

161
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,843
Are you seriously canceling on me again?
Hi, honey.

162
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,895
You can't be on the phone at work.
I know. Just...

163
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,410
Just one minute.
What about Sunday?

164
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,280
You know what? Just forget about it.
I got to go.

165
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,295
I'm really sorry.
I have no friends left.

166

They either think
I'm a Child killer

167
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,683
or are sick of hearing me
talk about it.

168
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,091
You sure you want to do this?

169
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,255
Are you kidding me?

170
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,805
I can't even pay my bills.

171
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,095
He makes me quit my job, and
now that nobody will hire me,

172
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,175
he fully cuts off my support.

173
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,804
I know lots of people in retail.

174
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,849
Any of them would
give you a job.

175
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,775
Let me put you at the front desk.
No, no.

176
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,371
You're very sweet. I just
want to be invisible.

177
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,528
And nobody looks at maids.

178
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,404
I know I never did.

179
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,455
Okay.
Thank you.

180
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,527
Get changed.

181
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,975
I'll have someone
show you the ropes.

182
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,295
Gerry, you are
a lifesaver, seriously.

183
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,975
Least I could do.

184
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,968
Uniform.
Okay.

185
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,002
Thank you. Okay.

186
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,004
Excuse me.

187
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,481
<i>Sousa</i> me. Another.

188
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,001
<i>Spasibo.</i>

189
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,284
And one for the lady.

190
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,886
<i>Si, grazie.</i>

191
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,645
Finally found something I like
about this country.

192
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,609
You going on vacation?

193
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,606
Taking a train?

194
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,682
You know, that's alcohol.

195
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,081
I'm starting to become aware of that.

196
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,695
<i>Hi, Daddy.
It's me, Megan.</i>

197
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,961
<i>Mommy said we could turn the
heater on for the pool,</i>

198
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,775
<i>but I had to ask you.</i>

199
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,007
<i>Can we?
Please? Please?</i>

200
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,095
<i>I miss you.</i>

201
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,095
<i>And I'm sorry I didn't feed
Choo-Choo, Dad. I love you.</i>

202
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,088
My daughter.
<i>And that's it.</i>

203
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,606
<i>Bye.</i>

204
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,520
<i>Recorded one...</i>

205
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,365
How old?

206
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,170
Seven.

207
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,250
You have kids?

208
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,655
A boy.

209
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,886
Girl?

210
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,810
Girl.

211
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,205
Eight.

212
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,681
Megan.

213
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,175
Beautiful.

214
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,520
She's cute, right?

215
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,963
Thank you.

216
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,804
Nina.

217
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,167
I don't see her two years.

218
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,802
I'm sorry.
That sucks.

219
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,448
Tomorrow I see her.

220
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,010
Great.

221
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,655
Yes.
That's great.

222
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,160
Well... cheers.

223
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,724
To your daughter.

224
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,881
To your.

225
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,530
And to yours.

226
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,135
Hello?

227
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,526
No.

228
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,010
Hello? Hello?

229
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,369
Everything all right?

230
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,845
Miss?

231
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,247
Ma'am?

232
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,690
Thank you.

233
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,095
<i>Bar Americano.</i>

234
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,815
Hey.

235
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,444
Another-o.

236
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,890
I'm not the one
with the Pulitzer Prize,

237
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,215
but I thought one kept a journal

238
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,083
in order to understand oneself.

239
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,570
Why? You thinking
of keeping one?

240
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,375
No. I just don't
understand why

241
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,655
you call yourself "He."

242
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,815
"He" thought this.
"She" said that.

243
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,735
Hey. You shouldn't
be reading that.

244
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,923
You don't want me to know
how much you missed me?

245
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,575
How's the book coming along?

246
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,815
Not a subject for conversation.

247
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,255
You want to read mine?

248
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,295
Not just at this moment.

249
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,563
It's short, all you have to
do is say it's brilliant.

250
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,408
Already erased your
texts from other women?

251
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,887
Takes up most of my day.

252
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,970
So, what do you
want to talk about?

253
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,971
Your inability
to see the obvious.

254
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,615
Your assistant has good taste.

255
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,449
I fired her months ago.

256
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,081
She suggested blue,
she had to go.

257
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,845
It's nice.

258
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,851
I can exchange it.

259
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,923
No, I'll find someone
to give it to.

260
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,731
She may have something
for him, too.

261
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,295
She's just waiting
to see if he deserves it.

262
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,288
He doesn't.

263
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,370
He might.

264
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,255
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

265
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,815
Excuse me, excuse me,
<i>scusa</i> me, <i>scusi.</i>

266
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,895
Hey, she left this.
<i>Che?</i>

267
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,605
She left this. The
woman, she left her bag.

268
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,405
The woman.

269
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,695
A what?

270
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,205
It's not a... <i>bomba.</i>

271
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,090
It's not a <i>bomba,</i> it's a...

272
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,200
Will you tell him... Tell
him that it's not a bomb.

273
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,169
It's not a bomb.
No, no, no.

274
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,895
Whoa. Hey.

275
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,575
<i>Bar Americano.</i>

276
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,929
Jesus Christ.

277
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,095
Hey, mister! Mister,
you must leave it.

278
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,451
You must leave it.
It's a bomb.

279
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,655
It's not a bomb.
You listen.

280
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,887
Listen to me, listen to me.
It's <i>a bomba.</i>

281
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,685
It's not a <i>bomba.</i>
It's not a <i>bomba.</i>

282
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,484
It's a bag with a monkey.

283
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,683
Who puts a monkey on a bomb?

284
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,735
No, no, no, it's a bomb,
it's a bomb, it's a bomb.

285
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,364
It's not a bomb.
It's not a bomb.

286
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,891
It's children's clothing.

287
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,615
Children's clothing, see?
See for yourself.

288
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,083
What'd he say? He say it
could be a shoe bomb.

289
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,282
A shoe bomb?
It's not a shoe bomb.

290
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
Does this look like a shoe bomb?

291
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,480
Why do you guys always make
it a soap opera? Look.

292
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,695
Take this, okay?

293
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,655
If she comes back, you
give her the bag, okay?

294
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,170
It's not a <i>bomba.</i>

295
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,411
So, when do you
think you'll read it?

296
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,487
God!
You are relentless.

297
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,735
I know it's good.

298
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,764
I just need to know if older
readers will understand it.

299
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,815
Why don't you want
to tell me about yours?

300
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,171
Because I think it might stink.

301
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,244
God, you like to suffer.

302
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,095
Jake's reading
the first few chapters,

303
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,415
so I guess he'll
tell me soon enough.

304
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,125
You have a Pulitzer,
it doesn't stink.

305
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,135
You haven't read it.

306
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,208
Do you want me to?
No way.

307
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,495
Then shut up.
You're brilliant.

308
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,335
It's the only reason
I'm with you.

309
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,204
So, you are with me?

310
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,045
You don't even want to
tell me what it's about?

311
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,888
It's...

312
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,935
It's supposed to be about a man

313
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,095
who can only feel through
the characters he creates.

314
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,895
You should be able to write
the hell out of that.

315
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,855
But it keeps trying
to be something else.

316
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,975
What?

317
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,650
I don't know.
I don't know.

318
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,729
Hence the problem.

319
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,690
You should be writing about me.
Are you?

320
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,855
I write about what I know.

321
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,295
And you know me.

322
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,055
And I fictionalize what
I can't comprehend.

323
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,082
That's a lot of fiction.

324
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,563
So, it's not about me?

325
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,575
You know, if I don't find
a use for you soon,

326
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,895
I'm gonna have
to get rid of you.

327
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,015
You've been saying that
for the last two years.

328
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,055
Isn't gonna happen.

329
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,684
Really? Watch me.

330
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,771
Stop.

331
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,246
What?

332
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,815
You're smiling again.

333
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,569
I wouldn't do that.
Someone might see.

334
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,884
Hey! Come on.

335
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,681
Fold, lift and tuck, okay?

336
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,962
Got it.
Just do the list.

337
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,531
Soap, shampoo, notepaper.

338
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,367
All on the list.

339
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,049
So, you're an actress?

340
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,615
You study for movie?

341
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,495
Actress? No.

342
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,329
Well, I used to be.

343
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,766
Um...

344
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,215
I was in a soap opera.

345
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,375
No shit.

346
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,401
Yeah, yeah.

347
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,455
I got the job 'cause
I could cry on cue.

348
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,404
So, you are movie star.
No.

349
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,015
Yeah. Why you stop?

350
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,690
To have a baby.

351
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,167
A man got you pregnant.

352
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,207
Yeah.

353
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,441
They always do.

354
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,761
Yeah.

355
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,975
Housekeeping.

356
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,335
Whoa, whoa, what's going on?
What's going on?

357
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,203
I had 5,000 euros in this bag.

358
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,495
I tell you, it was in here!

359
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,335
What did you say?
What did he say?

360
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,495
What? You had my bag?

361
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,695
For two seconds.

362
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,040
I found it,
I was looking for you.

363
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,695
Out. And you,
too, out!

364
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,775
Now you speak English.

365
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,335
Don't make me call police, okay?

366
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,695
Give me my money,
I go, no problem.

367
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,760
Fucking <i>zingara.</i> You call
me thief in my restaurant?

368
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,609
No, you call this restaurant?

369
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,935
Cockroaches refuse to eat here!
Everybody calm down.

370
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,735
Give me my money!
Take it easy.

371
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,895
Don't you touch me!

372
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,375
Don't touch me, <i>stronzo!</i>

373
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,495
You know the meaning
of the word "asshole"?

374
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,726
Asshole!

375
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,726
Are you all right?

376
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,845
The guy's a jerk.

377
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,042
Miss, miss, the train
station's the other way.

378
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,575
You need money for a ticket?

379
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,921
You want to help,
go get my money?

380
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,295
Look, I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have left the bag.

381
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,606
Or steal my money!

382
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,963
Lady, if I stole your money,
why would I come back?

383
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,015
You know, it's my
daughter's money.

384
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,361
Ask her to forgive you, not me!

385
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,255
All right, let's go back right
now and call the police, okay?

386
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,535
Call the police and they're
going to believe me?

387
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,721
Leave me alone!

388
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,690
Miss. Miss.

389
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,135
Are you trying to kill me off?

390
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,049
I'm gonna take a nap.
I'll see you later.

391
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,486
Wrong floor.

392
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,166
Anna.

393
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,686
You took your own room?

394
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,535
Now you're gonna start on that.

395
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,775
Is nothing good enough for you?

396
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,529
I thought you came here
to spend the week with me.

397
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,449
Did I say in the same room?

398
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,655
Enough people are
talking about us already.

399
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,095
If you don't want
to be seen with me,

400
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,255
why did we just go to the
best restaurant in town?

401
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,255
Please, that is not
the best restaurant.

402
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,415
God!

403
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,935
Listen, I have a reputation.

404
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,375
I know you don't
care about that,

405
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,846
but it means something to me.

406
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,641
Anna.

407
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,455
I'm sorry.

408
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,723
You say that word
so often it has no meaning.

409
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,851
Fuck.

410
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,322
Sure you don't want one?

411
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,649
It's really very good.

412
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,601
The money was for your daughter?

413
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,202
What did she need it for?

414
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,648
Somebody put her on the boat.

415
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,524
It was 5,000 euros.

416
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,246
To get her off the boat
is 5,000 more.

417
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,015
Why a boat?
I'm not...

418
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,930
I mean, can't you just
drive from Romania?

419
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,170
Romania? You see,
you know everything.

420
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,322
Well, what happens now?

421
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,529
Where's her father?

422
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,135
You know, you are not an
easy woman to get to know.

423
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,335
No, you...

424
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,805
You are my new best friend.

425
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,002
What if I can get you the money?

426
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,208
I'm not worth 5,000 euros.

427
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,375
Did I say I wanted to fuck you?

428
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,323
You have nice suit for priest.

429
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,326
And you don't look
like a whore to me.

430
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,895
I'm sorry, <i>signore.</i>

431
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,400
We have no more rooms.
Very busy.

432
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,375
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

433
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,295
They have rooms,
but not for me, okay?

434
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,855
It's okay. You know,
you can have my bed.

435
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,530
I'll sleep in a chair.

436
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,290
For how long?

437
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,968
What do you mean?
All night.

438
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,088
No, I go sleep in station.

439
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,090
What...

440
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,002
You must need sex very badly.

441
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,055
Watch me.

442
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,925
Watch you what, buddy?

443
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,095
Hi.
Hey.

444
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,935
I'm afraid I took
your robe earlier.

445
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,610
You did.
I'm afraid.

446
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,042
So, you've come to return it?

447
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,615
Well, yeah.
I felt bad.

448
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,244
I mean, I thought you might
need it in the morning.

449
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,368
Well, there's two.
There are?

450
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,567
Yeah.

451
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,330
Now I feel foolish.

452
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,606
But it might be damp.

453
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,163
I showered earlier.

454
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,285
So, you do need this one?

455
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,450
Couldn't hurt.

456
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,486
Pick it up.

457
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,284
Hand it to me.

458
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,411
Wow.

459
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,964
Thank you.
Wait...

460
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,565
Open the door!

461
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,200
Sorry. Tired.
Comes with age.

462
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,526
You...

463
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,765
You have my key.

464
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,721
Key?

465
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,730
It's in the pocket.

466
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,127
You are such an asshole.

467
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,961
<i>It's me.
You're probably asleep.</i>

468
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,247
<i>I'll try the...</i>

469
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,964
<i>Message deleted.</i>

470
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,881
Hello?

471
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,055
Gina's apartment flooded,

472
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,923
and I have to be at a
deposition in 20 minutes.

473
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,575
So, what's wrong?
Other than that?

474
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,135
Dr. Gertner had to change
the meeting to her office.

475
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,215
I'm gonna text you the address.

476
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,242
No, no, no, no, I'm
almost out of minutes.

477
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,644
I don't know what that means.

478
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,055
It means I'm on a prepaid phone

479
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,135
and I'm almost out of minutes.

480
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,840
Besides, I'm not even
supposed to be on it.

481
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,047
Seriously?

482
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,526
Okay, write this down.

483
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,210
Wait. Okay.

484
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,935
Okay.

485
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,928
<i>221 East 70th Street.</i>

486
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,560
Got it?

487
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,251
I got to go.

488
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,042
Shit!
I'm so sorry.

489
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,815
God!

490
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,735
You know what, I'll just... I'll
come back when you're done.

491
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,125
I'm so sorry.

492
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,815
Want some?

493
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,887
That bad, was it?

494
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,284
You really want to hear what
I have to say?

495
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,135
Okay. It's well-crafted.
Your structure's clever.

496
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,731
Ooh, clever.

497
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,649
You don't want to hear this?
No, I...

498
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,686
Please.

499
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,887
I guess I wish you'd written
about something more personal.

500
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,641
I mean, this is beautiful.
It is, but cold.

501
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,442
Surprisingly what you
always say about me.

502
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,255
I knew this was a mistake.

503
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,495
No, I can take criticism. I hear
it from my editor every day.

504
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,488
You're a party reporter,
for Christ's sake.

505
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,775
I comment on society.

506
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,450
Well, then I am wrong,
because this is absolutely

507
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,440
up to the literary standards of <i>Women's
Wear Daily.</i>

508
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,247
It's Elaine, I have to take it.

509
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,521
Hi.

510
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,884
I lost my phone.

511
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,691
That's a drag.

512
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,731
Yeah, it's the worst thing
that's happened all month.

513
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,727
<i>I had all of
Robbie's pictures on it.</i>

514
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,855
And I know you told me to
put them on my computer,

515
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,166
but I just didn't do it.

516
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,761
I'm sorry.

517
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,528
I went to the store. They
gave me a new number.

518
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,284
You could have kept
your old number.

519
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,286
Do you want the number?

520
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,284
Yeah, give me a Sec.
I'll put it in my phone.

521
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,529
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

522
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,201
Got it.

523
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,364
I miss you, Michael.

524
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,845
I'm sorry.

525
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,245
It's not your fault.
You're a romantic.

526
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,081
You love love.

527
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,295
<i>It's people you
don't have time for.</i>

528
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,367
Listen...

529
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,169
<i>So, how's the writing?</i>

530
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,925
So good you wouldn't believe.

531
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,931
Sorry.

532
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,290
Is she there?

533
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,885
No.

534
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,721
<i>Would you tell me if she were?</i>

535
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,771
She's not.

536
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,047
Okay. I'll talk
to you later.

537
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,529
Okay.

538
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,767
She having one of those days?

539
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,415
Don't talk about what
you don't understand.

540
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,295
I'm sorry.
I'm being insensitive.

541
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,375
I'm the one who just took
a call from my spouse

542
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,004
while I was with my lover.

543
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,005
That was stupid, I'm sorry.

544
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,328
That's the most overused
word in your vocabulary.

545
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,847
Anna, I really need you
to stop attacking me.

546
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,880
If you needed that,
you wouldn't be with me.

547
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,407
I left her.

548
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,731
Two weeks ago.

549
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,321
What did you tell her?

550
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,215
That I had fallen in love
with someone else.

551
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,969
What, me?

552
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,486
You love me?

553
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,880
I thought you loved her. That's
what you've always said.

554
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,655
I do.

555
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,295
So, this is the way you
treat someone you love?

556
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,815
You don't even know
what the word means.

557
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,966
Anna.
Don't touch me.

558
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,001
Do you think I care?

559
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,885
Do you think I could ever love
someone as deceitful as you?

560
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,046
No, fuck you.

561
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,361
This was not the deal.

562
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,160
Now you're gonna go and find
someone and fuck around on me.

563
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,641
Stop this. Did you
tell her who I was?

564
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,361
Did you?

565
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,760
No!

566
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,604
I'm going to my room.
Thanks for the notes.

567
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,655
303 just called
for housekeeping.

568
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,444
They had a "Do not disturb" on.

569
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,562
Welcome to show business.

570
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,285
Where'd you get a car?

571
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,521
They just counted it.

572
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,495
Thank you.

573
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,521
You're welcome.

574
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,135
You're not giving it to me?

575
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,050
I'm giving it to you,
but I have to go with you.

576
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,491
That wasn't the deal.

577
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,451
There was no deal.

578
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,575
There was no deal,
I'm giving you my money.

579
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,011
No, you want it back.

580
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,615
No, I want to make sure
that you get there with it.

581
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,135
And you're going to protect me?

582
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,969
Like you did in bar?

583
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,568
These are danger people.

584
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,770
So, you shouldn't
be going alone.

585
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,295
Hey, you can't drive through here.

586
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,287
Watch me.

587
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,051
- Get out of the way! Jesus H.
- Christ!

588
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,328
Watch out. Move, move, move.

589
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,135
<i>You have
reached the law offices...</i>

590
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,400
Excuse me.

591
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,449
Housekeeping!

592
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,006
Hello?

593
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,840
$10 phone card.

594
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,491
No $10, $20.

595
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,841
Excuse me.

596
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,095
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

597
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,415
Hey, look, I lost the address.

598
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,055
70th and what? Just call me back.
I'm on my way.

599
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,015
Thank you for your time.

600
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,929
You're very welcome.

601
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,365
She's late.

602
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,924
Unbelievable.

603
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,883
Well, should we go?

604
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,161
No.

605
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,691
Let's wait.

606
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,975
Jake, I'm so sorry, man. I
don't know where my head was.

607
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,375
No, you know what, I'm sorry.

608
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,811
I have this thing in 20 minutes.

609
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,335
Fucking book fairs. I end
up eating six times a day.

610
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,522
So, how's Elaine?

611
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,205
She's good, good.
Good.

612
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,895
Amazing woman.

613
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,207
How she's coping,
I'll never know.

614
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,211
And Anna?

615
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,735
She would die
that you're asking.

616
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,331
She thinks
nobody knows about us.

617
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,048
Women have the incredible gift of
being able to deny any reality.

618
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,655
Listen, I was going
to call you anyway

619
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,215
and tell you not
to read those pages.

620
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,415
You know what, I finished
them on the plane.

621
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,885
I couldn't put them down.

622
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,729
We're not gonna publish it.

623
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,649
I'm, reworking it. I
shouldn't have sent it to you.

624
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,175
You know what,
the writing's great.

625
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,601
I love the characters.
That's not it.

626
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,135
The business has changed
so much, Michael.

627
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,055
I wouldn't know
how to market it.

628
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,242
I don't even recognize
our own house anymore.

629
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,240
I'm selling self-help
cookbooks by reality stars.

630
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,335
Somebody else will print it.

631
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,455
It'll make a fortune.

632
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,164
We'll be jealous as hell.

633
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,800
I really am sorry, Michael.
I do have this thing.

634
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,855
Call me when you're back.

635
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,564
Don't lie to me,
you son of a bitch!

636
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,575
I'm a son of a bitch?

637
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,335
I've known you how long?

638
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,408
How long, Jake? Don't
you dare lie to me.

639
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,611
Okay.

640
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,127
Your first book, stunning.

641
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:36,047
It was cruel and raw.
No pity, no shame.

642
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,455
God, I used to proofread
your galleys sweating,

643
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,845
it was so fucking brave.

644
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,440
Second book less so.

645
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,970
Third, fourth...

646
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,206
Now you have random characters making
various excuses for your life.

647
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,051
Michael, I was frankly
embarrassed to read it.

648
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,808
And I couldn't tell you that.

649
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,491
Wow.

650
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,768
That's...

651
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,963
Give my love to Elaine.

652
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,930
Hello?
You're a half hour late.

653
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,575
I know. I'm almost there.
Where are you?

654
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,807
I told you, 70th and Lex.

655
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,048
Shit.
Where are you?

656
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,521
The West Side!

657
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,255
Get in a cab.

658
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,680
I don't have any money.

659
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,047
What?

660
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,531
I spent it on my phone card.

661
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,735
Listen to me.
Get in a cab now.

662
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,569
Okay? I'll meet
you downstairs.

663
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,566
God! Okay.

664
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,128
Across town, 70th and Lex.

665
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,246
So, where is this place
we're going?

666
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,124
You like that music?

667
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,364
Yeah. Why?

668
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,240
So, this is a friend's car?

669
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,041
You don't have friends?

670
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,964
So, the name of the place?

671
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,560
Or is it just called
"Danger People"?

672
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:57,681
Here!

673
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,569
- Keep the change.
- I'm so, so sorry.

674
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,255
I'm going to the bathroom,

675
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,248
and then I'm going to leave.

676
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,567
Hey. Hey.

677
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,129
I'm sorry, okay?

678
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,375
Look, it's just, you know, you try
and tell people about someone,

679
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,004
and they don't believe you.

680
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,891
This is her.

681
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,966
She doesn't give
a shit about anyone.

682
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,842
All right, we'll go.

683
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,283
I'll pull the car up.

684
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,080
Wait here.

685
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,655
Forty-five minutes is not
late, it's a no-show.

686
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,205
But she had an emergency.

687
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,488
She's here now. And I
have an appointment.

688
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,775
And I did do my
homework, Miss Lowry.

689
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,975
I didn't need to see your client

690
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,495
to know that she fits
the profile of someone

691
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,895
who'd commit this kind of act.

692
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,684
I can't believe this.

693
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,847
You arrogant bitch, you judge
her before even seeing her!

694
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,689
That was her choice.

695
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,206
Good day.

696
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,175
Will she see me?

697
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,884
No. No, she won't.

698
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,455
And if I weren't
working for you,

699
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,255
I wouldn't be here, either.

700
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,567
How could you be so
fucking irresponsible?

701
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,655
I came as soon as I could.
This is not my...

702
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,015
I know it's not your fault.

703
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,295
I don't know what really
happened with your son, Julia...

704
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,855
What? ...but this
should have been

705
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:51,975
the most important thing in your
life, and you weren't here.

706
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,495
And after a second
negative report,

707
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,409
you'll be lucky if you
ever see this kid again.

708
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,328
Maybe he deserves better.

709
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,770
Bye, Julia.

710
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,529
Are you okay?

711
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,329
I'm sorry, what?

712
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,008
Is there anything I can do?

713
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,926
Here.

714
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,844
Thank you.

715
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,609
Do you work here?

716
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,485
No.

717
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:08,083
Do you think it's okay
if I sit here for a while?

718
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,205
Sure.

719
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,163
Do you have any kids?

720
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,165
No.

721
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,484
Are you married?

722
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,690
No.

723
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,324
I have to go.
Yeah.

724
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,371
Yeah.

725
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,609
Someone is waiting.

726
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,450
You're very kind.

727
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,562
I wish you were my friend.

728
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,964
Where are you going?

729
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,890
With you.

730
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,966
<i>Stupido.</i>

731
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,481
I want to dance.

732
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,131
Yes, miss.

733
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,241
Any idea of where
I might do that?

734
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,489
Excuse me.

735
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,451
Hello.

736
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:36,329
Give him the money.

737
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,046
Please.

738
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,882
What do we have?
English?

739
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:43,975
American.

740
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,775
Monika, you have
an American boyfriend.

741
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,086
Congratulations.

742
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,524
I tell you not to come.

743
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,802
American, you have a sister?

744
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,335
Yeah. Yeah.

745
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,408
I'll be sure to bring
her next time.

746
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,290
There you go.

747
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,255
Boyfriend doesn't like me.

748
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,575
He's not my boyfriend.

749
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:05,495
Not your boyfriend, but
he brings me 10,000 euros.

750
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,251
Ten? No, no,
you said five.

751
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,727
Five?
This is Monika.

752
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,815
She tries to pay half price
for her own daughter.

753
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:15,255
Look, I don't know
what's going on here,

754
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,895
but I agreed to five, all right?

755
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,095
I'm not paying 10.

756
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,201
No, you are not.

757
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,920
Ten was the price for her.

758
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:22,975
You are not her.

759
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,126
For you, it's 25.

760
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,575
What? You gotta be kidding.
Where is she?

761
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:28,365
You want to fuck with me some more?
See what happens?

762
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,410
You could not wait in car.

763
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,088
I am happy I'm not you.

764
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,567
Listen, I'm just trying
to help, okay?

765
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,331
That's 5,000 euros.

766
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,721
That's how much I have.

767
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,521
Why don't you take it and get
this girl out of your hair?

768
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,922
That's how much you have?

769
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,929
Even I have more than that.

770
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,687
You two must think I'm an idiot.

771
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,444
See? You see what you did?
Whoa. What I did?

772
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,640
You don't think I know
when I'm being conned?

773
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,855
Fuck you!
Fuck you, American!

774
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,120
Give me my money.

775
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,922
Your money?
Give it to me!

776
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:39,135
This is his phone number.
Did you write that?

777
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,401
Do you know
his number? No.

778
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,644
You stole my money.

779
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,131
Souvenir of Rome.

780
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,167
Fuck. My bags.
Shit.

781
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,210
Hey! My bags!

782
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:32,681
You have bags?

783
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,886
No bags.

784
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:47,521
Hi. Did, Miss Barr...
Yes, sir.

785
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,730
She asked you to give me this?

786
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,201
If you asked.

787
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:02,881
If I asked?

788
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,246
Yes, sir.

789
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,688
And, where is this place?

790
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,086
Want to dance?

791
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,127
Dance?

792
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,481
He has moves.

793
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:46,041
Move, singular.
He has move.

794
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,326
Nice dress, baby.

795
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,444
I have great taste.

796
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,165
Good evening.

797
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,135
Very good. Terrible.
Terrible.

798
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,135
Very good.

799
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,888
<i>I love you.
And that's it. Bye.</i>

800
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,163
<i>Recorded 119 days ago.</i>

801
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,289
<i>To save, press one.</i>

802
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,726
<i>Pronto.</i>

803
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,888
I can get you the money.

804
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,726
<i>Signore?</i>

805
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,735
Yes?
Breakfast in bed?

806
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,603
<i>I can't. Sorry.
I have to run.</i>

807
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,175
Where?

808
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,690
I'm meeting a friend.

809
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,615
So, we'll have lunch, then?

810
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,290
<i>I'm not sure when I'll be back.</i>

811
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,320
Then I'll make reservations
for dinner.

812
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,609
I just said I don't know
when I'll be back.

813
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:32,815
How long are you gone for?

814
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:35,175
I don't know.
I'll text you.

815
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,804
Where the hell are you
going, the Arctic?

816
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:39,129
I can't talk to you
when you're like this.

817
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,615
You want to tell me
what this is about?

818
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,255
Don't be pathetic.
Who are you meeting?

819
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:13,935
A friend.
What, a male friend?

820
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,849
I have a life, my own life.

821
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,855
Anna, everything was great.

822
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,166
Well, then there
isn't a problem.

823
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,489
It's only three floors. Use
the stairs, you lazy bastard.

824
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:26,935
Look, don't do this to yourself.

825
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,095
How sweet.

826
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:29,804
He's trying to
save her from herself.

827
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:31,295
I'm not your fucking child.

828
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,004
Then don't act like one.

829
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,170
That's good.

830
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:38,762
When something cuts too deep, he
reaches for a comforting cliché.

831
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,085
Anna.

832
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,685
Please.

833
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,615
Begging?

834
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,683
Do you know why she chooses
married men, Michael?

835
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:56,895
'Cause she doesn't have to care.

836
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:58,365
They can't hurt her.

837
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,206
And she can leave
whenever she wants.

838
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:05,531
Look at that face.

839
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:09,169
He needs love so badly
until he has it.

840
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,175
Find someone
who doesn't know you.

841
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:13,281
Ciao.

842
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,610
Hey, I'm here.

843
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:07,289
Want to come down and we
get something to eat?

844
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,002
I'm really hungry, though.

845
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,966
Okay. Yeah.
Just for a minute.

846
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:17,281
Okay.

847
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,524
Richie Rich.

848
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,285
Good to see you.
I love that comic book.

849
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,283
And there is
my beautiful Monika.

850
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,055
Are you two fighting?

851
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:44,283
Come, kiss.

852
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,775
Kiss.

853
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,690
Monika's a very good kisser?

854
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,844
Come on, Richie.

855
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,975
Look, feel this. Richie,
come here, feel this.

856
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,855
You have to feel. You have to feel.
Enough.

857
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,609
Hey. Come on. I'm serious.

858
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:03,566
Want to count it?

859
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,648
You don't know
what you're missing.

860
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,011
Where's the girl?

861
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:17,371
The girl.

862
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,041
That's the question.

863
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,048
You meet a woman in a bar.

864
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:30,405
She takes you to a man
who demands money.

865
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:31,931
You give it.

866
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,207
Why?

867
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:41,004
You don't know the woman,
you don't know the man.

868
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,205
She could be lying.

869
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,684
Maybe they both are.

870
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,446
This girl you're paying
for may not even exist.

871
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:55,001
You have to be thinking,
"Is there really a girl?"

872
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,081
So...

873
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:01,607
Why, Richie Rich,
why give me the money?

874
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,246
Where's the girl?

875
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:16,535
You want me to
answer your question,

876
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,528
but you won't answer mine.

877
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,295
Okay.

878
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:24,455
If you can get 25 you can get 50.
No, no, that's it.

879
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,375
No, no, there's not gonna
be a penny more.

880
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,135
We'll see. I can wait.
Where is she?

881
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:29,960
With my friend,
and he's enjoying her company.

882
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:32,255
Hey... hey...

883
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,135
Whoa.

884
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,810
Put the gun down.

885
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,891
Put it down.

886
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:49,405
You hit me, Richie Rich.

887
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,086
All right.

888
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:55,087
You make me look bad
in front of this woman.

889
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,362
Fine. Fine.

890
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,090
Now it's 100.

891
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,922
100, or she's working
the street tomorrow.

892
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,602
She has lips like her mother.

893
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:30,406
Carlo, it's me.
Please.

894
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,123
She's eight years old.

895
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:49,645
What, another friend?

896
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,051
There's my girl.

897
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,290
<i>Bonjour, monsieur.</i>

898
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,575
For my wife.

899
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,441
What are you looking for?

900
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:17,135
No, no, no.
Hey, no, no, no.

901
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,455
Give me the gun.
No.

902
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,811
You want him to kill me?

903
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:21,200
What, so the plan's
to shoot him?

904
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,768
Hey. Why you take my money?

905
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,769
Why? I don't know, I don't know.

906
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,615
I don't know!
I don't know!

907
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,615
It was stupid.
It was stupid.

908
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:32,095
Maybe I wanted to see you again,

909
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:33,575
or save the day or something.

910
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,806
I don't know.

911
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:37,447
It was stupid. Do we always
know why we do things?

912
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:40,530
Or you just wanted my money!
Stop it!

913
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,651
You tell me why you left it there?
You tell me.

914
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:47,561
'Cause nobody forgets something
that important.

915
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:51,162
Come on, you tell me? You
wanted me to take it, didn't you?

916
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:54,215
Where were you,
across the street?

917
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:55,241
Watching?

918
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,448
You wanted me to
feel guilty, is that it?

919
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:01,005
So you could use me?

920
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,602
Because that's what
you do, you use men.

921
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,446
Don't you?
Don't you?

922
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,761
I knew 5,000
wasn't enough, okay?

923
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,335
That I would go to bring her,

924
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,124
he would want more.

925
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,009
Five was all I could save.

926
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:27,175
Carlo hates me.

927
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,725
Maybe he has reasons.

928
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:33,808
But he was the only one
who could bring her to me.

929
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,049
I thought he'd ask 10.

930
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:41,691
Then you saw the suit.

931
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,410
Richie Rich. I don't
know what that means.

932
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,284
It means you thought
I had money.

933
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,495
And you don't?

934
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:49,601
No, I don't.
Not like that.

935
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,604
Look at the label.
It's a fake.

936
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:55,847
I rip off Italian designs, and
I sell them to sweatshops.

937
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,643
Picked the wrong guy.

938
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,568
No. I didn't.

939
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:06,847
I just didn't think Carlo

940
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:08,041
would be so greedy.

941
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:16,406
And I didn't think
you'd hit him.

942
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:21,764
Neither did I.

943
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,444
That was very stupid.

944
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,768
I've done stupider things.

945
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:35,289
Fuck you.
That's my daughter.

946
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,763
She's alone and scared.

947
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:39,681
What would you do?

948
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:44,081
Give me.

949
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,647
Give me the gun.

950
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:56,123
Point this at him,
he will kill you.

951
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:01,886
Declined.

952
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,645
Try again.

953
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:14,961
Declined.

954
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,642
Try again. It's not
going to work.

955
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:23,775
Hey, you can't
walk out with that.

956
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:24,855
Watch me.

957
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:25,881
Hey!

958
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:35,965
<i>Signore. Signore.</i>

959
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,565
Signore has a single room.

960
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:40,001
Yeah, we're together.

961
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,721
Can I ask how long you will be?

962
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,331
How long?

963
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:52,851
We're going to be leaving
tomorrow morning. Together.

964
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,615
And if you have even
the slightest objection,

965
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:58,722
I'll show you exactly how
an American man reacts

966
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:01,200
when you're disrespectful to his wife.

967
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,205
Honey, please.

968
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:09,846
Have a good night.

969
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:11,481
<i>Spasibo.</i>

970
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:32,855
You can sleep on bed.

971
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,406
No, I'm good here.

972
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,883
I won't attack you.

973
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:40,563
How can I be so sure?

974
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,843
Okay.

975
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,684
So, you're a thief?

976
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,369
I'm a businessman.

977
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:23,763
But you steal clothes.

978
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:29,162
Designs. And I don't steal,
I pay people who have...

979
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,415
...advance knowledge.

980
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:33,805
So you're a spy.

981
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:36,601
Yeah.

982
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:38,360
A clothing spy.

983
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:40,406
Yeah.

984
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:43,445
That's too sad.

985
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:47,406
I prefer to think
of you as thiefs.

986
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,807
No one ever
called me that before.

987
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,451
A "thiefs"?

988
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,645
A wife.

989
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:08,168
So, you were gonna
punch him, too?

990
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:10,565
Go to sleep.

991
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,285
Okay.

992
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:05,130
Larry, Larry...

993
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:08,208
Larry, Larry, Larry, stop.

994
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:10,290
Just tell me how much I have.

995
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,764
It's not your money, Larry.
How much?

996
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,685
That's it?

997
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,531
Okay.

998
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:26,731
Send it.

999
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:31,160
Larry, thank you for caring.

1000
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:34,445
Send it.

1001
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:38,931
Okay.

1002
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:48,885
Do you have a bag?

1003
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:42,205
How can you be so weak?

1004
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,088
How? How can you love me?

1005
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:47,375
How?
Please, baby, baby...

1006
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:48,811
How?
Baby...

1007
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:52,887
No, no.
Anna, Anna. Baby.

1008
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:59,575
Okay.

1009
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:04,045
It's okay.

1010
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:09,285
It's okay.

1011
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:18,165
Why does it feel damp?

1012
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:21,255
I can take it back.

1013
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,328
No, no, no, no. I love it.

1014
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:29,450
I can't believe you got
me all those flowers.

1015
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:31,965
Got them on points.

1016
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:34,124
A lot of points.

1017
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,564
Why do you love me?

1018
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,164
I'm so awful to you.

1019
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:44,170
It's your smile.

1020
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,482
I know what that smile costs.

1021
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,162
I don't know what that means.

1022
01:35:57,480 --> 01:36:00,006
You know who I was
with, don't you?

1023
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:03,802
It doesn't matter to me.

1024
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:07,370
But you know.

1025
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:10,610
I don't care.

1026
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,369
I'm gonna ruin it.

1027
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:20,490
I always do, every time
you're good to me.

1028
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:47,695
Aw!

1029
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:49,085
Black, no sugar.

1030
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:52,851
Thank you.

1031
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:57,725
I have to take this.

1032
01:36:58,200 --> 01:36:59,884
No problem.
Sorry.

1033
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:10,091
Hi.

1034
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:11,765
<i>Where did you go?</i>

1035
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,484
I'm sorry. I had to get
back to my friend.

1036
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:17,451
Come back.

1037
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:23,050
I'm with someone.

1038
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:26,082
He's really good to me.

1039
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:28,606
He's gonna hurt you.

1040
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:31,963
No, you don't know him.

1041
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:35,289
I don't have to.
Come back to me.

1042
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:43,688
Can you do something for me?

1043
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,007
Anything.

1044
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:48,175
It's really important.

1045
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:49,486
<i>Anything.</i>

1046
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,535
Will you forgive me?

1047
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:58,086
<i>Baby, none of
this is your fault.</i>

1048
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:00,415
Yes, it is.

1049
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:02,727
<i>You didn't do anything wrong.</i>

1050
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:05,924
You know what I did.

1051
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,764
It's just love.

1052
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:11,611
Come back.

1053
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:18,360
I'm trying to protect you.
You know that, right?

1054
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:24,481
<i>You've been hurt so much. I
can't stand to see you hurt.</i>

1055
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:26,325
I know.

1056
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:30,410
Good-bye, Daddy.

1057
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:18,895
Let's go.

1058
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:22,015
You seem to have an
unending supply of friends.

1059
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:23,055
They're waiting.
Let's go.

1060
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:24,445
They can wait.

1061
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:25,721
Sit.

1062
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:41,004
That's his bike.

1063
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:43,530
Your pal, Carlo.

1064
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,248
So?
He was in Rome.

1065
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:50,124
When?
At the bar.

1066
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:52,165
And outside my hotel.

1067
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:54,206
On that bike.

1068
01:39:55,120 --> 01:39:56,849
You weren't watching your money.

1069
01:39:57,400 --> 01:39:58,526
He was.

1070
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:00,255
You are making
no sense. Let's go.

1071
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:01,805
Really? What is he,
your husband?

1072
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:05,084
The boyfriend?
Your pimp?

1073
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:09,206
What is he?

1074
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:12,961
That's why they're here?
To arrest me?

1075
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:17,923
Policeman, this man
needs you to arrest me.

1076
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:23,170
Do they look like
they understand English?

1077
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:26,495
Play your own games.

1078
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:27,760
Miss. Miss.

1079
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:35,444
You left your bag.

1080
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:40,608
You don't want it?
I'm giving it to you.

1081
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:48,521
You think I'm stupid person?

1082
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:51,727
I take this bag,
they put me in jail.

1083
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:55,803
No. It's yours.

1084
01:40:57,160 --> 01:40:58,730
Take it and go.

1085
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:02,208
Or you can take it
and come with me.

1086
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,809
With you?
Yes.

1087
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:07,167
Where?

1088
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:08,926
Anywhere.

1089
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:13,891
You take me? Knowing
what you think you know?

1090
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:17,645
You have a bag of money.
I'd be a fool not to.

1091
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:21,130
What about my daughter?

1092
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:23,480
Should just leave her?

1093
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:28,606
You think it's
all game, bullshit.

1094
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,170
You don't think she exist.

1095
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,363
I'm gonna believe she does.

1096
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,164
Take it.

1097
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:54,609
Am I Jenna?

1098
01:42:58,600 --> 01:42:59,886
Am I?

1099
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:02,208
He's saying she was
the love of his life.

1100
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:04,455
No, no, no, no, no.
Let me read it.

1101
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:05,575
But when it's done, okay?

1102
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:06,681
When it's done.

1103
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:09,684
But you wrote "the" love.

1104
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:12,375
Yeah.

1105
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:13,447
Of his life.

1106
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:15,965
His entire life.

1107
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:18,175
I'm gonna erase it. No,
no, I'll leave you alone.

1108
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:19,326
I'll leave you alone.

1109
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:21,255
Now, please?
Yeah.

1110
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:22,406
Okay, okay, I'm going.

1111
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:25,329
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1112
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:38,841
Shh.

<i>You have no saved messages.</i>

1114

Hello.

1115

Um, if anyone calls,
I'm moving up to suite 415.

1116
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:56,321
Leary.

1117
01:44:57,440 --> 01:45:01,047
Yeah, and I'm gonna need
some flowers brought up.

1118
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:04,209
Thank you.

1119

Yeah, yeah, but you have
to have it somewhere, right?

1124
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:19,611
I mean, it's not
just gone, right?

1125
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:43,615
No, you have it somewhere.

1126
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:45,175
It's saved somewhere.

1127

No, you have backups.

No! You...

No! No, you're not
fucking sorry!

No!

Hello?

1132
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:04,250
Can I come up, please?

1133
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:07,891
Jesse's not here.

1134
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:10,561
Please.

1135
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:21,240
You can leave it here. I'll
tell him you brought it.

1136
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:28,683
You know that I
would never hurt him.

1137
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:31,090
Right? It's just us here.

1138
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,081
Come on, you know.

1139
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:35,735
What do you want, Julia?

1140
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:37,285
Just tell me that you know.

1141
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:40,415
You hate me,
I cheated on you, but...

1142
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:41,851
I don't care!
Yes, you do.

1143
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:44,441
And it's okay.

1144
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:46,735
But I just need to be able
to see him sometimes.

1145
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:48,364
You see him.
On Skype.

1146
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:53,570
I need to be able to
touch him. He is my son.

1147
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:02,403
I can't, okay? I can't.

1148
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:06,250
Not alone.

1149
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:10,215
Julia, you tried to hurt him.

1150
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:11,366
No, I didn't.

1151
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:13,401
Yes, you did.

1152
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:15,245
You can't admit it, but you did.

1153
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:17,085
What makes you so smart?

1154
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:19,015
You weren't even there.

1155
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:20,775
The police said
that I didn't do it.

1156
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:21,881
No.

1157
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:24,282
They said they didn't have
enough proof to prosecute.

1158
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,006
It's not the same thing.

1159
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:28,926
Child Services would not
have taken Jesse away

1160
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:30,800
if they didn't think that you did it.
Really?

1161
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:33,255
Really? You
don't think it's because

1162
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:35,695
you're rich and
famous and can afford

1163
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:37,484
fancy lawyers and I'm nothing?

1164
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,001
No.

1165
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:41,168
No, that couldn't be it.
No, it could.

1166
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:43,001
Except that I know you.

1167
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:46,690
Come on, I would
never hurt Jesse.

1168
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:49,050
Not when you're yourself.

1169
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:56,441
Look, I just need to
be able to see him.

1170
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,331
Please.

1171
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:08,726
Please.

1172
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:18,447
Okay. Then tell me.

1173
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:23,845
Tell me that you did it.

1174
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:27,689
Why do you get to play God?

1175
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,650
I gave you everything.

1176
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:35,366
I gave up everything
to have him.

1177
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:39,091
Just tell me,
and you can see him.

1178
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:41,884
Not alone, but you can visit.

1179
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:48,205
Just tell me.

1180
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:00,489
Okay. I did it.

1181
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:02,121
No.

1182
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:06,046
You're just saying that
because you want to see him.

1183
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:08,762
I need you to look
at what you did.

1184
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:11,215
I need you to face
what you can't face,

1185
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:12,685
and I need you to
tell me the truth.

1186
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:15,640
I didn't.

1187
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:20,804
Julia, if you don't face
it, you can't change.

1188
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:24,449
And I'll never be
able to trust you.

1189
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:29,845
You need to tell me.

1190
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:33,611
Just tell me.

1191
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:42,840
Say it.

1192
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:51,764
He was in the closet, playing
with dry-cleaning bags.

1193
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:56,015
He was pretending to be a ghost,

1194
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:57,775
and I kept telling him not to,

1195
01:51:57,800 --> 01:51:59,131
but he didn't listen.

1196
01:52:01,120 --> 01:52:02,455
He never listens.

1197
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:03,527
You know that.

1198
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:08,324
But you weren't there.

1199
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:14,764
You were never there,
even when we were together.

1200
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:18,215
It was always just me and him,

1201
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:19,335
and me and him,

1202
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:21,567
and I had to show him
what could happen.

1203
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:28,084
I had to protect him.

1204
01:52:34,760 --> 01:52:36,364
I'm so sorry.

1205
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,525
I'm so sorry.

1206
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:45,120
Okay.

1207
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:48,451
Thank you.

1208
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:56,135
It'll be okay, please.

1209
01:52:56,160 --> 01:52:59,323
Yeah, it'll be okay.
Okay.

1210
01:53:00,840 --> 01:53:02,888
I'm never gonna let
you see him again.

1211
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:06,526
What?

1212
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:08,495
Get out.

1213
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:10,363
No.
Get the fuck out!

1214
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:12,335
No, you said that if I
said that I did it...

1215
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:13,695
Get out!
No, I lied!

1216
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:14,935
Get out!
I just said it because...

1217
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:16,335
Get the fuck out of here!

1218
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:17,775
No! No!
Get out!

1219
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:18,855
No, I lied!
Get out!

1220
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:21,611
I lied! No! No! No! No!

1221
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:57,245
My God. Jesse.

1222
01:53:57,520 --> 01:53:59,055
Jesse, baby!
I told you she did it!

1223
01:53:59,080 --> 01:54:00,735
Jesse, baby, come on!

1224
01:54:00,760 --> 01:54:01,815
Come on! Come on!
I told you she...

1225
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:03,683
Jesse! Jesse!

1226
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:06,815
Jesse! God damn it!

1227
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:42,721
Hey.

1228
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:45,120
You okay?

1229
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:48,926
You all right?

1230
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:53,767
Never do that to me again, okay?

1231
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:57,290
Please?

1232
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:04,846
Theresa Lowry.

1233
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:06,566
Hi.

1234
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:11,484
<i>Thanks for picking up.</i>

1235
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:18,566
I didn't know it was you.

1236
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:22,481
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

1237
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:26,046
I'm fine, Scott.
How are you?

1238
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:31,095
I don't know what to do, Terry.

1239
01:55:31,120 --> 01:55:32,770
I don't know how
to forgive myself.

1240
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,128
Do you know how
long she talked about

1241
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:39,522
showing you how she could swim

1242
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,367
<i>whenever you got back
from wherever you were?</i>

1243
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:43,895
Please don't.

1244
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:45,640
<i>She was always trying
to get your attention.</i>

1245
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,535
All you had to do was watch her,

1246
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:48,735
and you couldn't even do that.

1247
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:50,524
You walked away to
take a phone call.

1248
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:53,564
<i>It was 30 seconds.</i>

1249
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:56,486
She wasn't in the pool.

1250
01:55:58,280 --> 01:55:59,725
I was gone for 30 seconds.

1251
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:04,724
<i>You know, I never asked you,
but did you make that deal?</i>

1252
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:09,170
Did you get that
contract, Scott?

1253
01:56:13,120 --> 01:56:15,043
You keep trying to
forgive yourself.

1254
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:18,371
I never will.

1255
01:56:20,240 --> 01:56:21,480
Okay.

1256
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:36,201
Jesus.

1257
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:39,415
It's a lot of work.

1258
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:40,960
I can have it finished
in three months.

1259
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:50,770
Does she know you're doing this?

1260
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:56,762
People are gonna know it's Anna.

1261
01:56:57,560 --> 01:56:58,895
Six months from now,
she'll be the punchline

1262
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:00,604
at every cocktail
party in New York.

1263
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:03,601
You can do that to her?

1264
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:06,655
It's the weakest story.

1265
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:08,125
It's the strongest choice.

1266
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:19,244
Well?

1267
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:27,926
Okay.

1268
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:45,761
Hi.

1269
01:57:51,640 --> 01:57:53,005
He didn't want this?

1270
01:57:54,160 --> 01:57:55,415
No, it's for you.

1271
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:57,044
He asked me to pour it.

1272
01:57:57,720 --> 01:57:58,846
He did?

1273
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:00,645
Why?

1274
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:03,488
She asked him to
take care of you.

1275
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:05,571
Who did?

1276
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:07,606
In the elevator.

1277
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:10,969
She asked him to
take care of you.

1278
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:12,681
How do you know?

1279
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:15,408
He told me when he
asked for the milk.

1280
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:18,845
Did he say anything else?

1281
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:21,009
Did she say
anything else to him?

1282
01:58:22,360 --> 01:58:23,521
No.

1283
01:58:25,240 --> 01:58:26,810
She didn't say
that she was sorry?

1284
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,240
No.

1285
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:50,487
What are you doing?

1286
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:52,728
Eating the whole
pancake? Yeah?

1287
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:34,695
I'm gonna need another night.

1288
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:36,324
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

1289
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:42,204
You know where I
can buy a shirt?

1290
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:36,091
You have new shirt.

1291
02:00:39,240 --> 02:00:40,480
Yes.

1292
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:42,891
It's nice.

1293
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:45,006
Thank you.

1294
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:49,290
You waited for me.

1295
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,445
Yes.

1296
02:00:55,160 --> 02:00:57,288
I give him the money.

1297
02:01:04,280 --> 02:01:05,884
Will you still take me?

1298
02:01:08,120 --> 02:01:09,849
I don't have anything left.

1299
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:14,411
Will you take me, no questions?

1300
02:01:16,120 --> 02:01:18,122
Just take me.

1301
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:23,444
Yes.

1302
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:26,965
Okay.

1303
02:01:32,680 --> 02:01:34,444
Your daughter?

1304
02:01:36,240 --> 02:01:37,651
Can I meet her?

1305
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:43,120
You are fool to
have believed me.

1306
02:02:57,680 --> 02:02:59,842
<i>Please leave
a message after the tone.</i>

1307
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:02,280
<i>Hey.</i>

1308
02:03:03,560 --> 02:03:04,800
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1309
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:07,644
<i>You can have him
tonight if you like.</i>

1310
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:10,691
<i>Okay.</i>

1311
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:43,166
Hi.

1312
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:44,641
How's Rome?

1313
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:47,481
You know, warm.

1314
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:52,570
I love that tiny apartment
on the piazza.

1315
02:04:54,240 --> 02:04:57,210
So, did you, um,
finish reading it?

1316
02:04:58,840 --> 02:05:00,285
Last night.

1317
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:03,606
It's good.

1318
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:04,966
You're not just saying that?

1319
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:07,201
<i>No.</i>

1320
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:08,920
<i>It's good.</i>

1321
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:10,571
Thanks.

1322
02:05:11,440 --> 02:05:13,568
Must have been hard
for you to read it.

1323
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:15,970
How you live for her smile?

1324
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:19,169
How she's the love of your life?

1325
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:20,611
Why would that bother me?

1326
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:23,455
If I could've trusted
anyone else to read it...

1327
02:05:23,480 --> 02:05:25,130
Stop trying to get
sympathy, Michael.

1328
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:27,215
<i>I'm sure I'll be reading
this conversation</i>

1329
02:05:27,240 --> 02:05:28,241
<i>in the next draft.</i>

1330
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:33,245
You really don't feel
a thing, do you?

1331
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:41,565
Is she there?

1332
02:05:43,160 --> 02:05:44,775
No.

1333
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:46,131
You're lying again.

1334
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:48,326
She left me.

1335
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:50,531
Couple of months ago.

1336
02:05:54,520 --> 02:05:59,401
You told her that you were writing
about her and her father?

1337
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:02,331
No.

1338
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:06,324
She read my journal.

1339
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:15,490
God, Michael.

1340
02:06:20,040 --> 02:06:21,495
I'm cold.

1341
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:23,249
I just came in from a swim.

1342
02:06:24,680 --> 02:06:26,762
I'm glad you're
using the pool again.

1343
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:30,845
You used his name.

1344
02:06:32,360 --> 02:06:33,691
Robbie.

1345
02:06:34,040 --> 02:06:35,929
Yeah, I'm gonna change it.

1346
02:06:36,720 --> 02:06:38,051
<i>Don't.</i>

1347
02:06:38,680 --> 02:06:41,001
It happened in a moment.
It wasn't your fault.

1348
02:06:43,960 --> 02:06:46,201
He just so wanted
to make you proud.

1349
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:51,528
It wasn't a business
call, Elaine.

1350
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:56,646
I lied.

1351
02:06:58,360 --> 02:06:59,691
It wasn't business.

1352
02:07:03,640 --> 02:07:04,926
Who was it?

1353
02:07:10,040 --> 02:07:11,690
God, Michael.

1354
02:07:19,680 --> 02:07:21,489
Does she know it was
her on the phone?

1355
02:07:39,560 --> 02:07:40,846
Come home.

1356
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:43,925
Come home, Michael.

1357
02:07:48,240 --> 02:07:49,571
How?

1358
02:08:00,440 --> 02:08:01,771
Watch me.

1359
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:06,326
I have to go.

1360
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:11,125
Michael.

1361
02:10:03,240 --> 02:10:05,049
Watch me.

1361
02:10:06,305 --> 02:11:06,932
