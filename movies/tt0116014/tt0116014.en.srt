2
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,597
On afull moon night

3
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,634
On the roof of the Forbidden City

4
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,395
A sword from the west

5
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:43,169
Flying fairy

6
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:04,253
You Fa Moon-lau and me, Luk Siu Fung

7
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:07,198
would be so glad to watch
the duel of 2 great swordsmen

8
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,862
Yes. Sai Mun Tsui-suet &
Yip Koo-shing's swords

9
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,236
haven't been shown yet
but we can smell it

10
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:16,265
This sword is made by finest steel

11
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:19,278
its length is 3 feet 3 inches
weight 6 catties and 4 taels

12
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:20,711
This sword is very sharp

13
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,682
Its length is 3 feet 7 inches
weight 7 catties & 1 3 taels

14
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:27,208
Sai Mun Tsui-suet, do you have
confidence to face my stance?

15
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:30,381
Mr. Yip, I'm ready

16
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,229
Fly...

17
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,660
Flying...

18
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:43,636
Fa...

19
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:46,668
Fairy!

20
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:51,538
Who are you?

21
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,274
How dare you fight on the roof top of
the Emperor's house? Tell me your names

22
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:57,006
I'm Yip Koo-shing
Master of the White Cloud Castle

23
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:01,283
Yip Koo-ching?

24
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:07,426
And... I'm a cool swordsman
Sai Mun Tsui-suet

25
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:13,255
And me, Fa Moon-lau, the Blind Superman

26
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:18,396
And me, a lovely hero with
4 eye-brows. Luk Siu-fung!

27
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:23,435
What? Luk Siu-fung?

28
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:28,270
Lovely hero?

29
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,781
You know you're bothering
2 great swordsmen to have their duel?

30
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,842
Who are you?

31
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,513
Secret Agent Ling Ling Fat

32
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:38,251
I'm responsible to protect
His Majesty and his properties

33
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:43,285
Listen, you old folks!

34
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,923
You are charged of breach of close

35
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,398
You're charged of illegal gathering, too

36
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:48,798
And haven't behaved
yourselves in public area

37
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,395
Hey, don't call us old folks!

38
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:53,564
Great swordsmen may not
always be handsome

39
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:57,804
Handsome heroes are just
the expectations of ordinary people

40
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,312
Yes. Heroes will have bald head too

41
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,679
But not as ugly as you are!

42
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,385
Please give us a chance!

43
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,590
This is a precious secret
scroll of Kung-fu

44
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,387
Take it. Uncuff us at once

45
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,394
You want to exchange your freedom
with such poor book? Stop dreaming

46
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,025
Haven't you heard of my name?

47
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,363
Of course not!
You're not that famous. Get lost

48
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:25,633
Young man
better give us face. I'm Sai...

49
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,505
I don't care
I won't give you face, anyway

50
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:31,405
Bastard! You'd respect the blind

51
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,313
Since you're blind, don't climb up!

52
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,111
Or, you'll fall to death, old man

53
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,077
You've gone too far!
Once I attack with my Wonder Fingers...

54
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,454
Wonder Finger? I have one too. Got it?
Better learn it

55
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,321
All of you, on the floor
put your hands on your heads

56
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,387
I think you'll be put to jail
not less than 1 0 years

57
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,955
I won't let you go this time

58
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,466
What a shame!

59
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,661
Pals, let's forget this ignorant guy

60
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,034
Let's choose another day for the fight

61
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,708
So powerful!

62
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:23,279
Members of the Secret Agent

63
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,613
Ling Ling Kung

64
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,583
Ling Ling Hei

65
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,910
Ling Ling Fat

66
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:29,679
Ling Ling Choi

67
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:34,090
We'll be your
Majesty's loyal servants forever

68
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,551
We'll be your
Majesty's loyal servants forever

69
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,593
Iron Clothe!

70
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,769
It breaks Yes...

71
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,698
Great!

72
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,746
Unbreakable Armor

73
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,258
Five Shapes Fists

74
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:52,261
Dragon

75
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:53,801
Snake

76
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:55,971
Tiger

77
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:57,268
Panther

78
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:58,343
Crane

79
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,258
Bravo!

80
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,024
What's up?

81
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,692
These 2 stones are
found in the very North

82
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,993
There are 2 sides, with amazing power

83
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,363
If positive side face the positive side
they'll reject each other

84
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,697
They can't stick together

85
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,169
If the positive side faces the
negative side, they'll stick together

86
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,762
Very amazing!

87
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,966
It's a great discovery

88
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,037
I'd like to devote it to you

89
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,704
What's the use of it?

90
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,808
Girls, you need not sway
the fan so hardly from now on

91
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,321
That two aren't attractive
how about this?

92
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,247
Put these 2 leaves together

93
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,122
and move it with great speed

94
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,720
So strong wind will be created

95
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,499
If the weather is hot
this new product would be wonderful!

96
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,939
Is Your Majesty interested in being
a sole agent of my product?

97
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,807
Your Majesty, I've not given my
subordinates good guidance

98
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:38,901
I'd be blamed!

99
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,879
Ling Ling Fat, behave yourself

100
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,313
I've got a way to
defeat your lron Clothe

101
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,179
Fat-yan

102
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,439
I'm coming

103
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,290
I've discovered that

104
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,487
if I put carbon
Nitre and sulphur in a small space

105
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,086
say, inside one's mouth

106
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,798
And, one tiny steel ball is put in

107
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,835
When an explosion is happened inside

108
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,804
solid becomes gas form
and the expansion creates great power

109
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:07,737
So the steel ball will be pushed out

110
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,798
The power is so great that
it can break stone and metal

111
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,867
Iron clothe will become a mess

112
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,139
What did you say?

113
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,407
Great! Come here

114
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,145
Fat-yan, are you ready?

115
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,381
The only demerit of this weapon is...

116
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,915
high temperature will be caused

117
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,262
So Fat-yan's mouth must be
under series of special training

118
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:35,230
say, eat hot dumplings
as training step no. one

119
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,028
Or, drink very hot soup

120
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:42,205
Now, Fat-yan's mouth can
stand temperature of 1 00oC

121
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:46,135
I tell you, he can eat hot
shark-fin soup faster than anyone else

122
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,304
so, he can eat much more than us

123
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:48,574
But...

124
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:51,280
Kids should not learn this

125
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,522
Make it or not?

126
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:04,794
It's almost successful

127
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,060
I feel that my mouth has had gone

128
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,191
No, it becomes bigger only

129
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,792
How big is it?

130
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,962
Very big, don't worry

131
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,837
It's almost done!

132
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,866
Give me some time to amend it
I think I can...

133
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,968
Shut up!

134
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,003
Please don't get angry

135
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,571
Fat, what are you doing?

136
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:23,741
Doing minor things

137
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,114
I'm asking you, what are you doing?

138
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,479
Just some inventions

139
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,318
Say! What're you doing?

140
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,823
What the hell are you doing?
The Majesty is asking you

141
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,552
What're you doing? Say!

142
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,860
I just want to make new inventions

143
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,194
Come up!
I want you to come up and tell me

144
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,627
Hurry up...

145
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,629
I'm coming soon

146
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,801
If your post wasn't from heritage

147
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,235
I would have fired you!

148
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,034
Now, get lost!

149
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,936
I let you cover yourself
by acting as a doctor

150
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,341
But he chose to be a gynecologist!

151
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,845
What a shame!

152
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,913
You seldom practise Kung-fu

153
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,575
I don't know what you're doing at all

154
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,607
He didn't come for a meeting last night

155
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:00,880
Where were you last night?

156
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,547
I caught thieves on the roof top

157
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:03,486
What thieves?

158
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,855
I caught Yip Koo-shing
Sai Mun Tsui-suet and Luk Siu-fung

159
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,189
Although they escaped

160
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,922
I got a secret scroll of Kung-fu instead

161
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:10,860
What's that?

162
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,960
A stance named Flying Fairy

163
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,556
Have you practised?

164
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,897
Yes, I did a bit

165
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,095
Show me now

166
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,566
This is called Flying Fairy

167
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,201
He is fooling you, Your Majesty

168
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,143
Get up! Now! Quick! Stand right here!

169
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,711
I'm coming... Hurry up...

170
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,083
Don't pretend. Come up...

171
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,643
Coming

172
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,453
Come up! Coming!

173
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,048
Get out now!

174
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,115
I tell you

175
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,627
I don't want to see you again

176
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,686
and hear from you either!

177
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:54,135
Secret agent...

178
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,538
Great!

179
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,510
Great!

180
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,727
Doctor, l...

181
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,231
Let me give you some medicine?

182
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:27,899
Wait, let me tell you my symptoms first

183
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,966
You have to take medicine anyway, right?

184
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,010
Take the medicine

185
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:34,236
Pay now

186
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:35,910
Show her to the door

187
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,677
Doctor, I've come a long way here

188
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,480
Please listen to me first

189
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,010
Come on, please!

190
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,546
I'll let you say anything you like...

191
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,059
on your way home

192
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:48,957
Next

193
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,030
Doctor, I'm sick

194
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:53,361
Let me give you some medicine

195
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,560
My hands and legs are cold
I feel dizzy too

196
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:59,162
Sometimes when I stand up after a squat
I'll feel dizzy

197
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,332
Well, no medicine is needed

198
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,965
Go home and prepare for your funeral

199
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,977
Are you kidding me? Isn't it...

200
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,673
because of woman's period?

201
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,978
Or hormone changed after delivery?

202
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,277
What make you think so?

203
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:17,346
Well, you can tell it
from the color of tongue

204
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,516
Well, how to cure you then?

205
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,521
It's simple

206
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,994
Use 1/2 tael of Tin Nam Sing
0.15 tael of Lily

207
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,497
0.2 tael of To Chow Sing, 0.08 tael
of Si Kwan Chi, one teal of Ha Fu Tsoi

208
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,662
Plus winter flower, cook with light fire

209
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,636
Here they are
boil with eight bowls of water

210
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,006
Drink it, then you'll recover soon

211
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,570
Thank you, doctor

212
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:40,808
Show doctor to the door

213
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,105
Ne...

214
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,315
Next?

215
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,145
Doctor, my heart aches!

216
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,054
Let me give you some medicine

217
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:56,260
My nasty husband has a concubine

218
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,464
He always beats me up!

219
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,469
I've suffered enough! Although
a rude man brings extra excitement

220
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,036
I couldn't stand any more!

221
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,440
Doctor, are you rude?

222
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,707
It depends

223
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,378
Sometimes, I can be rude

224
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:23,051
Alright, my husband fools around
I want to have a secret affair too

225
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,146
Come on!

226
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,251
Let me see how rude are you!

227
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:31,162
Honey!

228
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:32,862
What's the matter, honey?

229
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,569
This lady...

230
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,170
she wants my help

231
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,175
You know, I am a kind-hearted doctor

232
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,667
She comes a long way here
just give her a hand

233
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,247
Miss, are you tired?

234
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,580
Do you want some noodle?

235
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,210
I am fine!

236
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,881
Honey, am I a good husband?

237
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,717
I have arrived, that's why you behaved!

238
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,853
If I am not present
will you accept the temptation?

239
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,523
I swear!

240
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:06,394
I will!

241
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,225
You bastard!

242
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:15,833
Once again
will you take the temptation! Tell me

243
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:16,772
Yes

244
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,139
Great

245
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,119
I am not afraid of it! You nuts!

246
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,662
I will not play with you if you bite!

247
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:38,685
Alright

248
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,342
I surrender! I surrender!

249
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,276
Hands off!

250
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,246
No! Or you will jump over!

251
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,572
I won't! I surrender!

252
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,140
My hand breaks! Honey
hands off me please

253
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,913
I don't believe in you

254
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,517
It really breaks!

255
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,486
Sorry, hubby

256
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,361
You woman!

257
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,231
You are really good at Kung-fu

258
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:26,138
Master is so pleased!

259
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,703
I won't feel unhappy

260
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:30,613
What?

261
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,743
Do you know what's in my mind?

262
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,913
I have present for you

263
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,855
Remember you cut the onion few days ago

264
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,950
you chopped and chopped...

265
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,254
At last, you cut your finger

266
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,287
Now, I will give you this hand

267
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:49,459
So, you can use your
own hand to catch this hand

268
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,469
And use this hand to hold the onion

269
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,198
Even you cut your hand
it'll be a fake hand

270
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,206
Your own hand won't be hurt!

271
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,765
How can you make it?

272
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,371
Thank you, hubby!

273
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,140
Sweetie!

274
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:01,839
Honey!

275
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,676
Sweetie!

276
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:03,578
Honey!

277
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,810
You said, it's tough to clean the floor

278
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:07,750
Yes

279
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,378
Take this pair of shoes

280
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,390
After wearing it
your legs will help you a lot

281
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,448
See, your legs will
become groom & dust pan

282
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:16,256
And you can clean the floor
while you are walking

283
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:17,957
Open your mouth

284
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,862
Put all the rubbish inside your mouth

285
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,431
No!

286
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,301
Wait

287
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,467
How do you feel?

288
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:34,912
Hubby, I think you are a great inventor

289
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:36,509
What else?

290
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,273
And...

291
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,342
I love you very much!

292
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:41,350
So...

293
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:41,852
Let's sleep

294
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,650
But I want to try this!

295
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,847
No, try this

296
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:53,824
It's rat!

297
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,934
This time, I'll use
rat's movement to release power

298
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,733
And it will push the wheel
to increase the power

299
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,500
then, it's powerful enough to move this!

300
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:06,002
It can support weight over 200 catties

301
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,936
How about the steam machine
we used last time?

302
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:13,681
It's good, but when it is dried
it will stop at once

303
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,277
Isn't this better?

304
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:16,510
You are right

305
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,022
But, something is missing

306
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,354
And this is the greatest breakthrough
I've ever made

307
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:23,327
Now, we can choose different grade
of speed for different needs

308
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,351
Look!

309
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,873
Honey, am I wonderful?

310
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:39,910
You are so cheap!

311
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,306
Sure!

312
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,812
Honey, what does that Rear mean?

313
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,317
That's backward!

314
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,374
Let me try

315
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:48,351
No!

316
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,064
Does it work?

317
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:08,869
Sure, I cook with
this super turning shovel

318
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:11,068
Not even a drop of oil can dirty me

319
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:14,772
Sure, but I mean the air system machine!

320
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:15,837
That machine?

321
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,912
Show me once

322
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:29,620
It works, this is effective

323
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,495
And you can take this as practice

324
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,862
Yeah, it's good to health

325
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:34,661
Hubby

326
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,462
Honey

327
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,057
Hubby

328
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:36,624
Honey

329
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:37,396
Hubby

330
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,027
I'll let you play

331
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,128
Great

332
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,685
The one who is like a ghost has arrived

333
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,151
What's wrong with you?

334
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,690
Doctor...

335
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,523
Just between you and me!

336
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:09,557
It's enough for you to disguise as woman

337
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,434
It's not necessary
for you to talk like a woman!

338
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:15,667
Being a member of the
Forbidden City Cops

339
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:20,144
I should try my very best
to cover my identity

340
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:21,972
Better be careful

341
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,610
Doctor...

342
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,653
Am I pregnant?

343
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,383
Yes, eat this for abortion

344
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:34,892
What else do you want to say?

345
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,492
Fat-yan said...

346
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,462
Don't talk like a woman

347
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:39,725
Fat-yan said...

348
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,495
Lie down, don't let me see your face

349
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:47,934
There is an important mission for you
go back to the Headquarters

350
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,463
Better say earlier!

351
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:54,773
Fat, be smart

352
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,947
This important mission is counted on you

353
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,682
We have had banquets
in the headquarters in these nights

354
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:05,080
if you can't clean
all the dishes tonight

355
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,591
you will be put to jail

356
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,662
Here comes His Majesty

357
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,998
I've got a message that
inside the territory of Gum Kingdom

358
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,797
Something mysterious happened last month
that is

359
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:18,461
Oh, really?

360
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,698
a creature called Flying Fairy
fell down from heaven

361
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:23,037
Thus, they called a meeting for
all famous doctors in our country

362
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:25,168
In order to dissect the Flying Fairy

363
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,842
Dissect Flying Fairy?

364
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,881
Under the great leadership
of Your Majesty

365
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:32,179
how come such ridiculous thing happens?

366
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:35,448
I am sure this is
the trick of the cheaters

367
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,148
Do you still want to go?

368
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,657
Only the fool will be cheated!

369
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:41,188
I do want to take a look

370
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:45,491
You know it is ridiculous
but Your Majesty still want to face it

371
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,590
you are so brave, so courageous!

372
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:52,228
Only under the leadership of
such brave and smart emperor

373
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,569
our country will be
prosperous and stable

374
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,006
Long life to Your Majesty

375
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:00,577
The people of Gum Kingdom are
always cunning, it may be a trap

376
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,705
If you go, it may be dangerous

377
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,213
Forget it

378
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:05,807
If you don't finish washing these dishes
you'll be more dangerous

379
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,785
But I have duty to remind Your Majesty

380
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,081
Long life to Your Majesty

381
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,110
Bravo

382
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,487
Kung Hei Choi, you will protect me

383
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:13,491
we will set out tomorrow

384
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:14,082
Yes

385
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:18,995
Long life Your Majesty

386
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,690
Fat, cut the crap

387
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,065
His Majesty doesn't want to hear your voice

388
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:25,592
If you say anything nonsense
your head will be chopped off

389
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:28,265
Wash the dishes. Don't speak up...

390
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,106
Thank God, you are saved!

391
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,015
You wash my dishes

392
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,792
There must be conspiracy!

393
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:51,893
China is stable and prosperous

394
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,290
The beautiful women
are specially beautiful

395
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:57,158
The handsome men are specially handsome

396
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:01,135
I do hope that our flag of Gum Sect

397
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,765
will be found on their soil

398
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:05,208
The Chinese soldiers are poor in health

399
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:09,270
The dissection of Flying Fairy
is to gather the Chinese doctors

400
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:11,214
then, we will launch an attack
to the Chinese troops

401
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,308
Since they have no doctors

402
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:15,148
our troops can march from the
North to South with ease

403
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:19,248
It'll be a piece of cake
for us to conquer China

404
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,569
You bastard, you look like a dummy

405
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:32,797
especially when you smile!

406
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,635
I don't know why
you are so dummy looking!

407
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,067
Stop it!

408
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,668
I am like a dummy whenever I see you

409
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:41,906
When I see daddy
I seem to be more foolish!

410
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,717
Don't you like my look?

411
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:50,812
Your dad ruined his face

412
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,790
because of practising No Face's Stance!

413
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,630
A 2

414
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,870
I four

415
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:13,739
Got it?

416
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:14,972
Bingo

417
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:21,752
D 4 and 7

418
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:25,916
H 2 5

419
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:27,018
Got it?

420
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:29,026
Two Six

421
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,186
Try Two Five again

422
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:31,160
Two Five

423
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,163
Go back to 2 6

424
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,255
2 & 6

425
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:33,855
Got it?

426
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:34,957
Yes

427
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:37,659
Where do you feel itchy?

428
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,665
C 1 3 4 6 8 plus D 1

429
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,204
And, A 2, E 4

430
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,069
Got it?

431
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,145
You are so stupid!
You won't make it like this!

432
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,374
I am stupid, that's why you look smart

433
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:52,406
Please don't say I am smart

434
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:54,375
But your inventions are really wonderful

435
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,818
Who said so?

436
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:56,786
I said it

437
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:57,685
What's your name?

438
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,689
Lau

439
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,781
Who are you?

440
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:00,756
I am your wife

441
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:01,759
Shit!

442
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,251
Come on, don't scold me

443
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,092
You scolded me first

444
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:09,661
You are the only one who praises me
but what's the use of it?

445
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:10,895
I don't care!

446
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,096
I think you are really great

447
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:13,365
You are great, that's why I praise you!

448
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,337
Don't you understand my words?

449
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:15,805
What do you want to say?

450
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,807
Don't you know it?

451
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,331
I have had a difficult job

452
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,367
But you will never know it

453
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,779
I don't know how hard your job is

454
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:26,045
But I believe that
you are doing something good

455
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,881
Just scold whoever offended you

456
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,409
But never blame me as scapegoat

457
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:30,819
Since you are familiar with me

458
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:31,685
That's why I should be blamed?

459
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,088
I tell you!

460
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:33,818
Yes

461
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:34,688
So, you...

462
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,353
You can blame me instead?

463
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:37,452
Yeah!

464
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,787
So what? Why not leave home?

465
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,083
How do you know I am
hiding under the table?

466
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,880
You always hide under the table

467
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,752
That's why I know you must be
hiding under the table

468
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:05,446
Please use your brain to think!

469
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,082
Think a new place to hide!

470
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,854
So, I will have new excitement

471
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:12,056
But if I don't hide under the table
I am afraid you can't find me

472
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,489
I can't stand it any more

473
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:18,195
Please don't! I beg you!

474
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:20,227
Honey, please don't do it again

475
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:23,001
I am a woman only
but you always scold me

476
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,440
I am afraid I can't tolerate it any more

477
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,909
If you can't tolerate it, just leave me

478
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:26,907
I'm going to bath

479
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,776
I ask you to leave me alone!

480
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,206
Are you hungry?

481
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:31,840
I'll do you some noodle

482
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:55,064
Sorry, it's my fault

483
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:57,968
I lose my mind

484
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,177
Forget it

485
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:04,380
But why do you lose your temper?

486
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,880
There is an important medical
meeting held in Gum Kingdom

487
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,888
But I am not qualified to join it

488
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,421
Who said so?

489
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:13,424
I said, you are qualified

490
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,953
I don't mind others disqualifying me

491
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,554
According to what you said

492
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:20,529
I can go now!

493
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,412
Stop!

494
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:50,819
What's the matter?

495
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:53,057
Some woodmen appear in such remote place

496
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,565
be careful of trick!

497
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:56,290
Who are you?

498
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,995
We're woodmen

499
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,869
Don't block my way

500
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,904
I am the Emperor

501
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:05,908
Get lost!

502
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,310
Don't disclose our identities on the way

503
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:14,113
I don't want others to
know I am the Emperor

504
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:15,511
Got it?

505
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:17,546
Yes, Your Majesty

506
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:18,516
Let's go

507
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:20,456
Let's go

508
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:40,472
The leading guy is having
long and soft breath

509
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,503
He must be a Kung-fu
master who is good at Air Stance

510
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,575
The one with whip is having stable steps

511
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,415
He must be a great Kung-fu fighter

512
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,746
And the one, with strong arms

513
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,418
He must be a great Kung-fu fighter too

514
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,860
I think they must be the
famous Forbidden City Cops

515
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,921
Iron Clothe, Unbreakable Armor
and Five Shapes Fists

516
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:02,865
Three Forbidden City Cops are all here

517
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,699
the one inside the sedan chair
must be the emperor

518
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,168
We do want to arrest some stupid doctors

519
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:09,969
God knows, here comes a king!

520
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:14,377
How lucky are we to
have such good chance!

521
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:28,850
So what?

522
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:48,844
Protect me

523
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:35,911
It's great

524
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:36,606
So disgusting!

525
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:37,739
The participants can go
into the hall now

526
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,310
Honey, the meeting is going to start

527
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:42,919
Let's go

528
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,653
I can't miss this chance!

529
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,658
First, cut the belly

530
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,353
Tear its skin

531
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:51,191
Pull the intestines out

532
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,595
Then, its shit spitted out...

533
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,258
So exciting!

534
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:57,761
Honey, there are new clothes for sale

535
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:58,826
I am going to buy some

536
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,768
How to meet you later?

537
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:02,068
After the meeting
just go there to look for me

538
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:03,073
Alright

539
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,373
Don't wander off

540
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:09,408
Invitation card?

541
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,379
Invitation card?

542
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:11,677
This kind of invitation card

543
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,180
Please let me go, I am a doctor too

544
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,311
Are you a doctor?

545
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,720
Yes, I am a famous doctor

546
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:20,254
Alright, go in

547
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,948
Thank you, buddy

548
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:24,259
He doesn't know he is dying!

549
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:25,159
What?

550
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:42,073
Doctor... Doctor...

551
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:47,510
Doctor...

552
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:53,489
I've discovered that

553
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:54,786
I can make a medicine with
polycodonis and honey

554
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:57,420
This liquor is best for chain smokers

555
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,828
It cures sore throat

556
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:00,888
You will get rich!

557
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,029
I've discovered a new kind of plant

558
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:06,230
After eating it, you will laugh and cry

559
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,397
the natives call this grass

560
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:09,303
You will get rich too

561
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,035
You can tell it's drug which harm people

562
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,303
Better keep it yourself

563
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,072
Don't take too much!

564
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:14,669
You are right

565
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:15,508
Do you have any now?

566
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:15,807
Give me some

567
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:16,939
Later...

568
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:19,508
This doctor... I haven't seen you before

569
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,314
Your hat is so interesting!

570
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:23,547
Where do you work?

571
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,715
I am a gynecologist in the capital

572
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:26,882
To treat women?

573
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:28,355
You are rich!

574
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:32,252
Ladies and gentlemen

575
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:35,825
How are you

576
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:39,735
Welcome here to watch
the dissection of the Flying Fairy

577
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,664
This is a very precious chance

578
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:45,574
Now, this is solely shown to you

579
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,441
Where is His Majesty?

580
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,740
In order to let you see clearly

581
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:53,182
In five consecutive nights
we will repeat, repeat and repeat...

582
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:54,878
to show you the process
of the dissection

583
00:35:54,919 --> 00:36:00,186
To let you see it clearly

584
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:01,054
No need...

585
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:05,586
And, we have invited the farmers
who discovered it to this meeting

586
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:08,221
Let me now interview...

587
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:11,793
someone who witnessed
the discovery of the fairy first

588
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:12,928
that's a dog

589
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,923
Its eye is so big

590
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:40,487
Will it be clearer?

591
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,431
Where is its wing? How can it fly then?

592
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:43,558
It's really weird!

593
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,569
Kidding! It is small
or less the same as me

594
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,730
Right, as ugly as you

595
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:48,796
What are you doing?

596
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,306
I am checking its sex

597
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:52,874
It must be a girl

598
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,068
It is a girl

599
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:55,874
I know she is pregnant

600
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,244
What are you doing?

601
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:59,442
I am checking it's a man or a womam

602
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:02,179
Don't mess up!

603
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,812
Any gynecologist here?

604
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:05,082
He is

605
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,897
Move, move now

606
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,597
Why not... Give her some medicine?

607
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:25,798
Do you know dissection?

608
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:26,901
I know

609
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:28,309
Take this cutter and start working

610
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,211
I won't give it a damn

611
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,306
But, may I use this?

612
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:39,487
Don't move

613
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:41,786
Do you know how to dissect?

614
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:44,522
Cut from the throat
let the blood drain out first

615
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,530
I know it already

616
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:49,590
Come on

617
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:51,067
In fact, I am not a doctor

618
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,160
I am a butcher

619
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,338
You coward, you needn't find excuse

620
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:55,236
Let me do it

621
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,213
Have you fixed yet?

622
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,139
Good question, I've just fixed it

623
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:46,890
Wait

624
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,790
What's up?

625
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,698
His Majesty!

626
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,672
I know it's you!

627
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,404
Who chopped me?

628
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:09,606
Someone chopped you?

629
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,274
That's him!

630
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:12,646
But that is his sword

631
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,014
You bastard!

632
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:16,110
I want to chop you twice

633
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:19,221
What's wrong?

634
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,154
Why do you hold the sword?

635
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,716
Stay calm

636
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:24,488
Yes! There is conspiracy!

637
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,620
Conspiracy?

638
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:26,693
Your Majesty

639
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,858
I, Ling Ling Fat will protect you

640
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:39,802
My sword is sucked away, so powerful

641
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:40,868
Come on, one for each one

642
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:41,935
Your Majesty, you first

643
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:44,342
Wait

644
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,622
Don't despise us

645
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:00,653
We earn our living by holding swords too
Yes!

646
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,259
Don't get angry, drink some water first

647
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:05,325
All dead!

648
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:09,764
What kind of monster is it?

649
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,205
Try my Lo Chiu's Sword Stance

650
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:24,051
I wanna kill you! Give me

651
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,146
This is my sword!

652
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:36,557
Let's attack from both sides OK

653
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:34,523
So great!

654
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:37,825
Stop!

655
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,359
Are you kidding?

656
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:44,128
Why do you always beat me?

657
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:45,232
Boss

658
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:48,700
Your feet betrayed you

659
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,570
Don't you think I am a fool?

660
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:55,802
Hurry...

661
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:21,428
Watch me!

662
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:29,703
I know, same sex will reject each other

663
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:37,379
Fat, how are you?

664
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:41,819
This magnet is really great

665
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:51,029
Shit!

666
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,228
Different sex attracts each other

667
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:21,328
Are you kidding?

668
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:03,098
Yeah!

669
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:08,234
Fat, you're really something

670
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,439
Thank you. Your Majesty
we'd better leave

671
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,470
OK, let's go!

672
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:12,379
Leave now

673
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:25,991
Honey

674
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:30,264
Your wife has come too?

675
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,324
Introduce her to me

676
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:33,164
Go back first, here is so dangerous

677
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,588
Why there is one living?

678
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:53,920
Is there any
accident happened to my son?

679
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:55,585
Where is my wife!

680
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,456
Search! Many people are
lying on the floor!

681
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:58,959
Cut the crap, kill him

682
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,440
No matter where you're hiding
you have to be killed

683
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:52,746
Kill him

684
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:16,133
What the hell is it?

685
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,087
Kidding?

686
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:25,570
Hubby

687
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:27,272
Hubby

688
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:30,969
Same costume! Why?

689
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,107
Honey

690
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:35,643
Hubby

691
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,682
Where have you been?

692
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:46,587
I met a friend who
lives in the next village

693
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,394
There is a crazy sale in next village
so I went for shopping with her

694
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:51,100
What are you doing here?

695
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:52,996
I am... Iooking for you

696
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:55,231
Is there a fire?

697
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:56,967
We have had barbecue here

698
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:58,436
Barbecue?

699
00:47:58,475 --> 00:47:59,601
Yes, roast chicken wings

700
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:01,611
Why do they lie on the floor?

701
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,377
They are full, it's nice to have a rest

702
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:06,840
What's wrong with you?

703
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,351
You ate with violence, didn't you?

704
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,409
What the hell is it?

705
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,713
All people fought for one chicken wing!

706
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:13,746
I fought with all my might
that's the result

707
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:16,216
Don't you think I am nuts?

708
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:23,490
He...

709
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:24,496
Honey

710
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:30,397
You...

711
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,175
Where do you get this?

712
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:35,473
This?

713
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,348
If you like it, just take it

714
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,350
I don't mean it

715
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:41,646
and I don't want to take your advantage

716
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:44,381
If I want it
I will ask my husband to buy me one

717
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,911
He is damn rich

718
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:48,720
I want to tell you that
this doesn't match you

719
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,454
The color is no good

720
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:55,090
You have a big belly
this kind of clothes doesn't fit you

721
00:48:56,166 --> 00:49:00,262
We may have a look in the shops
of the nearby village

722
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:03,705
Let's go, let's have a look

723
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:11,905
My wife

724
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,346
She has fashion sense

725
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:19,446
Yes, she is nice

726
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:23,452
Brother Fat

727
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:36,028
Come on...

728
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,145
Come on...

729
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:13,135
Hubby, you have laughed
since you are back

730
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,906
What make you feel so happy?

731
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:20,272
This morning
I saw a fat woman fall into water ditch

732
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:24,782
A fat woman fell into water ditch?
What is so funny?

733
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:26,445
Fat woman!

734
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,448
Water ditch!

735
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:34,361
Honey

736
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:36,498
In all these years...

737
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:37,828
Listen to me

738
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:38,664
Go ahead

739
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:41,161
We have had poor living

740
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:43,470
Don't you mind it?

741
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,666
It depends on you

742
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:47,073
If you don't mind
eating the food I cooked

743
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:48,577
I don't mind too

744
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:51,238
In all these years

745
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:55,377
other than great inventions

746
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,046
I haven't sent anything
say diamond to you

747
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:58,145
Why don't you complain against me?

748
00:50:58,188 --> 00:50:59,246
Sure. I have complaints

749
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:01,280
That super groom

750
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:03,622
I have to clean the floor with two legs

751
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,150
My hands are free

752
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,787
So, I have to clean
the window with one hand

753
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,525
another hand to wash clothes

754
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,226
It's so troublesome!

755
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:11,632
You've discovered that!

756
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:12,566
Yeah...

757
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:15,162
And your air system

758
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:16,069
What's wrong?

759
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:19,234
I don't want to waste time to complain
it drives me crazy

760
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:20,208
Sure it will

761
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,234
What diamond have you hidden?

762
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:23,974
Take it out now

763
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,161
Honey

764
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:46,666
How are you?

765
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:52,941
Did you rob?

766
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:56,572
No, I didn't

767
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,075
I cured a man who is damn rich

768
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,515
He paid much money as medical fee

769
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,279
That's why I bought it to you

770
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:20,167
Honey!

771
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:22,603
Don't come over. Leave me alone

772
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:23,731
Are you alright?

773
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:26,638
I'm too happy, I can't control myself

774
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:30,342
So pretty

775
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:32,542
I love you, honey

776
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:36,651
I love you too

777
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:38,454
Forever

778
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:49,991
Fat, I heard that in the
biggest prostitute in town

779
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:52,968
there is a new girl called
Gum Tso who came from Gum Kingdom

780
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:56,232
Her name is so beautiful! It fancies me!

781
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:57,706
Go and check her background

782
00:52:57,741 --> 00:52:59,971
If she is OK, take her to me

783
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,602
Are you kidding, Your Majesty?

784
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:04,136
How can you let me
carry such nice mission?

785
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:06,477
You are the fellow I trust most
you know?

786
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,876
And, everyone knows
you are a good husband

787
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,478
You won't take my woman

788
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:13,279
So, you are the appropriate person
to take this job

789
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:14,887
May I be frank

790
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:18,287
Your Majesty
you have many concubines already

791
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:21,486
Why do you still want an affair?

792
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,641
You... The beauties have arrived!

793
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:10,237
Now, you understand?

794
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:14,505
Sure!

795
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,050
Your Majesty, please tolerate

796
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:18,847
I...

797
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,321
I will fix it as soon as possible

798
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,753
Bastards, who do you think you are!

799
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:26,523
We're high-class night club
You think we're prostitute?

800
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:27,687
Members only!

801
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:29,596
Take enough money if you
want to join our club

802
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,928
Damn it, I've fooled around for years

803
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,334
I haven't experienced
such embarrassing moment

804
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:36,430
Let's ask someone to ruin this place

805
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,241
Shut up

806
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:58,491
Damn it!

807
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:00,622
I am the procuress

808
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,632
Granny, do you wanna
sell your daughter to us?

809
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:03,633
Let me take a look at her first

810
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:07,229
She is beautiful

811
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:08,428
Look

812
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:19,912
So?

813
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:21,783
I wanna beat someone up

814
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:24,546
Can I slap her heavily?

815
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:29,318
Don't be so mean
you have to give others face anyway

816
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,419
You wanna beat me
I do wanna hit you hardly with rod too

817
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:35,326
Damn it
how can you talk to me in this way?

818
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:38,391
The girls here are all
as pretty as angels

819
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:41,402
Especially the girls from Gum Kingdom

820
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:42,871
You won't believe it

821
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:46,603
big eyes, tall nose, little mouth

822
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:48,844
Ask them to come out for a comparison

823
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:52,345
She is much more beautiful than you!

824
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:53,576
Get lost now!

825
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:55,106
Or, I will slap you! I mean it

826
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:56,243
She is coming out

827
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:58,516
The beauty from
Gum Kingdom is coming out

828
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,302
Miss

829
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:54,000
May l?

830
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:50,496
What's up?

831
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:54,128
You stand here without making a noise!

832
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:58,106
Don't you know dancing
or don't you know talking?

833
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:00,173
I don't know you

834
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:04,976
I am Gum Tso

835
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,317
Fat, so many women around!

836
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,321
Fat...

837
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:29,766
Honey!

838
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:31,971
Hubby, you're back!

839
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,505
Hubby
I've made a clothe for my birthday party

840
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:40,481
Isn't it pretty

841
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:43,517
It's good looking!

842
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:49,357
I invite many relatives and
friends to have dinner with us!

843
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:51,417
Remember to come home earlier!

844
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:55,257
Remember?

845
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:08,103
Hubby
I can smell fragrance from your body

846
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:12,644
Wonderful nose you have!
I bought you cosmetics!

847
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:15,414
Why do you buy me cosmetics?

848
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:16,713
For your birthday!

849
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:18,512
Good boy!

850
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:19,986
Have a bath first!

851
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:21,081
Alright, let's bath together!

852
00:59:21,357 --> 00:59:23,222
I have bathed. Go bathing now

853
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:26,160
Better bath again You go alone

854
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:50,449
I am the procuress
welcome to be our new member

855
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:53,911
Seeing you...

856
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:58,485
I have something, very, very...

857
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:01,656
Strange feeling that...

858
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:04,166
Say, you feel like slapping me

859
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:08,363
Right...

860
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:09,994
Right...

861
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:10,733
Correct

862
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:12,063
Correct

863
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:14,299
Is Miss Gum Tso here?

864
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:15,509
Sure!

865
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:16,645
I want to see her at once

866
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:18,010
Do you want to see her?

867
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:21,178
They are wishing to see Miss Gum Tso too

868
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:26,147
Line up, don't you think a handsome
& smart guy need not line up?

869
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:27,380
How can you tell I am smart?

870
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:29,186
I can tell you are sincere

871
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:30,817
and kind-hearted, too!

872
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:31,952
It's lucky to have a friend like you

873
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:33,492
Shit! You can tell it too

874
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:34,723
I have to treat you dinner!

875
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,295
Sure you have to

876
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:37,663
Line up!

877
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:39,665
Bastard!

878
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,323
Miss Gum Tso, I've waited you for ages!

879
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:08,126
Stay calm...

880
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,894
Miss Gum Tso wishes to treat you a drink

881
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:12,901
Take a glass over there

882
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:16,835
I want one

883
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,736
Miss Gum Tso, a toast to you

884
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:28,345
It's nasty. What's this?

885
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:29,282
Good wine!

886
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:35,390
What a nice wine
it makes one lose his mind!

887
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:40,591
This must be an old wine
of over 1 00 years old

888
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,690
I believe that this is
tribute from foreign country

889
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:45,125
Isn't it so precious?

890
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:46,465
Are you exaggerating, Pal?

891
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:48,134
You are totally wrong!

892
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:49,832
You drink it without tasting it

893
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,032
Even it isn't wine

894
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:52,939
you can never tell its taste!

895
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:56,308
Wine is like woman
you have to try it by some means.

896
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:59,075
Can anyone lend me his tongue?

897
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:00,976
Any longer one?

898
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:02,985
Right

899
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:06,646
The taste buds are on the
surface of our tongues

900
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:08,156
Not under

901
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:10,682
The sweet taste buds are in front

902
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:14,185
The bitter taste buds
are near the throat

903
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:15,789
Don't make it too deep

904
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:17,459
Alright, I'll place it in front

905
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,635
The sour taste bud is
on both sides of the tongue

906
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:22,103
So, when we taste good wine

907
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:24,231
roll the tongue

908
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:28,339
you need more practice

909
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:33,515
So, you can stop the wine
meeting the sour taste bud

910
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:37,144
And let the wine floats between
bitter and sweet taste buds

911
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:40,178
Sweet first, and then bitter...

912
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:42,914
Just like...

913
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:47,094
the sense of first love

914
01:02:57,974 --> 01:03:01,535
Congratulation, Gum Tso would like
to meet you in the sitting room

915
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:05,937
Miss Gum Tso... Don't be anxious

916
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,526
Why don't you...

917
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,290
You seem to have sore throat

918
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:24,731
Are you missing your wife?

919
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:28,703
How do you know that?

920
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:31,499
Chinese people usually
have early marriage

921
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:33,806
You seem to be mature and trustable

922
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:35,208
I guess, you must have married for years

923
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:36,903
You are flattering me

924
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:40,582
You don't seem to be Chinese

925
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:42,173
I come from Gum Kingdom

926
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:43,651
Do you have racial discrimination?

927
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,845
No way, don't be silly

928
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:49,150
Miss, you seem...

929
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:50,384
You are fat, and you are thin

930
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:52,760
You are bored

931
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:53,819
Give me a surprise

932
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:55,224
Do you want any surprise?

933
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:56,326
Do you have any?

934
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:58,122
Don't despise me

935
01:03:58,434 --> 01:03:59,025
Take it out

936
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:01,031
Do you want me to take it out?

937
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:01,827
Come on

938
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:05,536
This is for you

939
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:12,578
So pretty! Thank you

940
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,150
You are really different!

941
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:17,610
Usually, when the girls
see such precious pearl

942
01:04:17,653 --> 01:04:18,915
either they will scream

943
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:20,422
or, some will die because
of too much excitement

944
01:04:20,456 --> 01:04:23,721
You don't value material life at all
you are really...

945
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:25,517
Really different!

946
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:38,834
Mister, do you have time to stay?

947
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,433
To have a long talk?

948
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:44,212
My wife has prepared dinner
I don't think it's good for me to stay

949
01:04:44,513 --> 01:04:45,980
Why do you come then?

950
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:52,345
Even cats will be
motivated by such atmosphere!

951
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:55,285
Do you know what the cat is talking?

952
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,018
That cat said

953
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,491
Don't bother me, mom will scold me

954
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:10,865
Why do you hurt yourself?

955
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:16,505
It brings excitement!

956
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:17,677
So amazing!

957
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:21,583
There are many amazing things
you haven't tried that before

958
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:24,183
If you stay

959
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:27,417
I will try my very best

960
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:30,181
to make your all eyes

961
01:05:39,368 --> 01:05:39,891
I can't do that

962
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,029
I am married, I love my wife

963
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:44,471
Although I wish to do it
I have to control myself

964
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,766
Well, I won't give it a damn!

965
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:47,275
Come on...

966
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:52,781
A good husband is hard to
find in the world

967
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:54,806
Since you are thinking of your wife

968
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:56,147
I won't push you

969
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:57,015
Send Mister to the door

970
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:57,781
Yes

971
01:05:58,321 --> 01:05:59,948
Wait... Please leave

972
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:01,718
No, I've just made up my mind...

973
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:02,781
Please go back

974
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:04,349
So bad! I have halfly undressed!

975
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:05,291
Give me a chance!

976
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:06,522
Forget it, Mister

977
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:10,027
Miss Gum Tso

978
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:31,915
Cheers...

979
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:35,022
Sweet wine...

980
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:39,361
Hubby, what's wrong with you?

981
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:42,821
I haven't been that smart

982
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:45,667
There isn't any rice in your bowl

983
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:53,469
Hubby, I've discovered that
the cosmetic you sent me that night

984
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:56,569
doesn't smell like those
found from your body

985
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:58,276
Didn't I tell you?

986
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:01,410
That's made by a thing called Magic Musk

987
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:04,078
The smell will change according
to different timings

988
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,247
At night, it stinks

989
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,922
No, it doesn't stink

990
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:11,689
It stinks

991
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:16,697
On that day
you sent me a very big pearl

992
01:07:16,732 --> 01:07:18,666
I do want to show off tonight

993
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,601
But I couldn't find it out at all

994
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:22,160
Do you know where is it?

995
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:23,629
This is life

996
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:25,037
If you want to find something anxiously

997
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:26,541
you can never find it

998
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:27,940
If you are smart, you need not find it

999
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:29,877
cause it will show up later

1000
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,844
Father-in-law, have the chicken ass

1001
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:35,908
I remember

1002
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:37,612
Why did you go to the
prostitute house on that day?

1003
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,448
Prostitute house?

1004
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:39,317
Yes, prostitute house

1005
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:40,253
What did you say?

1006
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:44,721
I saw him visiting hookers

1007
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:53,430
Listen to me

1008
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:54,367
Wait

1009
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,204
Don't lie to me

1010
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,731
I can tell it's true or not easily

1011
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:10,010
Hooker is woman, she will get sick

1012
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:15,113
As a gynecologist
I went there for treatment

1013
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:18,320
It's nothing weird

1014
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:20,754
Daughter, is his heart beating fast?

1015
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:28,165
No

1016
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:33,207
That's good

1017
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:34,738
Sorry, hubby

1018
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:41,115
You are too bad for you
don't trust me at all

1019
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:23,618
It's fragrant! Can you smell it?

1020
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,403
Miss, who are you looking for?

1021
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:40,969
I come here to buy herb

1022
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:43,006
Do you have any chiretta
(means home coming in Chinese)?

1023
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:46,107
Are you in urgent need? Come later

1024
01:09:46,715 --> 01:09:48,012
I love a man very much

1025
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:49,415
He hasn't come to me for many days

1026
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:52,011
I come to buy chiretta which
means home coming in Chinese

1027
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:53,351
for I really want him to
come back this night

1028
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,660
Miss, I suggest you to buy Tu-wo
(means living alone)

1029
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:01,353
Living alone, don't bother others

1030
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:06,667
You have a kind of special smell
I smelt once!

1031
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:10,763
Yes, this perfume is called Hooking Soul

1032
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:12,865
Only I have this kind of
special perfume in town

1033
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:17,140
It is an amazing perfume
to seduce man, right?

1034
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:24,912
But I can't hook the man I love

1035
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:27,750
No matter how hard I torture myself

1036
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:30,554
he just brushes me off and comes here
to have dinner with his wife

1037
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:33,295
So, I come here to see his wife

1038
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:40,569
Today is my daughter's birthday

1039
01:10:40,603 --> 01:10:42,002
Don't mess up here

1040
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:45,197
You have seen what you want now

1041
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:47,201
So pretty

1042
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:48,702
Prettier than you

1043
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:50,535
Send her to the door

1044
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:51,443
Madam

1045
01:10:53,048 --> 01:10:54,606
Today is your birthday!

1046
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:56,249
I haven't any present

1047
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:59,047
But, why not
take this little thing as my present?

1048
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:12,027
Are you kidding?

1049
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:16,664
Right, when you don't want to find it
it will show up itself

1050
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:20,265
Are you kidding? You sent it to her?

1051
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:24,241
This is your present to me
how I can send it to others?

1052
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:27,004
What is your relationship? Tell me

1053
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:32,384
By the way, it seems to be clear!

1054
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:33,948
You bastard!

1055
01:11:35,157 --> 01:11:37,182
How can you treat my daughter like this?
Are you a man?

1056
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:39,120
Granny, don't be angry

1057
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:40,423
Give me back the pearl

1058
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:42,253
Madam, don't be excited!

1059
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:48,328
You bitch, I wanna kill you!

1060
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:52,936
Don't move Don't move

1061
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:55,173
If you hurt her, I will kill you

1062
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:58,007
If you hurt me, I will kill him

1063
01:11:58,647 --> 01:11:59,909
None of my business, lady!

1064
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:01,409
Stop her now

1065
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:06,314
Bitch!

1066
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:12,786
Drop the horse down

1067
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:14,418
What did you say, honey?

1068
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:17,323
Drop the horse

1069
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:19,630
You scared my friend

1070
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:22,296
You lied

1071
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:24,430
You said you would love me forever

1072
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,205
You lied too

1073
01:12:26,241 --> 01:12:28,471
You said you were born
in the year of rabbit

1074
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:30,109
but you were born in the year
of tiger, you are older than me

1075
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:34,682
You lied, you lied!

1076
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:36,314
Drop the horse

1077
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:37,410
Don't throw me while
I am not paying attention

1078
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:38,715
I can tell your trick

1079
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:47,654
Drop it, now!

1080
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:51,157
Are you alright?

1081
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,030
I am fine

1082
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:54,297
Sorry to ruin your party

1083
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:56,395
All because I wish to see you very much

1084
01:12:56,438 --> 01:12:58,269
I am too bad, I am leaving

1085
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:00,301
I will go with you

1086
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:02,367
It's nonsense for me to
stay in such nonsense family

1087
01:13:02,411 --> 01:13:03,139
Go

1088
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,240
Hubby

1089
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:11,477
Are you hungry?
Let me cook noodle for you

1090
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:22,359
Wait

1091
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:32,199
What a shame!

1092
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,869
Don't get angry
let's go back to my place

1093
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:35,968
I will do that with you

1094
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:36,773
That?

1095
01:13:36,812 --> 01:13:38,211
That's what you want

1096
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:43,843
You are inhumane!

1097
01:13:44,286 --> 01:13:45,514
Oh my God!

1098
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:18,651
We have become a couple at last

1099
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:22,446
On this stormy night
we will enjoy ourselves!

1100
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:24,583
You look cheap

1101
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:26,287
You haven't seen my cheaper look

1102
01:14:26,328 --> 01:14:28,489
Alright, listen to me

1103
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:29,929
I have had hard feeling

1104
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:32,024
Your wife felt so sad

1105
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:34,467
For you, I can sacrifice
my wife as well as my life

1106
01:14:34,503 --> 01:14:35,868
Don't say anything nonsense

1107
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:40,096
I don't want to cheat you

1108
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:43,703
I am a Forbidden City Cop
my duty is to protect His Majesty

1109
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:46,270
I came here for
His Majesty is fond of you

1110
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:47,680
He wants me to check your background

1111
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:52,112
You don't check me
you just want to screw me

1112
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:53,644
You are betraying His Majesty

1113
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:55,513
But I can't help loving you

1114
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:57,515
Forget about him!

1115
01:14:58,393 --> 01:14:59,655
Ling Ling Fat!

1116
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:09,059
Luckily you have come on time

1117
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:12,799
Did you hear everything?

1118
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:13,466
You!

1119
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:15,908
If she didn't write to His Majesty

1120
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:20,244
we wouldn't have known that
you betrayed His Majesty

1121
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:21,473
You...

1122
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:25,584
In order to trap him

1123
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:28,886
I don't mind risking my virginity

1124
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:32,759
Your Majesty, if you come a bit late

1125
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:35,059
I don't know what will happen!

1126
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:36,928
You...

1127
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:40,863
Ling Ling Fat, your family will have
capital punishment, you know?

1128
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:42,095
Your Majesty, l...

1129
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:42,933
Catch him

1130
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:57,045
Your Majesty, why do you cuff me?

1131
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:01,445
Your trap is really great!

1132
01:16:01,623 --> 01:16:04,319
You want me to break my family

1133
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:07,660
Then you make His Majesty kill me

1134
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:10,961
You will kidnap him
to blackmail the government

1135
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:13,797
Then your troop will move from
the North to take over our country

1136
01:16:13,835 --> 01:16:15,166
It seem to be a piece of cake

1137
01:16:15,203 --> 01:16:15,931
Damn!

1138
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:17,468
But, you remember the pearl

1139
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:20,805
which fancies all women in the world?

1140
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:23,333
When you received that pearl, you didn't
feel excited, that's why I know

1141
01:16:23,378 --> 01:16:25,869
you are not a woman

1142
01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:28,941
Who is my foe?

1143
01:16:28,984 --> 01:16:30,542
And who will undergo such
fantastic plastic surgery?

1144
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,577
Only a faceless old folk will do it

1145
01:16:33,021 --> 01:16:35,114
King of no face, you bastard!

1146
01:16:35,157 --> 01:16:36,715
I hate others to cheat me
by pretending as woman!

1147
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:38,225
Especially disguising as such
pretty woman to seduce me!

1148
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,989
Luckily Fat is so smart!

1149
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:41,154
He disclosed your secret

1150
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:42,020
Your Majesty

1151
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:43,798
Don't trust him!

1152
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:46,266
He wanted to screw me
so he brushed his wife off

1153
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:48,462
and he even beated
his wife up in front of me

1154
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:50,004
He isn't a man at all

1155
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,864
In order to trap you

1156
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:54,740
my family performed
a show in front of you

1157
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:56,738
Dear audience

1158
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:57,836
The best actress

1159
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:08,449
In the play

1160
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:11,186
she acted very well that

1161
01:17:11,226 --> 01:17:12,989
no matter judging from her eyes

1162
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:15,456
or movement

1163
01:17:15,497 --> 01:17:18,159
she could express how a sad wife feels

1164
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,465
Especially when she threw the horse

1165
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:24,939
it shows a strong protest originated
from post modernism

1166
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:26,531
Let us see how she threw the horse again

1167
01:17:26,575 --> 01:17:28,372
Watch! Watch!

1168
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:32,311
Mrs. Fat, congratulation...

1169
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:34,281
Thank you

1170
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:38,217
First of all, I have to thank my parents

1171
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:40,551
Since they have been supporting me

1172
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:43,057
And I have to thank my husband

1173
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:45,457
He gave me chance to act

1174
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,587
We had rehearsed many many times

1175
01:17:47,629 --> 01:17:50,291
So, this award is yours too

1176
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:51,492
Hubby, thank you

1177
01:17:53,935 --> 01:17:57,063
Alright, let's present the
final award of this night

1178
01:17:57,105 --> 01:17:59,573
I believe that, you can guess it. Right

1179
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:02,202
The best actor is...

1180
01:18:02,244 --> 01:18:03,541
Ah Fat's father-in-law

1181
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,811
Wonderful!

1182
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,721
This award should go to me

1183
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:18,059
I did see him visiting
the prostitute house!

1184
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:20,653
Please wait. I am sorry

1185
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:22,596
I am the leading man!

1186
01:18:22,631 --> 01:18:24,724
You can tell I have done a great job

1187
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:25,733
Why do you present the award to him?

1188
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:28,531
Your acting is quite good
but not mature

1189
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:31,061
Say, when your wife
heard your heart beat

1190
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:33,768
your expression was a bit exaggerated

1191
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:35,834
That's the point of view
of ordinary audiences!

1192
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:37,572
You won't be that ignorant?

1193
01:18:37,612 --> 01:18:40,103
No, when I heard your heart beat

1194
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:42,742
I couldn't feel any response from you

1195
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:44,945
I felt that, you couldn't
concentrate in acting

1196
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:46,419
You didn't act well indeed

1197
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:47,615
You...

1198
01:18:47,656 --> 01:18:49,283
Be fair

1199
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:50,655
Just one word

1200
01:18:50,692 --> 01:18:52,626
You don't know acting

1201
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:55,289
Shut up! Gum Tso's sex
is still a doubtful question

1202
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:57,696
How can you present awards here?

1203
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:58,529
It's a mess

1204
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:00,732
Your Majesty, l...

1205
01:19:00,769 --> 01:19:02,100
Be careful of your nostral hair

1206
01:19:03,438 --> 01:19:06,896
I am a person who is
willing to die for you

1207
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:09,809
Let me use my body

1208
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:11,870
to check whether Gum Tso
is a woman or not

1209
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:15,276
Get lost

1210
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:18,985
Be careful!

1211
01:19:37,973 --> 01:19:40,203
Ling Ling Fat
you killed my wife and my son

1212
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:41,937
Even I can't kill your family

1213
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:44,104
I want to kill you too

1214
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:45,443
Neither of you can go

1215
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:46,344
Protect His Majesty

1216
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:48,178
Fat-yan, take the Box of Treasure to me

1217
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:52,211
Catch it

1218
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:59,950
Why did you ask me to throw it to you?

1219
01:19:59,995 --> 01:20:00,962
Game over!

1220
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:02,762
I am sorry

1221
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:07,101
It doesn't hurt!

1222
01:20:09,604 --> 01:20:11,629
But the one next to you is in bad luck

1223
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:13,503
That's No-face Stance

1224
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:16,534
It can transfer energy

1225
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:32,386
Pal, are you alright?

1226
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:33,789
I am scared

1227
01:20:34,462 --> 01:20:36,020
But I am fine

1228
01:20:36,064 --> 01:20:37,497
I feel comfortable

1229
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:38,930
It's not painful at all

1230
01:20:38,967 --> 01:20:39,899
So, I won't give it a damn

1231
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:40,867
Let me do it

1232
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:51,038
Pal, didn't you say comfortable?

1233
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:53,138
It's really comfortable

1234
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:54,170
Forget it

1235
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:56,608
You'd better beat that guy

1236
01:21:01,756 --> 01:21:03,155
I have to think something else

1237
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:07,125
Forget it, please hit me

1238
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:15,835
It's not predictable

1239
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:26,374
No color, no face, long life to stay!

1240
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:28,507
I am the supreme of the world!

1241
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:46,996
Who is it?

1242
01:21:47,102 --> 01:21:48,194
My dear sister

1243
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:49,430
We all rely on you!

1244
01:21:51,172 --> 01:21:53,231
Soul Changing Stance

1245
01:22:17,532 --> 01:22:18,760
I feel dizzy, I can't stand it anymore

1246
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:22,868
It's cheap! Who do you want to scare?

1247
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:30,336
Don't you think such chain
can lock me up?

1248
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:35,613
It's not for locking you
it's used to connect the lightning-rod

1249
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:38,847
You said, we will enjoy ourselves
on a stormy night

1250
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:41,219
I'll let you try
a wonderful thunder storm

1251
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,188
Yeah

1252
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:46,716
Yeah

1253
01:22:46,761 --> 01:22:47,352
Yeah

1254
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:48,919
Yeah...

1255
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:01,195
Don't move!

1256
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:23,820
Fly...

1257
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:26,758
Flying...

1258
01:24:28,763 --> 01:24:29,752
Fa...

1259
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:33,462
Fairy

1260
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:06,118
The thunder hit Fat

1261
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:08,959
So it transform his cells

1262
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:11,966
During the process
he gained extra power

1263
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,026
So, he can release
the power of Flying Fairy

1264
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:19,705
At that moment, it seems that
there was a flying fairy in the sky

1265
01:26:19,741 --> 01:26:22,835
Isn't it illusion caused by air crash

1266
01:26:22,877 --> 01:26:25,038
or am I drunk?

1267
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:27,178
Of course you are drunk

1268
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:29,510
So, you have drunk much more than me

1269
01:26:29,551 --> 01:26:31,075
I am drunk everyday

1270
01:26:32,053 --> 01:26:34,681
It's strange
why hasn't Fat come to work today?

1271
01:26:35,089 --> 01:26:37,455
Brother Fat, where are you?

1272
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:39,721
We can't live without you

1273
01:26:39,761 --> 01:26:40,853
Brother Fat, come back!

1274
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:44,189
Hubby, it's so great!

1275
01:26:44,232 --> 01:26:48,669
Your new invention can
let us fly freely in the sky

1276
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:50,500
Let us name it...

1277
01:26:50,538 --> 01:26:51,368
Helicopter, isn't it nice?

1278
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:53,271
No, this isn't a good name

1279
01:26:53,308 --> 01:26:54,434
Why not name it...

1280
01:26:54,475 --> 01:26:56,602
Air air air air air O Plane?

1281
01:26:56,644 --> 01:26:57,542
You are so smart, honey

1282
01:26:57,579 --> 01:27:00,104
If not, how can I be your honey?

1283
01:27:00,248 --> 01:27:02,546
Hubby, let's fly again

1284
01:27:04,986 --> 01:27:07,648
So romantic! Yes

1285
01:27:07,689 --> 01:27:10,886
I want to have a baby with you

1286
01:27:10,925 --> 01:27:12,825
Really? Really

1287
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:15,624
Alright, let's go home and make love

1288
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:16,958
No way, I can't wait

1289
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:19,023
Let's do it here!

1290
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:21,661
You can't be serious Come on!

1291
01:27:22,305 --> 01:28:22,707
