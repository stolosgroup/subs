00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:30,375
<i>There's a group of men</i>
<i>called The Firm.</i>

3
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:35,791
<i>They've been running things
for a long, long time.</i>

4
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:40,375
<i>And when they need someone
to clean up their mess…</i>

5
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:43,083
<i>…They send me.</i>

6
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,158
<i>Go get your helmet.</i>
<i>Let's go to the store.</i>

7
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,666
<i>You look so cute, Nit.</i>

8
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:43,416
- <i>Sam.</i>
- Nathan.

9
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,875
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- At home. Sewing.

10
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,375
<i>Meet me at the diner.</i>

11
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,041
Why?

12
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,916
How much trouble am I in?

13
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,458
An extra scoop for my favorite client.

14
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:07,708
Thanks, Rose.

15
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,000
I put in an extra scoop
for my favorite client.

16
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:24,208
-Thanks, Rose,
-I'm sure she won't be long.

17
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,583
You clearly don't know
my mother very well.

18
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,125
Hey, stranger.

19
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,791
- Can I lighten your load?
- Not carrying today, Rose.

20
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:49,041
There's a first time for everything.
She's over there.

21
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,791
Thanks for keeping an eye on her.

22
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:16,583
You said you'd be here in 30 minutes.

23
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,500
I'm a few minutes late.

24
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,333
Three hours.

25
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:28,833
You're bleeding.

26
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,791
Just another day at the office.
Did you bring it?

27
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,791
Anna May sure can pick them.

28
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,541
- It's loaded.
- Good girl.

29
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,875
Listen, I, um…
have to disappear for a while.

30
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,833
- Then I'm coming with you.
- You can't. Not this time.

31
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,375
Nathan will be here soon.
He'll take care of you when I'm gone.

32
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,708
- I don't want to go with Nathan.
- I'm doing this for your own good.

33
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,958
I'll stay in the library
with Anna May and the others.

34
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,625
It's too dangerous.

35
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,583
What's going on?

36
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,125
It's… it's complicated.

37
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,750
Tell me.

38
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm not a kid any more.

39
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,500
No, you're not.

40
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,041
You haven't touched your milkshake.

41
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,250
Didn't want to drink it without you.

42
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,541
How long will you be gone?

43
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,166
I have to make a quick phone call.

44
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:29,791
Stay here.

45
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,583
Evening, gentlemen.
Can I lighten your load?

46
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,125
- Get lost.
- Hey.

47
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,208
Hello, little girl.

48
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,666
Mommy says I'm not allowed
to talk to strangers.

49
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:30,166
This "Mommy" looks a lot like you.

50
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,416
Only bigger and more stabby.

51
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,333
Got my father's blood all over her.

52
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,666
I don't like you.

53
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,625
Enough games.

54
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,166
Where is she?

55
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,375
Go kiss a pig.

56
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:08,375
Tell me where she is.

57
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:16,750
Close your eyes, baby girl.

58
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:38,791
Mom!

59
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:32,666
Evening, darling.

60
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,833
- Can I lighten your load?
- I'm clean.

61
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,000
Regular clean or diner clean?

62
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,416
- Forgot about this one.
- Of course, sugar.

63
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,541
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

64
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,958
Boy.

65
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,541
Oh, these girls are worse than the Stasi.

66
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,916
You hurt?

67
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,500
Just another day at the office.

68
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,791
Wow, you sound just like your mother.

69
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,708
I don't have a mother.

70
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,375
Well, you sure have her temper.

71
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,208
What the hell happened tonight?

72
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,041
Bad intel.

73
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:22,000
You said four or five idiots
with peashooters.

74
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,416
Yes. And?

75
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,916
Oh, for Christ's sake, child.

76
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,916
This was supposed to be low-profile,
not a bloody massacre.

77
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,125
Next time, I'll just let them shoot me.

78
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:41,125
Next time, just do what you're told.

79
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:46,083
Remember who you're working for.
As long as they're happy…

80
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:49,750
You called me here oh-so-urgently
just to remind me of that?

81
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
No.

82
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,208
Your talents are needed, pronto.

83
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,208
Somebody stole from us.

84
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,750
Who's crazy enough to steal from The Firm?

85
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,375
Somebody who doesn't know
who we really are.

86
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,291
An accountant.
From the clean side of the business.

87
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,833
How much did he take?

88
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,791
Enough to earn a visit from you.

89
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,083
We need that money back.

90
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,208
Good girl.

91
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,625
I'll text you the address later.

92
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:24,166
Oh, and get rid of
those stone-age firearms you carry.

93
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,041
- I've had them for years.
- Find an open vendor.

94
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,833
And get yourself some clean boomsticks.

95
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,625
We can't have you linked
to that war zone you left behind, can we?

96
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:51,375
Did you know about this
little endeavor my son had on the side?

97
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,875
Sorry, Uncle. I had no idea.

98
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,375
Where's the shoe?

99
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:24,791
What shoe?

100
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:28,000
The shoe that is not currently covering
my son's left foot.

101
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,791
The one that looks like the right one.

102
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,083
<i>That </i>fucking shoe.

103
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,791
- I don't know.
- Well, find it.

104
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,375
Found it, Mr. McAlester.

105
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,458
Nobody tells his mother about this.

106
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,625
We'll tell her he ran off with some girl.

107
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,333
I get it.

108
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:17,333
Now, bring me the heads of the men
that killed my boy.

109
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:49,708
Hmm.

110
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Hello, dear.

111
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,791
What can I do for you?

112
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,041
I need to exchange some… books.

113
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,250
Well, that's nice.

114
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,625
Not a lot of people your age
read nowadays.

115
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,416
- Do you have a card with us?
- No.

116
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,166
I'd like to open one.

117
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,375
Wonderful.

118
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,875
What kind of… books are you interested in?

119
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,208
Mostly smaller ones.

120
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,083
A few heavies.

121
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,375
Well, you won't find them there.

122
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,375
Those are our children's sections.

123
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,583
The Enchanted Forest…

124
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,958
and The Never-Ending Ocean.

125
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,208
They sound like fun.

126
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,708
Have we met before?

127
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,833
You seem so… familiar.

128
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,791
I'm embarrassed to say it's been a while
since I visited a library.

129
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,541
Well, that's no way to live, dear.

130
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,916
Let's get you into a good book.

131
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:00,833
Come.

132
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:36,416
Anna May, this lovely young lady
wants to open an account with us.

133
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,333
Well,

134
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:45,416
Madeleine should have told you
that we don't accept new readers

135
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,875
without a reference.

136
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,291
Madeleine had a hunch.

137
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:52,541
Fudge your hunches,
if you pardon my French.

138
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,375
- Technically not French.
- Always literal.

139
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:58,791
- Yes, I'm literary. I'm a librarian.
- Be that as it may.

140
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,791
Florence, dear.

141
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,208
Would you join us?

142
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,875
I'm afraid we need a tie-breaker.

143
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,750
Madeleine thinks this girl
needs to do some reading.

144
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,375
I told you I had a hunch.

145
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,291
There's something very familiar about her.

146
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,708
Hunch, smunch.

147
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:19,208
I, on the other hand,
think we should dispose of the body

148
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:22,875
and then have a long talk
about our onboarding protocols.

149
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,500
You know I can hear you, right?

150
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,625
Hush, girl.

151
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,375
Don't be rude.

152
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,041
Turn around, hon.

153
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,416
And take off your hat.

154
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,500
What did you say your name was?

155
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:55,666
She didn't.

156
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,375
Hmm. That's odd.

157
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,333
Well, girl?

158
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,625
Cat got your tongue? Speak up.

159
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,666
It's Sam.

160
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,291
Scarlet's kid.

161
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,083
Yeah.

162
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,000
I knew it. Never forget those eyes.

163
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,958
We haven't seen you
since you were yea high.

164
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,416
How is your mother?

165
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,250
Haven't seen her in 15 years.

166
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:27,000
Well, that's something
we both have in common.

167
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,541
My, my, my. Little Sam.

168
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,708
We hear about you all the time.

169
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,666
You've made
quite a reputation for yourself.

170
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,166
Come here. Give Auntie Madeleine a hug.

171
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,750
Why come back now?

172
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,041
I needed clean guns…

173
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,041
and I guess I needed an excuse.

174
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,583
Nice collection.

175
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,333
And you take good care of them.

176
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,583
Let me guess. You're the sentimental type.

177
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,125
<i>Ro-man-tique.</i>

178
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,750
Sentimental types
don't last long doing this.

179
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:13,708
So, no. I don't think
I'm the sentimental type.

180
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,291
Tommy Tomahawk.

181
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,666
I looked everywhere for him.

182
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,541
Yeah, sorry about that.

183
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,666
So…

184
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,875
you're an idealist.

185
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,583
Nope. Maybe I don't have a type.

186
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,416
Everybody has a type.

187
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,000
- Everybody.
- Mm-hmm.

188
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,375
Maybe I'm the professional type?

189
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,541
Ah. Old school.

190
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,875
"No women, no children" type.

191
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,208
Women are fair game.

192
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:42,958
Gender equality.

193
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,000
Very progressive.

194
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,500
She's a feminist.

195
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,000
Fine.

196
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,791
You get to live.

197
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,416
We'll make these disappear

198
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,916
and get you into some new, clean books.

199
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,666
You'll need a Jane Austen.

200
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,333
A Charlotte Brontë.

201
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,833
And a Virginia Woolf.

202
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,458
Oh, and an Agatha Christie.

203
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,625
For reading.

204
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:37,708
Please.

205
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,541
I need to answer this.

206
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:46,375
You need to walk away
and thank God I'm not in a killing mood.

207
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,250
I got no choice.

208
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,833
- No!
- Enough!

209
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,541
<i>Playing hard to get?</i>

210
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,666
<i>Not very smart, moron.</i>

211
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:36,166
<i>Not unless you want me to send
your little princess back in pieces.</i>

212
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,375
<i>You have exactly 60 minutes</i>

213
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:41,208
<i>to bring the money
to the Gutterball bowling alley.</i>

214
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,625
<i>A minute late, and she'll be celebrating</i>

215
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,666
<i>her ninth birthday with the worms.</i>

216
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,833
<i>60 minutes.</i>

217
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:52,708
Please.

218
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:54,708
It's my daughter.

219
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,000
Fuck me.

220
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:03,625
I'll get the doctor.

221
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:06,125
Guns go in the cookie jar.

222
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:16,416
- Hey. Haven't seen you in a while.
- Hmm.

223
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:19,125
And you brought a new friend.

224
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,583
- What the hell happened?
- I happened.

225
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:22,916
Just fix him.

226
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,125
I need him on his feet in ten minutes.

227
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,375
Ooh.

228
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:32,958
He's not going anywhere.

229
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,333
Not in ten minutes.

230
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,166
Maybe not ever.

231
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,291
- So what can we do?
- "We"?

232
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,125
Well, you can start
by not shooting people.

233
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:43,625
Please. My Emily.

234
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:45,333
- There's no time.
- Shh.

235
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,625
Just relax. Take it in deep.

236
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,250
Is that laughing gas?

237
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:50,875
Well, duh.

238
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,750
Just patch him up.

239
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,500
I'll be back soon.

240
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:56,625
He'd better be functional.

241
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,541
She's quite annoying, isn't she?

242
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:09,166
Who am I talking to?

243
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,250
The guy that she shot in the stomach?

244
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:20,083
- <i>Is it done?</i>
<i>- </i>There's a change of plan.

245
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:23,166
<i>What are you talking about?
What does that mean?</i>

246
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,333
They kidnapped his little girl.
That's why he stole the money.

247
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:29,291
If I'm not at the Gutterball
in 15 minutes, they'll kill her.

248
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:32,833
Sam, you're not thinking straight.
Just bring the money back, now!

249
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:36,000
I just need half an hour.
I'll release her and bring the money.

250
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,750
Okay. Listen to me, Sam.

251
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,625
If you screw this one up,
they will give the kill order.

252
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,750
<i>And I won't be able to stop them.</i>

253
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,208
She's just a little girl.

254
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:50,916
I can't leave her to die.

255
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,625
- I'm sorry.
- <i>Don't you dare hang up on me</i>.

256
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:55,958
- I'm sorry.
- <i>Don't you...</i>

257
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:57,083
Fuck.

258
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:15,250
Go to the Gutterball.
Try to reason with her.

259
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:17,416
Bring back the money.

260
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,208
Wait.

261
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:25,416
Now, when I say "reason with her,"

262
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,041
I mean no guns, no knives.

263
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:29,708
She comes back alive.

264
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:32,208
- Understood?
- Yeah.

265
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:35,208
And for God's sake…

266
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
be careful.

267
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:40,166
Remember who you're dealing with.

268
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,166
What are you waiting for? Go.

269
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,375
One of the men Sam killed
was Jim McAlester's son.

270
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:10,333
Are you sure
it was McAlester's kid?

271
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:11,708
Yes.

272
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,666
The board is on its way.

273
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,500
Goddammit, Sam.

274
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:04,375
<i>Who the fuck are you?</i>

275
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:08,000
Just someone who has your money.

276
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:09,833
I want the girl.

277
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:11,208
<i>Where's Daddy?</i>

278
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:13,416
He…

279
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:15,083
had an accident.

280
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:17,333
He sent me.

281
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:21,541
Do you want your money or not?

282
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:45,416
<i>The girl got to this point alive.</i>

283
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,041
<i>But if you as much as sneeze</i>

284
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,583
without my permission,

285
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,250
that could be easily rectified.

286
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,083
- Got it.
- <i>Good.</i>

287
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:56,625
<i>Now, see the locker behind you?</i>

288
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:02,916
W<i>eapon and phone go in the locker,</i>

289
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,875
<i>along with the clothes you're wearing.</i>

290
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:07,208
Slam the door shut, and it'll lock.

291
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:10,208
<i>Go to the Westfield Mall
across the street.</i>

292
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:12,708
You, the suitcase, the new clothes

293
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,666
<i>and the little girl's phone.</i>

294
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:18,416
Seriously?

295
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,708
Ten minutes.

296
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,166
Hello, Sam.

297
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:44,583
Bonehead.

298
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:47,083
- Hey, Sam.
- Sam.

299
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:51,041
Boneheads.

300
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:57,416
- I really don't have time for this.
- Nathan's worried about you.

301
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,916
Doesn't want you to do anything stupid.

302
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,500
So why don't you hand over the suitcase,

303
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:05,291
and nobody gets hurt.

304
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:10,208
Counter-offer: Go back to Nathan,
tell him you tried, but I roughed you up.

305
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:11,750
Ooh.

306
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,916
You can beat each other up
for added realism.

307
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:17,750
- That's funny.
- What?

308
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:19,791
No guns today?

309
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:21,791
Nathan doesn't want you hurt.

310
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:24,666
Not too badly, anyway.

311
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,958
Oh, that is so sweet.

312
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:30,625
I'll try not to kill you, too.

313
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:25,333
Who the fuck is she?

314
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,458
<i>Ground floor. Video Beast.</i>

315
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:10,541
Cutting it close.

316
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:12,583
I had a few hiccups.

317
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:16,416
We saw what you did with those hiccups.
How do we know you're not a cop?

318
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:19,000
Can a cop do what I just did?

319
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:21,291
I just want the girl.

320
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:24,833
Then we'll get along just fine.

321
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:26,750
There's a shopping cart behind you.

322
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:29,833
Put the suitcase inside.

323
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,750
Push the shopping cart towards us,

324
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:42,208
and we'll push the girl cart towards you.

325
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,041
One.

326
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:48,791
Two.

327
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:52,458
Three.

328
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:03,916
It's okay. You're safe.

329
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,875
I'll be right back.

330
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:15,666
We're all stinking rich,
you magnificent bastards.

331
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:17,916
Stop the fucking car.

332
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:19,708
Holy fuck!

333
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:44,583
You greedy traitor!

334
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:05,125
No… no!

335
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:06,250
No, no, no!

336
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,500
Fuck.

337
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:00,541
Anything broken?

338
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,250
- Are you bleeding?
- No.

339
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:04,000
Bleeding on the inside?

340
00:36:04,708 --> 00:36:05,875
How can you tell?

341
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:07,708
It's inside.

342
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,833
You're probably fine. Let's go.

343
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:13,000
Try to keep up.

344
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:28,666
I see you morons have found my stash.

345
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,750
This is some good shit, doc.

346
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:32,958
You should be very proud of yourself.

347
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,125
This is not a toy.

348
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:39,250
It's for medicinal use only.

349
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:48,791
So…

350
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,625
who fucked you up like this?

351
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,250
A girl.

352
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:02,416
A girl made you look
like you're from <i>The Walking Dead</i>?

353
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,583
I've never felt
pain like this before, doc.

354
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:07,416
She got us good, doc. I…

355
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:10,208
I don't think I'll ever walk again.

356
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,250
There must be an epidemic,

357
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:16,291
'cause I got a guy in the next room
who's got similar symptoms.

358
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,291
What do you mean?

359
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:19,583
I mean…

360
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,083
a girl fucked him up, too.

361
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:29,791
Keep talking, doc.

362
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:32,666
You're bleeding.

363
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:35,416
It's just a scratch.

364
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,166
It can get infected.

365
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:42,166
Worms will get in there and lay eggs.
Then they'll have to cut your arm off.

366
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:46,541
That's what they teach in school
these days?

367
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:48,125
Discovery Channel.

368
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:51,166
Thank God we're going straight
to the hospital.

369
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:52,791
Is my daddy there?

370
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,208
Yeah.

371
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,875
Is that why he didn't come?

372
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:00,708
Is he sick?

373
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:02,708
He…

374
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:05,083
It's okay.

375
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:07,166
You don't have to lie for him.

376
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:10,250
He never comes when he says he will.

377
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:20,458
Here, just let me help you.

378
00:38:24,708 --> 00:38:25,708
Thank you.

379
00:38:28,708 --> 00:38:29,708
Sure.

380
00:38:31,833 --> 00:38:33,166
Are you sure it's her?

381
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,625
<i>Yeah. She dropped off</i>
<i>some guy she shot.</i>

382
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:38,375
Said she's going to come back
and pick him up later.

383
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:40,208
And the money?

384
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:43,375
She had it last time we saw her.

385
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:45,375
Then get it back.

386
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:48,333
She's still getting the VIP treatment?

387
00:38:57,541 --> 00:39:00,458
- Do whatever it takes.
- <i>Alright, alright, alright.</i>

388
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:03,250
Now that's what I call a work benefit.

389
00:39:17,416 --> 00:39:19,541
Just, uh, stay behind me, okay?

390
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:42,083
Come on.

391
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:37,125
I'll get the doctor.

392
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:52,250
She's here.

393
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,916
Shot in the shoulder.

394
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,625
Maybe you should take your break now.

395
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:12,125
So. My payment?

396
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:15,583
- Oh!
- Shh.

397
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:17,333
Transferred to your account.

398
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,375
Now…

399
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:21,458
What's the plan, doc?

400
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:25,791
Oh.

401
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:29,166
Once I stick her with this,
she'll start losing control of her arms.

402
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:32,666
After 60 seconds or so…

403
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:35,083
she's a sitting duck.

404
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,250
What's wrong with you?
Let me do this right.

405
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:59,166
It's just a scratch.

406
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,791
Well, scratches get infected.

407
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:02,375
That's how you lose an arm.

408
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:05,625
Mm. Yeah, I heard.

409
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,583
What happened to him?

410
00:42:12,916 --> 00:42:14,125
Someone shot him.

411
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:16,333
I hear that's pretty lethal.

412
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:19,458
Let's fix this.

413
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:21,458
Don't. I'm good.

414
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,125
Trust me, you'll need this.

415
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:27,125
I said, I'm good.

416
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:31,458
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

417
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:37,916
You motherfu...

418
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:40,916
- Ah!
- 60 seconds!

419
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:43,833
60 seconds!

420
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:52,666
60 seconds.

421
00:42:53,916 --> 00:42:56,166
Oh, come on. Come on!

422
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:02,208
Listen, I need your help.

423
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:05,250
Some bad men are coming to hurt us.

424
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,333
Those who killed my dad?

425
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:10,375
I promise I'll explain,
but right now I need your help, okay?

426
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:11,875
- Okay.
- Good.

427
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:13,416
Grab the biggest knife.

428
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:15,791
Careful of the sharp end.

429
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:20,375
Okay…

430
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:21,458
Now grab the tape.

431
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:27,208
Excellent. Tape it to my hand.

432
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:32,916
36…

433
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:36,708
32…

434
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,666
Now tape the gun to my other hand.

435
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:50,583
Careful. It's loaded.

436
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:53,541
15… 14…

437
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,833
Round two, bitch.

438
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:02,291
Boneheads?

439
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:05,291
Better get ready!

440
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:07,833
Oh, thank God it's just you three.

441
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:10,750
For a second there,
I thought it was someone dangerous.

442
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:15,125
The only reason you're still alive
is 'cause Nathan wanted it that way.

443
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:19,333
Now, take my finger
and put it on the trigger.

444
00:44:19,416 --> 00:44:21,166
Well, it's over now.

445
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:24,125
I'm going to tear you into little pieces.

446
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:27,666
And I'm gonna love every second of it.

447
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,000
Great. Hold that thought.

448
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,166
I'll be right out.

449
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,583
You're being very brave, Emily.

450
00:44:44,166 --> 00:44:46,416
I need you to do one last thing for me,

451
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,458
and then go and hide, okay?

452
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:50,916
Okay.

453
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:17,125
Hey, Bonehead.

454
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:54,458
Emily.

455
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,708
I need you to come grab the phone.

456
00:48:14,416 --> 00:48:15,833
Come on.

457
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,125
It's okay. Just pick it up.

458
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:32,083
You are a goddamn rock star.

459
00:48:32,166 --> 00:48:33,500
Put it on speaker.

460
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,750
<i>Someone better start talking.</i>

461
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:38,833
That was a…

462
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:43,916
jerk move,
sending the Three Stooges after me.

463
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:47,500
You left us no choice, Sam.

464
00:48:47,583 --> 00:48:48,875
There's always a choice.

465
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:51,291
Oh, well, then,
we can still figure this out.

466
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:53,208
Just bring the money back.

467
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:56,583
<i>It's gone. The suitcase</i>
<i>was blown to 1000 pieces.</i>

468
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:01,541
Oh.

469
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,458
That's really unfortunate.

470
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:09,166
So now what?

471
00:49:09,916 --> 00:49:11,875
<i>Oh, you know the drill, Sam.</i>

472
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:13,875
You're no longer under our protection.

473
00:49:15,666 --> 00:49:18,416
<i>In your little massacre</i>
<i>earlier tonight,</i>

474
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,500
<i>you killed the wrong people.</i>

475
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:23,000
Including Jim McAlester's son.

476
00:49:24,541 --> 00:49:25,916
But I was sent by you.

477
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:27,791
By The Firm.

478
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:29,291
It doesn't matter.

479
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:34,750
This is business, Sam.

480
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:38,291
And you landed on the wrong side
of the balance sheet.

481
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:40,208
So…

482
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:43,750
It needs to be rectified.

483
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:48,750
How's this for business?

484
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:51,833
If I get out of this alive,

485
00:49:52,708 --> 00:49:54,375
I'm coming for you.

486
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:57,541
All of you.

487
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:01,083
I would expect no less.

488
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:04,666
Goodbye, Sam.

489
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:33,541
- Yes?
<i>- Mr. McAlester, this is Nathan.</i>

490
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:36,291
<i>I'm the head of the HR department
here at The Firm.</i>

491
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:37,583
What do you want?

492
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:40,916
<i>To prevent an all-out war
between our two fine organizations,</i>

493
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,208
<i>we would like to offer you
the woman responsible for your loss.</i>

494
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:47,541
So you had nothing to do with this?

495
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:51,000
I can assure you, this is not how The Firm
conducts its business, sir.

496
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:55,666
It was an unsolicited action
by a very troubled individual.

497
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,958
Now, I'm sending you her last location.

498
00:50:58,541 --> 00:51:01,500
I hope this is satisfactory, sir.

499
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:03,458
For now.

500
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:07,625
Take everybody.

501
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:10,125
Don't come back until it's done.

502
00:51:36,375 --> 00:51:39,208
- It's a text message from Nathan.
- What's it say?

503
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,750
"I'm sorry, child.
I can no longer protect you."

504
00:51:44,875 --> 00:51:48,166
"I left you a package to help you
survive the next few days."

505
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:50,541
"Take it, and disappear."

506
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:53,375
Then there's an address.

507
00:51:54,791 --> 00:51:56,166
That's close by.

508
00:51:57,666 --> 00:51:59,000
What if it's a trap?

509
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:17,791
Can you press the button?
We're parked on minus two.

510
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:46,875
Just remember, you were spared

511
00:52:46,958 --> 00:52:49,000
thanks to an eight-year-old girl.

512
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,916
Eight and three quarters.

513
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:54,500
Sorry.

514
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:56,625
Eight and three quarters.

515
00:53:07,875 --> 00:53:09,416
Are you a serial killer?

516
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:11,958
What?

517
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:16,166
No…
Where did you learn that expression?

518
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:18,750
- History Channel.
- Well…

519
00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:21,625
I am not a serial killer.

520
00:53:21,708 --> 00:53:23,875
But… you kill people?

521
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:25,833
Yes.

522
00:53:25,916 --> 00:53:27,833
So that makes you a killer.

523
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:29,875
And you've killed more than one.

524
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:31,333
That is serial.

525
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,250
It's…

526
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:36,000
It's more complicated than that.

527
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:40,375
Serial killers are, uh,
you know, mentally unstable.

528
00:53:40,458 --> 00:53:42,791
They kill people out of a compulsive urge.

529
00:53:45,583 --> 00:53:47,041
So, why do you kill them?

530
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:51,083
For money?

531
00:53:52,416 --> 00:53:54,041
Again, it's, uh…

532
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,708
It's complicated.

533
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:02,291
Look, I'm going to need your help
for a little longer.

534
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:04,000
Because your arms are still paralyzed?

535
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:06,125
Yes. After that,
I'll get you to your mother.

536
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:07,708
She left a long time ago.

537
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:09,916
- To your grandparents, then.
- They're dead.

538
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,250
Uncles? Anything?

539
00:54:21,875 --> 00:54:23,916
We'll figure it out, okay?

540
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:26,583
Okay.

541
00:54:27,416 --> 00:54:30,000
So, here's an unrelated question.

542
00:54:31,416 --> 00:54:32,708
Do you know how to drive?

543
00:54:34,125 --> 00:54:36,250
Let's go over it
one more time. Left.

544
00:54:37,166 --> 00:54:38,208
Right.

545
00:54:38,291 --> 00:54:39,875
Yes, I've got it already.

546
00:54:39,958 --> 00:54:42,208
"D" is for drive. "R" is for reverse.

547
00:54:42,291 --> 00:54:45,458
And you get to do the easy part,
stepping on the gas and breaks.

548
00:54:46,125 --> 00:54:48,458
Don't be a smart-ass. Turn the key.

549
00:54:50,416 --> 00:54:51,750
Put it in drive.

550
00:54:53,166 --> 00:54:54,375
Let's go.

551
00:55:14,041 --> 00:55:15,791
That's it. Straighten up.

552
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,041
I'm driving.

553
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:20,708
Yes, you are.

554
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:31,170
Don't worry about the bullets.

555
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:33,708
Reverse. Now.

556
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:38,208
Hard left!

557
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:42,291
- Put it in drive.
- Yeah.

558
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:45,875
That's it.

559
00:55:47,666 --> 00:55:49,125
Hard left.

560
00:55:49,208 --> 00:55:50,708
Go, go, go.

561
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:55,708
Damn it!

562
00:55:56,208 --> 00:55:57,791
Get ready. Hard left.

563
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,833
And another hard left.

564
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,750
Shh.

565
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,041
Okay. Put it in reverse.

566
00:56:22,208 --> 00:56:24,583
Hard right!

567
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:27,625
Put it in drive.

568
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,291
Hard left.

569
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,958
Put it in reverse.

570
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:41,083
Okay, kill the lights!

571
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,750
Okay, be quiet. Duck down.

572
00:57:07,833 --> 00:57:09,708
That's it. Get down.

573
00:57:21,166 --> 00:57:24,000
Okay. Put it in drive…

574
00:57:25,666 --> 00:57:26,875
and close your eyes.

575
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,333
Keep her straight.

576
00:57:47,791 --> 00:57:48,791
Keep it straight.

577
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:57,625
Are your eyes still closed?

578
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,541
- Yes.
- Good girl.

579
00:58:00,083 --> 00:58:01,375
Put it in reverse.

580
00:58:28,083 --> 00:58:29,833
Can I turn on the radio?

581
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:32,250
Go nuts.

582
00:59:29,916 --> 00:59:32,166
Emily, doorbell.

583
00:59:54,541 --> 00:59:56,791
Didn't I teach you
to always guard your back?

584
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:08,833
Hi, Mom.

585
01:00:10,333 --> 01:00:11,416
Hi.

586
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:22,500
Is this, um…

587
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:25,958
Am I a grandmother?

588
01:00:27,125 --> 01:00:28,291
God, no.

589
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Hi. I'm Emily.

590
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:36,958
- I'm her apprentice.
- What?

591
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:38,125
Emily.

592
01:00:38,625 --> 01:00:39,833
Come.

593
01:00:48,666 --> 01:00:51,583
<i>…the additional burden</i>
<i>of needing to care</i>

594
01:00:51,666 --> 01:00:53,708
<i>for her twelve-month-old daughter.</i>

595
01:00:53,791 --> 01:00:55,166
<i>It will be at least a year…</i>

596
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:04,333
That is a hell of a story.

597
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:07,625
Mm. Hell of a night.

598
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,375
Um… Try wiggling your fingers.

599
01:01:13,041 --> 01:01:15,833
- Feeling should come back in no time.
- Yeah, it's already working.

600
01:01:15,916 --> 01:01:17,291
Excellent.

601
01:01:21,416 --> 01:01:23,541
You look really good. Are you eating well?

602
01:01:23,625 --> 01:01:24,791
Cut the crap, Ma.

603
01:01:26,625 --> 01:01:28,708
Where have you been for the last 15 years?

604
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,083
Around.

605
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:35,500
Watching you.

606
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:39,666
Making sure you're safe.

607
01:01:40,333 --> 01:01:41,625
Great parenting.

608
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:44,458
Glad to see you taking an interest
in my career.

609
01:01:44,541 --> 01:01:47,791
- I never wanted this life for you.
- How's that working out for you?

610
01:01:52,708 --> 01:01:55,916
I wanted to stay with you
and your aunts, but I couldn't.

611
01:01:56,666 --> 01:01:57,916
Why not?

612
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:02,166
Because I fucked up.

613
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:09,458
I fucked up.

614
01:02:11,458 --> 01:02:13,125
I was young when I had you.

615
01:02:15,041 --> 01:02:17,666
We left London, followed your father here.
When he died...

616
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:19,541
When he was murdered.

617
01:02:21,916 --> 01:02:24,708
When he was murdered,
you were a baby. I had nothing.

618
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,416
No money, nowhere to go.

619
01:02:28,458 --> 01:02:30,458
I knew Anna May from your dad's work.

620
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:34,250
She and the other aunts took us in.

621
01:02:35,416 --> 01:02:37,291
The best years of my life.

622
01:02:37,375 --> 01:02:38,875
Me too.

623
01:02:42,708 --> 01:02:46,000
Fast-forward twelve years,
and I find out who shot your dad.

624
01:02:47,583 --> 01:02:48,875
The Russians?

625
01:02:49,708 --> 01:02:51,416
The Russians from the diner?

626
01:02:51,958 --> 01:02:55,375
Once I knew, I couldn't let him
walk around enjoying life…

627
01:02:57,208 --> 01:02:58,750
knowing what he did to us.

628
01:03:00,916 --> 01:03:04,416
But he was in bed with The Firm,
so there was a price to pay.

629
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:08,250
Once I killed him,
there was a mark on my back.

630
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:17,750
I couldn't take you with me.

631
01:03:20,208 --> 01:03:21,708
I couldn't risk your life.

632
01:03:25,208 --> 01:03:27,458
So I made Nathan promise to keep you safe.

633
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:33,125
I guess that's over.

634
01:03:36,416 --> 01:03:39,916
There isn't a day that goes by
I don't regret pulling that trigger.

635
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:42,625
But back then, I couldn't help myself.

636
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:48,458
I'm sorry.

637
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:03,333
Does the kid know about you and her dad?

638
01:04:03,416 --> 01:04:04,416
No.

639
01:04:06,833 --> 01:04:08,166
But she's smart.

640
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:10,666
She'll figure it out.

641
01:04:11,625 --> 01:04:13,125
What happens when she does?

642
01:04:30,416 --> 01:04:32,375
I think there's a bad man outside.

643
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:39,708
We have to get out of here.

644
01:04:44,791 --> 01:04:47,583
- So, what's the plan?
- Can you press the lobby button?

645
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:50,125
- What plan?
- Come on, you always have a plan.

646
01:04:50,208 --> 01:04:52,833
A secret escape route?
A warehouse filled with guns?

647
01:04:52,916 --> 01:04:53,958
I called us an Uber.

648
01:04:54,041 --> 01:04:55,500
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

649
01:04:55,583 --> 01:04:57,708
An Uber.
What the hell are you talking about?

650
01:04:57,791 --> 01:04:59,541
I know you. You make plans.

651
01:04:59,625 --> 01:05:01,791
And then you make plans
to make other plans.

652
01:05:01,875 --> 01:05:04,875
You're frothing at the mouth.

653
01:05:04,958 --> 01:05:06,458
It's unbecoming.

654
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:28,708
Get them!

655
01:05:34,166 --> 01:05:35,541
Don't feel bad.

656
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:37,541
Could happen to anyone.

657
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:39,333
My hand is still paralyzed.

658
01:05:39,416 --> 01:05:40,958
Yeah, course it is.

659
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:42,875
- It is.
- I know.

660
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:56,458
Right. After you, ladies.

661
01:05:57,208 --> 01:05:59,041
Come on. Hurry up.

662
01:05:59,708 --> 01:06:01,708
- Where does it go?
- Fucking Narnia.

663
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:02,791
Go. In.

664
01:06:03,291 --> 01:06:04,958
- In!
- Fine.

665
01:06:17,916 --> 01:06:20,958
- No plan, huh?
- Now is not the time.

666
01:06:21,916 --> 01:06:23,166
Out of my way.

667
01:06:28,708 --> 01:06:30,916
- Need help, Ma?
- No, thank you.

668
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,208
I'm quite capable…

669
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
of disposing of one…

670
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:37,166
…idiotic grate.

671
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:17,000
That freezer is a mess.
It's completely unacceptable.

672
01:07:27,166 --> 01:07:29,333
- Come on.
- Are you kidding me?

673
01:07:29,875 --> 01:07:31,625
- We have to go.
- Go where?

674
01:07:31,708 --> 01:07:33,625
Obviously your plan was to end up here.

675
01:07:33,708 --> 01:07:35,708
- That was a long time ago.
- Mom…

676
01:07:36,458 --> 01:07:38,416
- I'm not going in there.
- Mom, listen.

677
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,916
We need weapons and a car.
We need a safe house!

678
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,291
I'm not sure they'd let me in!

679
01:07:43,375 --> 01:07:45,041
Only one way to find out.

680
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:55,875
Hey.

681
01:08:11,041 --> 01:08:13,625
For the record,
I still think this is a shit idea.

682
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:28,458
Madeleine?

683
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:37,791
Girls, I think I see a ghost.

684
01:08:42,708 --> 01:08:45,041
- Hi, Madeleine.
- Hi, Scarlet.

685
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:46,291
Florence.

686
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,458
- Hi, Anna May.
- No.

687
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:53,166
No, no. You don't get to talk.

688
01:08:54,291 --> 01:08:56,958
Because you're a ghost,
and ghosts can't talk.

689
01:08:57,458 --> 01:08:58,708
You know how I know that?

690
01:08:59,291 --> 01:09:00,666
Can we do this later?

691
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:02,291
Because if ghosts could talk,

692
01:09:03,166 --> 01:09:05,875
they would say something
before disappearing.

693
01:09:05,958 --> 01:09:09,083
Or at least leave a note. But they can't.

694
01:09:09,166 --> 01:09:11,833
So, ipso facto, you're a ghost.

695
01:09:12,666 --> 01:09:14,250
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck you.

696
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:16,666
Language, Anna May.
There's a child present.

697
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:18,041
Fine.

698
01:09:19,041 --> 01:09:21,583
- Fudge you.
- Fudge you.

699
01:09:21,666 --> 01:09:23,625
Fudge you!

700
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:30,916
And why is there a toddler
in our place of business?

701
01:09:32,708 --> 01:09:33,708
The short version?

702
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:35,500
Please.

703
01:09:36,125 --> 01:09:39,000
Her father was killed
and she has nowhere else to go.

704
01:09:39,083 --> 01:09:40,708
I was downsized by The Firm,

705
01:09:40,791 --> 01:09:44,083
and they fed me to McAlester's
endless supply of thugs.

706
01:09:44,166 --> 01:09:45,791
And you decided to come here?

707
01:09:45,875 --> 01:09:47,708
Shall we return
at a more convenient time?

708
01:09:48,291 --> 01:09:49,541
Maybe you should.

709
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:52,000
It seems like
whenever you come here,

710
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:53,708
you bring a war with you.

711
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,125
Bring your problems...

712
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:00,125
We need to table this.

713
01:10:03,875 --> 01:10:05,041
Seconded.

714
01:10:05,583 --> 01:10:06,750
Let's go down.

715
01:10:24,916 --> 01:10:26,291
Go and take Emily.

716
01:10:26,791 --> 01:10:28,291
I'll buy us some time.

717
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:33,041
I think I should stay.

718
01:10:35,333 --> 01:10:36,458
No.

719
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:38,541
I screwed this up.

720
01:10:39,041 --> 01:10:41,333
I'll clean up my own mess.

721
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:44,666
We'll meet at the diner
once I've finished them off.

722
01:10:45,583 --> 01:10:47,958
Go.

723
01:10:48,041 --> 01:10:49,208
Please.

724
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:52,541
Come.

725
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:57,708
Are you sure?
I could use the target practice.

726
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,791
Mm-mm.

727
01:10:59,291 --> 01:11:00,541
Anna May was right.

728
01:11:01,916 --> 01:11:03,958
I shouldn't have dragged you into this.

729
01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:15,750
I'm staying with you.

730
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:18,041
No. No, you're not.

731
01:11:18,125 --> 01:11:20,875
You're going to the basement,
where it's safe.

732
01:11:20,958 --> 01:11:23,458
But you need me. I'm your apprentice.

733
01:11:23,541 --> 01:11:25,291
Okay, listen, Emily.

734
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:28,750
The bad men are coming.
I really need you to go with my mom.

735
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:31,333
No! I want to stay with you.

736
01:11:31,416 --> 01:11:32,708
- You can't.
- But why?

737
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:34,291
Because…

738
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:40,500
Because I killed your father.

739
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:45,291
You're lying.
You just want to get rid of me.

740
01:11:47,875 --> 01:11:49,291
Your dad, he, um…

741
01:11:50,291 --> 01:11:52,500
He stole from some very bad people.

742
01:11:54,083 --> 01:11:55,166
And they hired me.

743
01:11:57,666 --> 01:11:58,875
And I shot him.

744
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,083
Come on. Let's go.

745
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:23,500
I need weapons.

746
01:12:23,583 --> 01:12:25,250
Try the self-help section.

747
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:01,541
- I have to help her.
- You need my permission?

748
01:13:01,625 --> 01:13:04,333
- I can't bail on her again.
- Why? You're good at it.

749
01:13:04,416 --> 01:13:08,333
I'm sorry I couldn't give it up back then
and just stay here with you.

750
01:13:17,916 --> 01:13:19,250
You're human.

751
01:13:20,041 --> 01:13:21,458
You screwed up.

752
01:13:21,541 --> 01:13:25,041
I can only imagine
how painful it was leaving her behind.

753
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:39,625
Leaving us all behind.

754
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:43,291
But she grew up to be a fine woman.

755
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:53,250
I never wanted this life for her.

756
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:01,958
Maybe it was meant to be.

757
01:14:02,041 --> 01:14:04,958
Or maybe she wanted to be
just like her mother.

758
01:14:15,458 --> 01:14:16,583
I missed you.

759
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:29,083
We kept these ladies for you.

760
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:37,750
Just meet us at the diner.

761
01:14:37,833 --> 01:14:39,583
Come back in one piece, okay?

762
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:42,083
Both of you.

763
01:15:56,541 --> 01:15:57,791
Motherfucker!

764
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:44,708
Is anything broken?

765
01:16:44,791 --> 01:16:46,333
- Are you bleeding?
- I'm fine.

766
01:16:46,416 --> 01:16:47,875
Bleeding on the inside?

767
01:16:49,625 --> 01:16:51,166
The rest of them are coming.

768
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:53,208
Would it kill you to say thank you?

769
01:16:54,333 --> 01:16:56,625
You can still go, Ma. I'll cover you.

770
01:16:57,291 --> 01:16:59,541
And miss all the fun?

771
01:17:05,625 --> 01:17:07,208
<i>Women Who Run with the Wolves.</i>

772
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:11,541
- <i>Awakening the Giant Within.</i>
- Ammo?

773
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:13,583
<i>How to Win Friends and Influence People.</i>

774
01:17:32,166 --> 01:17:34,625
You should've stayed away
from this line of work.

775
01:17:34,708 --> 01:17:36,291
Are you kidding, Ma?

776
01:17:37,458 --> 01:17:38,500
You left.

777
01:17:39,041 --> 01:17:41,791
Killing people was the only thing
I knew how to do.

778
01:17:42,333 --> 01:17:45,833
Okay, maybe it wasn't the best environment
to raise a child in.

779
01:17:45,916 --> 01:17:47,375
You think?

780
01:17:48,833 --> 01:17:50,416
It made you who you are.

781
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,250
At least we can agree on that.

782
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:08,708
And you are a strong, smart,
incredibly impressive young woman.

783
01:18:10,916 --> 01:18:14,291
There's not a single person on earth
I'd rather kill people with.

784
01:18:15,916 --> 01:18:17,083
Thanks, Ma.

785
01:18:18,166 --> 01:18:21,750
You're so strong!
You can't be 8 and three quarters.

786
01:18:21,833 --> 01:18:22,875
I am.

787
01:18:22,958 --> 01:18:25,625
You sure you're not
28 and three quarters?

788
01:18:33,916 --> 01:18:36,416
Anna May, Madeleine. Come and see this.

789
01:18:45,625 --> 01:18:46,833
Oh.

790
01:18:47,541 --> 01:18:49,083
We're not leaving.

791
01:18:49,583 --> 01:18:52,625
Scarlet's still a librarian,
no matter if she's an asshole.

792
01:18:52,708 --> 01:18:54,458
- Language.
- Right.

793
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,416
- So these…
- Jerks.

794
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,416
…jerks up there

795
01:19:00,166 --> 01:19:02,708
just made the biggest mistake
of their lives.

796
01:19:02,791 --> 01:19:06,791
They stepped into our library
and threatened our own flesh and blood.

797
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:08,708
They're not gonna push us around.

798
01:19:08,791 --> 01:19:12,500
They're not gonna scare us off.
This ends now.

799
01:19:12,583 --> 01:19:15,541
Madeleine, finish getting the van ready.

800
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:19,666
Florence, you and I are going up there
to thin the herd.

801
01:19:20,291 --> 01:19:24,458
We're gonna bring the sky down
on their mother-fudging heads.

802
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
All in favor?

803
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:28,166
- Aye.
- Aye.

804
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:30,500
Aye.

805
01:19:33,291 --> 01:19:34,666
Motion carried.

806
01:20:39,166 --> 01:20:41,000
You think you have a chance here?

807
01:20:41,083 --> 01:20:43,250
I have an army.

808
01:20:43,333 --> 01:20:45,541
Oh, yeah? Well, I've got my mom.

809
01:20:53,875 --> 01:20:55,291
I wish we had more time, Ma.

810
01:20:56,375 --> 01:20:57,916
It's quality, not quantity.

811
01:21:01,208 --> 01:21:02,333
Chin up.

812
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:06,291
Why don't you come out,
and I'll put a bullet through your head?

813
01:21:06,958 --> 01:21:07,958
Nice and quick.

814
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:10,958
Why don't you go fudge yourself?

815
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,208
If you make me work for it,
I'll shoot you in the stomach.

816
01:21:17,291 --> 01:21:19,000
Then we'll have some real fun together.

817
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:30,708
Hey, dum-dums.

818
01:21:40,916 --> 01:21:43,666
Hey, idiots. Catch these.

819
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:41,541
Idiots to the left.
Morons to the right.

820
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:44,750
The rest of you knuckleheads stay here
and kill those two.

821
01:23:32,833 --> 01:23:33,916
Shh.

822
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Put these on.

823
01:23:55,041 --> 01:23:57,208
I'm gonna make a little noise,

824
01:23:57,291 --> 01:23:58,791
so play it loud.

825
01:23:59,416 --> 01:24:01,166
Can you do that for me?

826
01:25:55,875 --> 01:25:57,000
Sam!

827
01:25:57,791 --> 01:25:59,250
Reload!

828
01:30:44,083 --> 01:30:46,083
You've got something in your hair.

829
01:30:50,541 --> 01:30:51,666
It's a tooth.

830
01:31:11,083 --> 01:31:12,416
Hey.

831
01:31:16,833 --> 01:31:18,000
He…

832
01:31:18,083 --> 01:31:19,291
He took Emily.

833
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,791
I couldn't save her.

834
01:31:24,333 --> 01:31:26,250
It's okay.

835
01:31:26,333 --> 01:31:28,000
We'll get her back.

836
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,291
It was nice…

837
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,375
having a kid in the library again.

838
01:31:49,375 --> 01:31:50,500
Huh?

839
01:32:35,958 --> 01:32:38,791
"There is little joy in life for me"

840
01:32:39,916 --> 01:32:42,875
"And little terror in the grave"

841
01:32:42,958 --> 01:32:46,500
"I've lived the parting hour to see"

842
01:32:46,583 --> 01:32:50,208
"Of one I would have died to save"

843
01:33:14,916 --> 01:33:18,750
<i>Well, that was exciting.</i>
<i>Been a long time since I killed someone.</i>

844
01:33:19,375 --> 01:33:20,833
Let me talk to Emily.

845
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:23,458
<i>It's a real tragedy</i>

846
01:33:23,541 --> 01:33:26,833
<i>what happens to poor orphans
in our line of work, you know?</i>

847
01:33:27,625 --> 01:33:29,000
<i>It's really quite sad.</i>

848
01:33:31,875 --> 01:33:33,083
What do you want?

849
01:33:33,958 --> 01:33:36,083
<i>My uncle insists on meeting you.</i>

850
01:33:36,166 --> 01:33:38,291
<i>He says, skinning you alive will let him</i>

851
01:33:38,375 --> 01:33:40,875
<i>work through his, uh, grief.</i>

852
01:33:41,958 --> 01:33:43,958
<i>That's not too much to ask, is it?</i>

853
01:33:44,041 --> 01:33:45,458
If I come to you,

854
01:33:46,208 --> 01:33:47,583
Emily goes free.

855
01:33:48,625 --> 01:33:50,458
And everyone else is off the table.

856
01:33:55,083 --> 01:33:56,791
<i>Okay, we have a deal.</i>

857
01:33:57,458 --> 01:33:58,458
The diner.

858
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:00,416
<i>Can't wait.</i>

859
01:34:02,125 --> 01:34:03,125
We gotta go.

860
01:34:03,875 --> 01:34:06,666
You can't just hand yourself over
to those animals.

861
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:08,916
They can't bring guns into the diner.

862
01:34:09,708 --> 01:34:12,666
- It's Emily's best chance.
- It's a suicide mission.

863
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:14,833
Well, someone else got a plan? Hmm?

864
01:34:18,083 --> 01:34:20,250
I, uh… I don't right now, no.

865
01:34:22,583 --> 01:34:24,166
But it's you, Mom.

866
01:34:26,833 --> 01:34:28,500
You always have a plan.

867
01:34:29,458 --> 01:34:30,541
Sorry.

868
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:38,000
Then I guess this is goodbye.

869
01:35:14,291 --> 01:35:15,916
They're waiting for you, honey.

870
01:35:16,875 --> 01:35:18,166
Thanks, Rose.

871
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:40,333
Did they hurt you?

872
01:35:45,541 --> 01:35:47,375
It's been a long day.

873
01:35:48,708 --> 01:35:50,291
It's gonna be over soon, okay?

874
01:35:52,416 --> 01:35:53,500
Okay.

875
01:36:04,958 --> 01:36:06,666
You're a special kid, Emily.

876
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:11,125
I wish I had more time to get to know you.

877
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:28,750
I'm Jim.

878
01:36:29,916 --> 01:36:31,166
Samantha.

879
01:36:33,958 --> 01:36:35,250
You know, Samantha…

880
01:36:36,458 --> 01:36:39,750
I've always considered myself a feminist.

881
01:36:41,416 --> 01:36:45,125
When my first daughter was born,
I was over the moon.

882
01:36:46,375 --> 01:36:48,291
Painted half the house pink.

883
01:36:49,041 --> 01:36:52,458
It was all unicorns and lollipops.

884
01:36:54,625 --> 01:36:56,708
And my second daughter was born.

885
01:36:58,041 --> 01:37:00,208
And the third and the fourth.

886
01:37:02,333 --> 01:37:03,500
Girls…

887
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:08,083
always whispering at the dining table.

888
01:37:10,041 --> 01:37:12,500
Always giggling in dark corners.

889
01:37:15,166 --> 01:37:16,791
I love my girls.

890
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:19,791
But I don't understand them.

891
01:37:23,333 --> 01:37:24,916
Then my son was born.

892
01:37:26,791 --> 01:37:28,083
It was different.

893
01:37:28,833 --> 01:37:29,833
Simple.

894
01:37:32,666 --> 01:37:34,250
We understood each other.

895
01:37:36,083 --> 01:37:37,875
And I wasn't alone any more.

896
01:37:45,541 --> 01:37:46,833
I know…

897
01:37:49,291 --> 01:37:51,625
it was just a job to you, and he was…

898
01:37:52,541 --> 01:37:54,875
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

899
01:37:57,250 --> 01:37:58,625
None of that matters,

900
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:02,625
because you took him away from me.

901
01:38:06,708 --> 01:38:09,416
I'm going to do terrible things to you,
Samantha.

902
01:38:11,625 --> 01:38:14,833
You're going to suffer more
than you thought even possible.

903
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:21,291
Because you have made me
a stranger in my own home again.

904
01:38:22,833 --> 01:38:24,208
For what it's worth…

905
01:38:25,583 --> 01:38:29,333
I am very sorry about your son.

906
01:38:30,666 --> 01:38:32,333
Thank you, Samantha.

907
01:38:35,583 --> 01:38:37,291
Just let the girl go.

908
01:38:38,791 --> 01:38:39,791
Not yet.

909
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:45,250
We had a deal.

910
01:38:45,333 --> 01:38:46,958
And I'm a man of my word.

911
01:38:48,166 --> 01:38:51,083
I will set the girl free, unharmed.

912
01:38:53,750 --> 01:38:56,250
But only after she's watched
what I do to you.

913
01:39:01,291 --> 01:39:02,500
Please.

914
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:05,875
Please, I…

915
01:39:06,416 --> 01:39:08,458
I will do anything.

916
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,500
Don't start begging yet.

917
01:39:12,125 --> 01:39:14,000
There's plenty of time for that.

918
01:39:15,958 --> 01:39:18,791
- Can I get you something?
- No, we're just fine.

919
01:39:18,875 --> 01:39:21,458
Maybe some more coffee,
or apple pie?

920
01:39:21,541 --> 01:39:24,708
If I have to tell you no again,
there will be consequences.

921
01:39:33,958 --> 01:39:35,125
Hi, sweetheart.

922
01:39:37,208 --> 01:39:38,208
Hi, Mom.

923
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,291
Guess there was a plan, after all.

924
01:39:55,375 --> 01:39:56,916
Guess so.

925
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Why don't you take Emily out of here?

926
01:39:59,083 --> 01:40:00,833
It's no place for a kid.

927
01:40:00,916 --> 01:40:02,416
Stay out of this, ladies.

928
01:40:03,041 --> 01:40:04,125
It's not your fight.

929
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:07,541
There's no more standing on the sidelines.

930
01:40:07,625 --> 01:40:09,541
We all need to pick a side.

931
01:40:09,625 --> 01:40:11,250
Right, ladies.

932
01:43:52,875 --> 01:43:53,875
Emily.

933
01:44:27,750 --> 01:44:30,625
I am so sorry I killed your father, Emily.

934
01:44:32,333 --> 01:44:34,291
If I could take it back…

935
01:44:34,375 --> 01:44:35,458
I know.

936
01:44:36,458 --> 01:44:38,000
But you tried to save him.

937
01:44:39,833 --> 01:44:40,833
Still.

938
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:43,833
And you saved me.

939
01:44:49,125 --> 01:44:50,291
Thank you.

940
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:54,708
Besides…
I know you just pulled the trigger.

941
01:44:56,083 --> 01:44:58,750
I know there was someone else
who told you what to do.

942
01:45:00,208 --> 01:45:02,166
Who sent you to my father?

943
01:45:12,666 --> 01:45:15,500
There's a group of men called The Firm.

944
01:45:19,541 --> 01:45:22,416
It's a… It's a girl scout.

945
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:24,083
Get rid of her.

946
01:45:24,916 --> 01:45:26,375
No, wait.

947
01:45:27,291 --> 01:45:30,583
They've been running things
for a long, long time.

948
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:34,333
They make all the rules and…

949
01:45:35,916 --> 01:45:37,791
change them when it fits their needs.

950
01:45:43,333 --> 01:45:45,208
<i>They think they're untouchable.</i>

951
01:45:48,083 --> 01:45:50,541
They think they can get away
with anything.

952
01:45:52,416 --> 01:45:55,166
But they won't, right?

953
01:45:57,791 --> 01:45:58,791
No.

954
01:45:59,291 --> 01:46:00,375
They won't.

955
01:46:02,375 --> 01:46:03,625
Not any more.

956
01:46:09,750 --> 01:46:12,625
Well, well, well. What do we have here?

957
01:46:12,708 --> 01:46:14,666
I'm selling cookies.

958
01:46:14,750 --> 01:46:17,666
Oh, really? Uh, where are they?

959
01:46:20,125 --> 01:46:24,250
You're the little girl
that I've heard so much about, aren't you?

960
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,833
They think so little of me
they sent a child to do their dirty work?

961
01:46:33,916 --> 01:46:35,416
I'm insulted, frankly.

962
01:46:43,916 --> 01:46:46,416
"Look into your heart"?

963
01:46:54,416 --> 01:46:56,041
Fuck me.

964
01:46:58,791 --> 01:46:59,916
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

965
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,833
Loud and clear.

966
01:47:01,916 --> 01:47:03,666
<i>We're both alive and well.</i>

967
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:05,458
That's the way it's gonna stay.

968
01:47:05,541 --> 01:47:08,500
<i>Come on, Sam.</i>
<i>You know that's not up to me.</i>

969
01:47:08,583 --> 01:47:11,250
You get one chance to end this now.

970
01:47:12,458 --> 01:47:15,666
Years ago, my mom screwed up
and pulled the wrong trigger.

971
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:18,541
I'm not making the same mistake.

972
01:47:18,625 --> 01:47:22,083
<i>That little girl in front of you</i>
<i>will have a future.</i>

973
01:47:22,958 --> 01:47:26,583
Go back to the partners
and tell them we know where they work,

974
01:47:27,166 --> 01:47:28,291
where they live.

975
01:47:28,375 --> 01:47:32,125
We can kill them 100 times over
without them ever seeing us coming.

976
01:47:33,708 --> 01:47:36,166
Tell them they were only spared

977
01:47:36,666 --> 01:47:38,375
because of an eight-year-old girl.

978
01:47:38,458 --> 01:47:40,375
Eight and three quarters.

979
01:47:41,083 --> 01:47:43,541
Sorry. Eight and three quarters.

980
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:45,500
Got it?

981
01:47:45,541 --> 01:47:46,875
Got it.

982
01:47:47,375 --> 01:47:50,375
<i>Now, close your eyes</i>
<i>and count to ten.</i>

983
01:47:50,458 --> 01:47:51,708
<i>Slow.</i>

984
01:47:54,625 --> 01:47:55,625
One…

985
01:47:56,416 --> 01:47:57,708
two…

986
01:47:58,291 --> 01:47:59,375
three…

987
01:48:00,416 --> 01:48:01,416
<i>four…</i>

988
01:48:02,125 --> 01:48:03,125
