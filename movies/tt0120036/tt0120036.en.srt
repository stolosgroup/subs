Big Baby?

A nice day, ain't it?

You all get on now.

33
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:20,736
That'll be two pennies, please.

34
00:04:20,903 --> 00:04:22,404
Thank you.

35
00:04:24,907 --> 00:04:26,242
Girl, you better...

36
00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:27,993
go away from here.

37
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,495
How's the family?

Lovely day, ain't it?

41
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,042
Ooh, that it is.

42
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:36,544
You got that egg for me, boy?

43
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,710
Yes, sir.

44
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,380
There you are.

45
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:40,548
Thank you.

46
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:41,715
You're welcome.

47
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,050
- Here you go, Mama.
- All right.

48
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:45,010
All aboard.

49
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,070
Shoot.

50
00:05:46,614 --> 00:05:48,449
Shoot, for Christ sake.

51
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:50,576
You little mullet.

52
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:57,082
What, are you an Audubon
fella? You a bird-watcher?

53
00:05:57,249 --> 00:05:58,667
Come on.

54
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:03,464
This is going to be the first
boar you smoked yourself.

55
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:06,133
You know what them
Seminole injuns say?

56
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,968
You don't?

57
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:10,971
They say you only supposed
to kill what you gonna eat.

58
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:12,890
They say it's a sin if you don't.

59
00:06:13,057 --> 00:06:15,226
Damn Seminole.

60
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:18,479
Listen here.

61
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:21,148
Don't want you around that
coloured boy no more.

62
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:22,483
Arnett?

63
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,653
Don't look right, my boy
trailing around after a nigger.

64
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,197
But he Arnett. He's my friend.

65
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:30,991
That hurt?

66
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:32,368
No.

67
00:06:32,535 --> 00:06:33,661
Why you crying?

68
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:35,287
I ain't crying.

69
00:06:35,454 --> 00:06:38,541
You'll be a man soon.
I'll get you there.

70
00:06:40,376 --> 00:06:41,710
Hey, Duke.

71
00:06:41,877 --> 00:06:43,420
Seen any niggers out here?

72
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:44,964
No, sir.

73
00:06:45,131 --> 00:06:47,091
Well, one escaped off the
chain gang near State Road.

74
00:06:47,258 --> 00:06:48,676
Name's Jesse Hunter.

75
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:50,678
He might have headed for Rosewood.

76
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:52,596
You keep an eye out.

77
00:06:52,763 --> 00:06:54,974
You see him, don't shoot him.

78
00:06:55,141 --> 00:06:56,142
Bring him to me.

79
00:06:56,308 --> 00:06:58,769
All right. Yes, sir.

80
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:00,187
I say shoot him.

81
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:01,605
Drive.

82
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:06,901
Aunt Sarah.

83
00:07:06,902 --> 00:07:08,612
Sheriff.

84
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:30,216
Morning.

85
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:31,969
Morning.

86
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,058
I got a surprise for you.

87
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:40,478
- I wonder what it is.
- Don't move.

88
00:07:40,644 --> 00:07:42,813
Come on, baby. Stop it.

89
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,899
James, come on now.

90
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,400
Don't act like a child.

91
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:47,693
Fanny. Fanny.

92
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,195
Stop it now.

93
00:07:49,361 --> 00:07:50,362
Stop it.

94
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:51,529
Stop it.

95
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,530
Oh, Fanny.

96
00:07:52,531 --> 00:07:54,909
I said stop it. Go to work.

97
00:07:56,035 --> 00:07:57,828
Damn.

98
00:08:01,874 --> 00:08:03,209
Morning, Sarah.

99
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,336
Morning, Mr Taylor.

100
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:11,300
Floors need scrubbing, Aunt Sarah.

101
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:15,054
Relax, child. We already done
scrubbed all the cypress...

102
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:17,181
out of these old boards.

103
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,651
Watch out.

104
00:08:28,818 --> 00:08:29,860
Excuse me, Mr Taylor.

105
00:08:55,928 --> 00:08:57,721
Goddamn.

106
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,141
So he won't come around here, huh?

107
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:04,520
Earl, put the gun away.

108
00:09:04,687 --> 00:09:06,689
Hell, that boy ain't no
more off a chain gang...

109
00:09:06,856 --> 00:09:08,399
than I'm governor of Florida.

110
00:09:09,692 --> 00:09:11,068
Sit on down.

111
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,565
Bye, Emmett.

112
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,487
All right, settle down.

113
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:58,324
I'm gonna tell you a
story, ok? Pay attention.

114
00:09:58,491 --> 00:10:02,328
"Once upon a time, "there
was a pony named Dark...

115
00:10:02,495 --> 00:10:05,456
"who every night took little
people to Sleepy Town.

116
00:10:05,623 --> 00:10:08,459
"One night, as Dark
Pony started off,

117
00:10:08,626 --> 00:10:11,670
"he met a little boy named
Naughty who called out...

118
00:10:15,007 --> 00:10:16,007
"Please let me go.

119
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,384
"So Dark Pony whoaed...

120
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,261
"and Naughty hopped on his back...

121
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:20,763
"and away they went.

122
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:21,930
"They went galloping..."

123
00:10:22,014 --> 00:10:23,474
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

124
00:10:26,936 --> 00:10:29,230
Hey, Cousin Scrappie.

125
00:10:31,023 --> 00:10:32,316
Mr Carter.

126
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:34,693
You got yourself a customer.

127
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:43,369
Hey, mister, why
ain't you got a car?

128
00:10:43,536 --> 00:10:45,371
I like a horse.

129
00:10:45,538 --> 00:10:47,623
Car's faster.

130
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,876
I ain't in no hurry.
You got a name, boy?

131
00:10:51,043 --> 00:10:52,878
Yes, sir. Name's Arnett.

132
00:10:53,045 --> 00:10:55,881
Booker T., meet Arnett.

133
00:10:56,048 --> 00:10:59,343
Arnett, this here Booker T.

134
00:11:00,553 --> 00:11:02,054
Why ain't you in school, boy?

135
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:04,014
I'm working for Miss Fanny Taylor.

136
00:11:04,181 --> 00:11:07,143
She paying you to
follow me around?

137
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,193
Can I help you, mister?

138
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,447
Horse threw a shoe.
Need all four done.

139
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:22,199
Hell, can't get to
it till tomorrow.

140
00:11:22,408 --> 00:11:24,201
Closing early tonight.

141
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,536
Why so?

142
00:11:25,744 --> 00:11:27,705
It's New Year's Eve, sir.

143
00:11:27,872 --> 00:11:29,915
Dance tonight, 8:00, Mason Hall.

144
00:11:30,082 --> 00:11:33,002
Put that horse in the stable.
I'll take care of him for you.

145
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:35,212
That's a pretty horse, sir.

146
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:36,505
Thank you.

147
00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:04,241
Now, Lemuel, you
know me, I'm fair.

148
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,577
I charge a dollar a jug.

149
00:12:06,786 --> 00:12:09,580
But since you're into
me for $12 already,

150
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:12,082
I'm going to have to put
you down for three.

151
00:12:12,249 --> 00:12:14,043
Three dollars?

152
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,379
Oh, now, Mr Wright,
that ain't fair.

153
00:12:17,588 --> 00:12:22,760
I know I owes you a lots,
but I'm a regular customer.

154
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:24,261
One dollar.

155
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,888
Thank you, Mr Wright.

156
00:12:26,055 --> 00:12:27,890
You better stop drinking, Lemuel,

157
00:12:28,057 --> 00:12:30,601
before I own... your house.

158
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:37,274
Free of charge.

159
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:38,818
Go see after your father.

160
00:12:38,984 --> 00:12:40,402
Thank you, Mr Wright.

161
00:12:41,987 --> 00:12:43,280
Future customer.

162
00:12:43,489 --> 00:12:48,452
Sorry, I don't extend
credit to strangers.

163
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:51,789
You own that plot of
land across the way?

164
00:12:51,956 --> 00:12:53,791
I will...

165
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,876
this time tomorrow.

166
00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:00,381
Look at this, all these
melons, no good.

167
00:13:00,548 --> 00:13:03,425
Spoiled. Hog food now.

168
00:13:03,592 --> 00:13:07,304
Jewel, darling, you got
to throw these out.

169
00:13:07,471 --> 00:13:09,932
You got some .45 shells?

170
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,770
Clean out.

171
00:13:14,937 --> 00:13:17,189
Be going to Gainesville
first thing in the morning.

172
00:13:17,356 --> 00:13:19,817
I'll pick some up. You
still be around then?

173
00:13:19,984 --> 00:13:22,361
Might be.

174
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,162
What's wrong with you two today?

175
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:33,164
Every time I try to tell
you to do something,

176
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,665
you won't listen.

177
00:13:34,832 --> 00:13:36,233
You know, I will smack
you. I'll smack you.

178
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,252
No more playtime for
you, none. Not today.

179
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:44,175
Morning, teacher, madam.

180
00:13:44,341 --> 00:13:45,801
I wonder if you can tell me...

181
00:13:45,968 --> 00:13:47,970
where a man can find
hisself a good meal?

182
00:13:49,805 --> 00:13:51,474
You all go inside.

183
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:57,146
Well, my name ain't "teacher,
madam." It's Beulah.

184
00:13:57,313 --> 00:13:59,690
Folks I know call me Scrappie.

185
00:14:02,026 --> 00:14:05,321
Well, folks I know call me Mann...

186
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:08,324
Miss Scrappie.

187
00:14:11,368 --> 00:14:13,370
Nice to meet you, Mr Mann.

188
00:14:13,537 --> 00:14:14,789
Likewise.

189
00:14:19,835 --> 00:14:21,712
Now, this here Rattler, Mr Mann.

190
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,214
He a deer dog.

191
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,548
He help me hunt,

192
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:27,384
because he can get real
quiet, know what I mean?

193
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:29,386
All right, come on, boy.

194
00:14:29,553 --> 00:14:31,430
This way now. This way.

195
00:14:35,392 --> 00:14:39,772
So, what, what you
selling now, Mr Mann?

196
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:43,442
What makes you think I'm
selling something, Mr Carrier?

197
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:48,948
Well, I figure a coloured fellow
with nowhere particular to be,

198
00:14:49,115 --> 00:14:51,325
that man be selling something...

199
00:14:52,618 --> 00:14:55,204
or he running.

200
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,417
Well...

201
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:02,211
you figure wrong...

202
00:15:03,546 --> 00:15:04,880
friend.

203
00:15:12,888 --> 00:15:14,348
Come on inside.

204
00:15:17,435 --> 00:15:20,438
Hey, Gertie, got some good news.

205
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:22,731
Mr Mann here ain't
selling nothing.

206
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,276
Turn that music down.

207
00:15:25,443 --> 00:15:27,903
My husband got a suspicious mind.

208
00:15:28,112 --> 00:15:29,572
Oh, yes, I do.

209
00:15:31,115 --> 00:15:32,741
He's sweet on you.

210
00:15:32,908 --> 00:15:34,608
Scrappie, come over here and
help me with this bird.

211
00:15:36,412 --> 00:15:37,788
Must be New Year's.

212
00:15:37,955 --> 00:15:39,957
Yes, sir. Come on in, Mr Mann.

213
00:15:45,254 --> 00:15:46,922
Evening, Mr Mann.

214
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:48,424
Madam.

215
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:49,925
Thank you.

216
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:52,303
This is my brother James,

217
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,598
his wife Emma, and
their daughter Jewel.

218
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,769
Be quiet.

219
00:15:59,935 --> 00:16:02,521
Scrappie, show the man a seat.

220
00:16:04,023 --> 00:16:05,608
You can sit here.

221
00:16:06,609 --> 00:16:08,110
Thank you.

222
00:16:15,618 --> 00:16:16,952
Scrappie.

223
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:20,539
Now, I had a talk
with Mr Andrews...

224
00:16:20,706 --> 00:16:22,792
on your behalf today.

225
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,668
What about Mr Andrews?

226
00:16:24,877 --> 00:16:26,045
Mama, that old cracker...

227
00:16:26,128 --> 00:16:27,963
caught hisself whistling
at Scrappie and all that.

228
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,131
What?

229
00:16:29,298 --> 00:16:30,341
Yeah, that's right.

230
00:16:30,508 --> 00:16:32,134
I went over there and
gave him some words.

231
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:36,972
Sylvester, what you say
to them people now?

232
00:16:38,057 --> 00:16:42,853
Mr Andrews, I come to have a
word with you about my cousin.

233
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,607
Now, I expect you to
show her some respect.

234
00:16:46,774 --> 00:16:49,151
You expect, boy?

235
00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:53,489
I don't like Scrappie feeling
scared around nobody.

236
00:16:53,656 --> 00:16:56,075
That a threat?

237
00:16:59,537 --> 00:17:01,872
Ain't no threat needed.

238
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:04,875
I'm just saying I don't
mess with your peoples,

239
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:07,878
I don't want you
messing with mines.

240
00:17:08,045 --> 00:17:10,881
Now, I thank you very kindly, sir.

241
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:15,970
Sylvester, you can't talk
to white folks like that...

242
00:17:16,137 --> 00:17:17,972
and not expect a rope
around your neck.

243
00:17:18,139 --> 00:17:19,974
Look, times is changing, Mama.

244
00:17:20,141 --> 00:17:22,017
Now, I ain't no sharecropper.

245
00:17:22,184 --> 00:17:23,811
I'm a music teacher.

246
00:17:23,978 --> 00:17:28,023
Times ain't never changed
for no crackers, boy.

247
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,193
Don't you forget they
burned a coloured man...

248
00:17:31,402 --> 00:17:34,864
over in Wylie last summer for
winking at a white woman.

249
00:17:35,072 --> 00:17:36,072
Sure did.

250
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,575
I know that, Mama,

251
00:17:37,741 --> 00:17:39,577
but it's all right for them
to whistle at Scrappie?

252
00:17:39,743 --> 00:17:41,120
No, that ain't right.

253
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,377
What do you think about all
this business, Mr Mann?

254
00:17:48,544 --> 00:17:51,088
Oh, that man ready to eat.

255
00:17:51,255 --> 00:17:54,216
Would you like to say
the blessing, Mr Mann?

256
00:17:54,383 --> 00:17:55,843
No, madam.

257
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,970
I'll do it, Mama. I'll do it.

258
00:18:00,973 --> 00:18:04,143
Thank you for the
bounty of our lives...

259
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,562
and the blessings you've
bestowed on us...

260
00:18:06,729 --> 00:18:08,230
at home and family.

261
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:12,485
Can I have my yams now?

262
00:18:14,403 --> 00:18:16,238
Who wants ham?

263
00:18:16,405 --> 00:18:18,240
I want some yams.

264
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:20,743
Scrappie, come eat a
part of the bird...

265
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,411
that went over the fence last.

266
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:32,463
Well, at least ask him...
all right, all right.

267
00:18:34,924 --> 00:18:39,095
Madam, I ain't had a supper
like that in a long time.

268
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:41,013
Thank you kindly.

269
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,765
You're welcome.

270
00:18:42,932 --> 00:18:45,434
You been drifting long, Mr Mann?

271
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:47,269
Seem like forever.

272
00:18:47,436 --> 00:18:49,772
That ain't no kind
of life for a man.

273
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:54,777
You get yourself a good piece
of land, the right woman...

274
00:18:54,944 --> 00:18:56,779
a man can make a new
start around here,

275
00:18:56,946 --> 00:18:58,656
make something of hisself.

276
00:18:58,823 --> 00:19:01,200
Ain't that right, Scrappie?

277
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:08,082
Well, Aunt Sarah think Rosewood
coloured folks' heaven on earth.

278
00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:11,293
Best place these old
eyes ever seen.

279
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,463
Coloured folks own all
the land around here.

280
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,467
All the businesses, too, except
for Mr Johnny Wright's store,

281
00:19:18,634 --> 00:19:20,970
and he a halfway decent white man,

282
00:19:21,137 --> 00:19:23,347
if there ever was such a thing.

283
00:19:23,556 --> 00:19:27,435
Most of us doing better than
them folks over in Sumner.

284
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:30,938
You ever seen a place
like Rosewood, Mr Mann?

285
00:19:34,483 --> 00:19:35,901
No, madam.

286
00:19:52,084 --> 00:19:56,338
"Well, we know how to get money
when we need some," said Pecos.

287
00:19:56,505 --> 00:19:58,799
"All right," nodded Essex.

288
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:01,302
"That's fine.

289
00:20:01,469 --> 00:20:03,804
"But don't tell
anybody I told you...

290
00:20:03,971 --> 00:20:06,432
"or I'll cut off your ears."

291
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:10,269
He's a tough character, Essex.

292
00:20:10,436 --> 00:20:13,272
"Well, cross my heart
and hope you die,"

293
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,648
replied Lightning fervently.

294
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:16,859
"Well, that's fine,"
replied Essex.

295
00:20:17,026 --> 00:20:19,612
"Now, go home and shut up."

296
00:20:21,322 --> 00:20:23,449
"Or lose your ears,"
added Thunder.

297
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:28,662
And that's it. Next
chapter next week.

298
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:32,833
I'm going up Sumner, buying a
drink for some of the boys.

299
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,377
John, I was thinking
we might read aloud...

300
00:20:35,544 --> 00:20:37,338
from the Good Book tonight.

301
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:40,382
It'll still be good tomorrow.

302
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:43,385
All right, boys, up to bed.

303
00:20:43,552 --> 00:20:44,887
Dad, come on.

304
00:20:45,054 --> 00:20:46,788
Dad, could we please stay
up just a few more minutes?

305
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:48,708
Best do what your ma says.

306
00:20:53,062 --> 00:20:54,897
She ain't my ma.

307
00:20:55,064 --> 00:20:56,107
Timothy.

308
00:20:56,315 --> 00:20:58,859
What'd you say?

309
00:20:59,026 --> 00:21:00,486
What'd you say, Timothy?

310
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:03,405
What was that for?

311
00:21:03,572 --> 00:21:05,574
That's so you don't get to
thinking like your brother.

312
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:07,409
Get on to bed now.

313
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:09,120
Get on to bed.

314
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:15,292
Sorry about that, Mary, love.

315
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,755
I guess the boys still miss her.

316
00:21:19,922 --> 00:21:21,841
You do, too, I reckon.

317
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,929
You're damn right I
miss her. Pardon me.

318
00:21:27,096 --> 00:21:31,183
Only natural. Only been gone 7
months... 7 months, 3 days.

319
00:21:36,605 --> 00:21:38,941
I'm going to that
auction tomorrow.

320
00:21:39,108 --> 00:21:41,569
Get that plot of land.

321
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:43,320
Does that mean we're
staying, then?

322
00:21:43,487 --> 00:21:44,947
Ain't no sense of moving away.

323
00:21:45,114 --> 00:21:47,950
I get Bradley's 5 acres, build
some bins out back, sell feed.

324
00:21:48,117 --> 00:21:50,995
Make enough money, in a few
years, we'll move to Gainesville,

325
00:21:51,162 --> 00:21:54,957
open a bigger store, biggest
they ever seen in Florida.

326
00:21:55,124 --> 00:21:58,294
Did you ever consider
how I feel living here?

327
00:22:13,976 --> 00:22:16,562
Why don't you go on
and have that drink?

328
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,903
You be all right alone
here New Year's?

329
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:31,368
I got Jesus with me.

330
00:22:49,178 --> 00:22:50,638
Go ahead.

331
00:22:50,805 --> 00:22:52,723
There he is.

332
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,019
Gertie looks good.

333
00:22:59,105 --> 00:23:00,439
Watch yourself, there, Carter.

334
00:23:00,606 --> 00:23:02,608
Watch yourself there.

335
00:23:02,775 --> 00:23:05,111
I'm gonna cut a rug.

336
00:23:05,277 --> 00:23:07,113
Cut a rug.

337
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:10,241
Go on, cut that rug, but
don't cut it too deep.

338
00:23:30,636 --> 00:23:32,221
Come on.

339
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:37,435
Dance like he's riding Booker T.

340
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:46,360
Twirl that man, Scrappie.

341
00:23:51,157 --> 00:23:52,992
Listen here, now. You all
take notes, all right?

342
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:54,994
I don't want to have to
do this more than once.

343
00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:57,455
Come on, man, show
him how to do it.

344
00:24:12,928 --> 00:24:14,472
Sylvester can't do no dancing.

345
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:19,602
Africa.

346
00:24:19,769 --> 00:24:21,604
Africa.

347
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:22,813
Nigerian.

348
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,336
My arm. My arm. My arm. My arm.

349
00:24:45,503 --> 00:24:47,129
I got you. I got you.

350
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:10,694
I brung you some coffee.

351
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,824
I'm sorry.

352
00:25:17,576 --> 00:25:19,537
It's all right.

353
00:25:19,703 --> 00:25:22,665
I shouldn't have snuck up on you.

354
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:27,711
You riding out today?

355
00:25:31,882 --> 00:25:35,719
I might be here a couple
more days anyway.

356
00:25:35,928 --> 00:25:39,765
Thinking about looking in on
that piece of land over there.

357
00:25:45,563 --> 00:25:47,523
Bye.

358
00:25:59,618 --> 00:26:01,454
Morning, Mr Mann.

359
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,997
Morning, boy.

360
00:26:03,164 --> 00:26:05,916
Tomorrow's my birthday. You
gonna come to my party?

361
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:07,543
You gonna have cake?

362
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,795
Yes, sir, chocolate.

363
00:26:09,962 --> 00:26:12,089
Why is she skipping?

364
00:26:14,258 --> 00:26:15,551
Good coffee.

365
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,862
Morning, Mr Mann.

366
00:26:35,946 --> 00:26:38,616
Small town, people talk.

367
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:42,077
Old hangover remedy.

368
00:26:42,244 --> 00:26:43,829
My granddaddy taught me.

369
00:26:45,456 --> 00:26:47,249
Here's to the new year.

370
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,468
I'm sober now.

371
00:26:57,676 --> 00:26:58,676
I'm sober now.

372
00:26:58,677 --> 00:27:00,054
You got some peaches?

373
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,811
Story going around is you was
over there in the big one.

374
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,481
How long you fight?
Few months? A year?

375
00:27:12,024 --> 00:27:14,735
I'm a veteran myself, Navy.

376
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:17,238
Spanish-American War.

377
00:27:17,404 --> 00:27:19,240
Of course, the ass we
kicked only took one day.

378
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:22,743
Steamed into Manila
Bay May 1, 1898,

379
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:27,248
aboard the gunboat Concord
under old George Dewey.

380
00:27:27,414 --> 00:27:32,419
Set them 8-inch guns a-blazing
till smoke blotted out the sun.

381
00:27:32,586 --> 00:27:35,673
Sunk the Spanish fleet,
steamed out May 2.

382
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:44,765
Only eight Americans got wounded.

383
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:47,393
I had the audacity
to be one of them.

384
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:51,772
Where were you? France?

385
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:53,858
Put my foots in Germany, too.

386
00:27:54,024 --> 00:27:55,024
Germany?

387
00:27:55,067 --> 00:27:56,902
I'd like to see the
Kaiser's face...

388
00:27:57,069 --> 00:27:59,780
when you come running out
of the Black Forest.

389
00:27:59,947 --> 00:28:01,782
We didn't have no
coloureds on the Concord.

390
00:28:01,949 --> 00:28:03,784
Whole ship full of good old boys.

391
00:28:03,951 --> 00:28:05,286
Wouldn't have took to it.

392
00:28:05,453 --> 00:28:06,829
Maybe.

393
00:28:08,164 --> 00:28:12,751
The mortars start flying,
the gas start blowing,

394
00:28:12,918 --> 00:28:14,670
there ain't much colour
in them trenches.

395
00:28:14,837 --> 00:28:16,297
Is that right?

396
00:28:16,464 --> 00:28:18,132
You got them .45s?

397
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:21,761
.45s. Funny thing about the draft.

398
00:28:21,927 --> 00:28:24,263
I can't understand it. Pull a
coloured boy out of his home,

399
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:27,808
send him over there, tell him
dig trenches, kill white folks.

400
00:28:27,975 --> 00:28:30,394
That seem right to you?

401
00:28:30,561 --> 00:28:33,939
I wouldn't know much
about that, sir.

402
00:28:34,106 --> 00:28:36,400
I volunteered.

403
00:29:45,469 --> 00:29:47,638
You been double-timing me.

404
00:29:51,934 --> 00:29:55,563
Seeing that married Miz
Connelly over in Wylie.

405
00:29:59,942 --> 00:30:01,110
I know.

406
00:30:05,948 --> 00:30:07,783
Where you going?

407
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,660
Back to work.

408
00:30:10,953 --> 00:30:13,289
Don't you turn your back on me...

409
00:30:13,456 --> 00:30:15,332
when I talk.

410
00:30:19,962 --> 00:30:22,298
Damn swamp tramp.

411
00:30:22,465 --> 00:30:23,841
What you crying about?

412
00:30:24,008 --> 00:30:27,178
What you think you're
doing, hitting me?

413
00:30:27,344 --> 00:30:29,305
You little swamp tramp.

414
00:30:29,513 --> 00:30:31,474
You little swamp tramp.

415
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,100
Huh? You little chigger.

416
00:30:33,267 --> 00:30:35,352
You don't hit me.

417
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:36,520
You don't hit me.

418
00:30:38,522 --> 00:30:39,899
You don't hit me.

419
00:30:40,983 --> 00:30:42,485
Girl...

420
00:30:43,819 --> 00:30:45,696
Get out. Get out.

421
00:30:45,863 --> 00:30:47,198
Get out.

422
00:31:01,504 --> 00:31:02,838
Philomena.

423
00:31:15,392 --> 00:31:16,852
Miz Taylor?

424
00:31:17,061 --> 00:31:19,772
Is you all right, madam?

425
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,318
Go away, Philomena.

426
00:31:24,485 --> 00:31:26,403
But...

427
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,947
Get out.

428
00:31:28,114 --> 00:31:29,532
Get out.

429
00:31:37,581 --> 00:31:39,041
So you fight in the war?

430
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:42,878
Kill anybody over there?

431
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,590
I mostly dug trenches.

432
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,886
Still, it must've been
grand seeing Chicago...

433
00:31:51,053 --> 00:31:52,179
and New York.

434
00:31:53,556 --> 00:31:57,768
Shoot, I ain't been nowhere but
Rosewood, Sumner, Cedar Key,

435
00:31:57,935 --> 00:32:00,187
three times to Gainesville.

436
00:32:00,354 --> 00:32:02,398
Why you come back south?

437
00:32:02,565 --> 00:32:03,983
Maybe...

438
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:08,195
I was looking for Rosewood.

439
00:32:15,327 --> 00:32:16,328
Thank you.

440
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:22,710
Well, how come you ain't never
settled down before now?

441
00:32:23,961 --> 00:32:25,713
I was married...

442
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:29,049
once.

443
00:32:34,555 --> 00:32:37,224
My Aunt Sarah, she say I
ask too many questions.

444
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:38,434
I'm sorry if...

445
00:32:41,604 --> 00:32:43,189
How old you be, Scrappie?

446
00:32:43,355 --> 00:32:44,940
I'm 17.

447
00:32:45,107 --> 00:32:46,484
No man?

448
00:32:47,735 --> 00:32:49,195
- No young ones?
- No.

449
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:54,492
I just take care of my
little cousins, though.

450
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,413
Come on.

451
00:33:00,956 --> 00:33:02,458
Come on.

452
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:04,043
Where you going?

453
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:10,674
What you think about
this land here?

454
00:33:10,841 --> 00:33:13,677
Well, I likes it fine.

455
00:33:13,844 --> 00:33:15,304
Mr Wright...

456
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:19,391
He going to buy it, though.
He buying up everything.

457
00:33:20,643 --> 00:33:21,936
Maybe.

458
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,381
Hey, anybody.

459
00:33:51,465 --> 00:33:52,883
Hey, boy.

460
00:33:55,678 --> 00:33:58,013
Yes, sir.

461
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,473
You a travelling man?

462
00:34:02,017 --> 00:34:04,019
Who asking, sir?

463
00:34:22,204 --> 00:34:23,539
We got to help him.

464
00:34:23,706 --> 00:34:24,790
He ain't our problem.

465
00:34:24,957 --> 00:34:27,042
He a Mason, took the
oath, same as us.

466
00:34:27,209 --> 00:34:28,627
He's a white Mason.

467
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,549
Do you think he'd help you?

468
00:34:33,716 --> 00:34:34,967
Aaron, boy, I swear,

469
00:34:35,134 --> 00:34:37,970
sometimes you ain't got more
sense than some of these horses.

470
00:34:38,137 --> 00:34:39,597
Now, I'm telling you...

471
00:34:41,432 --> 00:34:42,850
that man...

472
00:34:43,017 --> 00:34:44,977
he ain't nothing but trouble.

473
00:34:46,061 --> 00:34:47,563
Yeah, well, let me
tell you something.

474
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:48,898
See, I ain't no boy.

475
00:34:49,064 --> 00:34:51,233
See, I's a man.

476
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,068
I's a Mason.

477
00:34:53,235 --> 00:34:54,737
What you be, Sam?

478
00:35:02,995 --> 00:35:05,164
Everybody sit down.
Let's get this done.

479
00:35:05,331 --> 00:35:06,499
Bradley, you got the deed?

480
00:35:06,665 --> 00:35:09,627
Yes, sir, I do, Mr Andrews.

481
00:35:12,463 --> 00:35:16,050
No, no, boy, I haven't
paid for it yet.

482
00:35:16,217 --> 00:35:18,219
We got to sell it first.

483
00:35:18,385 --> 00:35:21,347
Here. Give it here.
Give it here, boy.

484
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:26,185
We got here 5 acres in Rosewood...

485
00:35:26,352 --> 00:35:28,187
adjacent to Mr Johnny
Wright's store...

486
00:35:28,354 --> 00:35:29,855
sold as is, cash only.

487
00:35:30,022 --> 00:35:31,690
Let's open up at $52 an acre.

488
00:35:31,857 --> 00:35:35,319
52, 52. Who'll give
me 52 down front?

489
00:35:35,486 --> 00:35:36,821
53, 53, 53 from Monroe.

490
00:35:37,029 --> 00:35:38,906
54, 54, 54.

491
00:35:39,073 --> 00:35:40,073
Who'll give me 54?

492
00:35:40,074 --> 00:35:41,784
54, 54.

493
00:35:41,951 --> 00:35:43,911
John Wright again.
Thank you, John.

494
00:35:44,078 --> 00:35:46,163
55, 55.

495
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,582
55, anybody? Monroe, 55?

496
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:50,875
$54.

497
00:35:50,918 --> 00:35:52,378
Going once, going twice...

498
00:35:52,545 --> 00:35:54,255
$55.

499
00:35:56,632 --> 00:35:59,051
Boy, you know that's
$55 for each acre?

500
00:35:59,218 --> 00:36:00,302
That's damn near $300.

501
00:36:00,511 --> 00:36:02,555
Yes, sir, I do.

502
00:36:02,721 --> 00:36:03,721
Thank you kindly.

503
00:36:03,848 --> 00:36:05,099
Cash?

504
00:36:08,561 --> 00:36:10,521
Where's that nigger going
to get that kind of money?

505
00:36:13,691 --> 00:36:15,025
I have $55.

506
00:36:52,271 --> 00:36:54,231
Get back to work.

507
00:37:16,337 --> 00:37:18,881
Afternoon, Miss Fanny.

508
00:37:23,886 --> 00:37:24,887
Help.

509
00:37:25,054 --> 00:37:26,555
Help me.

510
00:37:26,764 --> 00:37:29,600
Somebody please help me.

511
00:37:29,809 --> 00:37:31,018
Somebody.

512
00:37:31,185 --> 00:37:32,436
Help me.

513
00:37:32,603 --> 00:37:34,313
Help.

514
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,273
Help.

515
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,440
Please.

516
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:39,443
Help me.

517
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:40,694
What's the matter, now?

518
00:37:40,861 --> 00:37:42,947
Please help me.

519
00:37:43,114 --> 00:37:44,740
Help me.

520
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,618
What's going on?
Fanny, what happened?

521
00:37:51,497 --> 00:37:52,957
Nigger.

522
00:37:53,999 --> 00:37:55,751
It was a nigger.

523
00:37:55,918 --> 00:37:56,919
What?

524
00:37:58,129 --> 00:38:02,550
He broke in my house,
and he beat me up.

525
00:38:02,716 --> 00:38:05,177
It was a nigger. It was.

526
00:38:09,807 --> 00:38:11,642
Sheriff. Sheriff.

527
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:12,852
Here comes that boy again.

528
00:38:13,018 --> 00:38:14,018
That would be Emmett.

529
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:15,020
Sheriff.

530
00:38:15,187 --> 00:38:16,897
Take a breath, boy.

531
00:38:17,064 --> 00:38:18,064
What's the matter?

532
00:38:18,065 --> 00:38:20,317
Your daddy's still
caught on fire again?

533
00:38:20,484 --> 00:38:22,903
Fanny Taylor got herself
beat by a nigra.

534
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,613
Oh, shit.

535
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,073
Damn.

536
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,828
Earl, that scatter gun loaded?

537
00:38:31,036 --> 00:38:32,705
No.

538
00:38:32,872 --> 00:38:34,290
Where the hell's my... my shells?

539
00:38:34,457 --> 00:38:35,708
Can't find my damn shells.

540
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:36,876
Here.

541
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:41,797
Go to the mill. Get James.

542
00:38:41,964 --> 00:38:43,382
Hold on.

543
00:38:46,844 --> 00:38:49,305
Keep this quiet before I
get the whole story. Go.

544
00:38:49,513 --> 00:38:51,113
- What's going on?
- Mind your own damn business.

545
00:38:51,114 --> 00:38:52,114
Come on, boy.

546
00:38:52,183 --> 00:38:53,976
When I want you to do something...

547
00:38:54,143 --> 00:38:57,313
and I tell you to do it...

548
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,399
Fanny Taylor's been
raped by a nigger.

549
00:39:02,693 --> 00:39:05,613
Go on out there and do that.

550
00:39:14,163 --> 00:39:17,792
Hey, James, I need to talk to you.

551
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:21,253
Your wife's been beat and
raped by a coloured man.

552
00:39:23,464 --> 00:39:24,715
What the hell you talking about?

553
00:39:25,508 --> 00:39:26,717
57.50.

554
00:39:26,884 --> 00:39:28,427
$58.

555
00:39:32,098 --> 00:39:33,390
58.50.

556
00:39:42,983 --> 00:39:44,276
$60.

557
00:39:47,363 --> 00:39:49,365
Boy, how you planning
on paying $300?

558
00:39:49,532 --> 00:39:51,700
You got a bagful of gold?

559
00:39:51,909 --> 00:39:53,744
Could be, sir.

560
00:39:53,911 --> 00:39:54,954
Henry...

561
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:56,455
can't you see what
this boy's doing?

562
00:39:56,622 --> 00:39:58,040
He ain't going to buy nothing.

563
00:39:58,207 --> 00:40:01,127
He's just driving up the
price for old Bradley.

564
00:40:01,293 --> 00:40:04,255
Mr Andrews, sir, I
don't know that man.

565
00:40:05,714 --> 00:40:08,175
With all due respect, Mr Wright...

566
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:13,180
if that what you believe, maybe
you should stop bidding.

567
00:40:13,347 --> 00:40:16,142
You gonna let that
nigger beat you, Johnny?

568
00:40:16,308 --> 00:40:18,060
60 goddamn 50.

569
00:40:23,315 --> 00:40:24,775
A nigger raped Fanny Taylor.

570
00:40:24,942 --> 00:40:26,318
Listen up.

571
00:40:26,485 --> 00:40:28,320
We got to call this off for now.

572
00:40:28,487 --> 00:40:30,573
What? I ain't going
nowhere. I got a bid in.

573
00:40:30,739 --> 00:40:32,158
We'll pick it up
tomorrow at $60.50.

574
00:40:32,324 --> 00:40:33,451
Let's get this done now.

575
00:40:33,617 --> 00:40:36,203
John, Fanny Taylor's
been raped by a nigger.

576
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,370
My deed.

577
00:40:37,496 --> 00:40:40,124
I'll lock up the deed.

578
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:42,543
Boy, your name Jesse Hunter?

579
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,710
No, sir.

580
00:40:43,836 --> 00:40:45,546
I suppose you can prove that?

581
00:40:45,713 --> 00:40:47,798
Got my discharge, sir.

582
00:41:05,858 --> 00:41:08,194
Just who do you
think you are, boy?

583
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,946
With all due respect, Mr Wright,

584
00:41:11,113 --> 00:41:13,699
long around this time tomorrow,

585
00:41:13,866 --> 00:41:16,827
I expects to be your
neighbour, sir.

586
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,470
Welcome to Levy County, Mr Mann.

587
00:41:35,137 --> 00:41:36,639
Get out of the way.
Come on, back off, now.

588
00:41:36,806 --> 00:41:38,766
Come on, come on, come on.

589
00:41:40,226 --> 00:41:41,977
Jesus, Fanny.

590
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:44,855
Who raped you?

591
00:41:45,022 --> 00:41:48,651
No, jeez, Ellis, I
sure wasn't raped.

592
00:41:48,859 --> 00:41:50,528
I just got beat.

593
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:53,864
I was beat badly.

594
00:41:54,031 --> 00:41:55,031
Badly.

595
00:41:55,032 --> 00:41:58,077
He was so big.

596
00:41:58,244 --> 00:42:00,496
He's so black, that boy.

597
00:42:00,663 --> 00:42:02,873
She says she was raped.

598
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,041
Raped and beat.

599
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:06,377
Shut up, you all. Everybody
go on out of here.

600
00:42:06,544 --> 00:42:08,629
Show's over. You heard me.

601
00:42:08,796 --> 00:42:10,214
Go on home.

602
00:42:10,381 --> 00:42:11,799
Go on.

603
00:42:11,966 --> 00:42:12,967
Come on.

604
00:42:14,051 --> 00:42:15,428
Let's go in the house.

605
00:42:15,594 --> 00:42:16,929
It's ok.

606
00:42:17,096 --> 00:42:19,348
It's all right.

607
00:42:19,515 --> 00:42:22,560
It's ok. Come on. Give her
some breathing space.

608
00:42:22,768 --> 00:42:24,019
Damn.

609
00:42:24,228 --> 00:42:26,313
Listen to me.

610
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,358
We've known each other
a long time, huh?

611
00:42:29,525 --> 00:42:31,277
I want you to think
about this, now.

612
00:42:31,444 --> 00:42:32,736
You tell me.

613
00:42:32,903 --> 00:42:35,573
This is Ellis. You
tell me the truth.

614
00:42:35,739 --> 00:42:39,160
Was it truly a coloured
that done this to you?

615
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:41,537
Be sure, darling, that
is all I'm saying.

616
00:42:41,704 --> 00:42:44,623
Yes, he was coloured.

617
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:47,918
He was a nigger, nigger, nigger.

618
00:42:50,004 --> 00:42:51,589
Jesus, angel, what happened?

619
00:43:06,729 --> 00:43:08,981
You seen this boy, Sarah?

620
00:43:12,693 --> 00:43:14,779
Ain't got to mess around. We got
to do something about this.

621
00:43:16,739 --> 00:43:18,574
No, Mr Ellis.

622
00:43:18,741 --> 00:43:20,409
I ain't seen nothing.

623
00:43:23,245 --> 00:43:24,455
All right.

624
00:43:29,752 --> 00:43:31,420
Hey, what you all doing?

625
00:43:32,755 --> 00:43:34,632
Miss Fanny... Miss Fanny
Taylor, she got raped.

626
00:43:34,799 --> 00:43:36,092
- And beat.
- And she got beat,

627
00:43:36,258 --> 00:43:37,593
and she said it was
a coloured man.

628
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,261
But it was a cracker. I seen him.

629
00:43:39,678 --> 00:43:42,807
Well, I guess now we're
looking for a nigger convict,

630
00:43:42,973 --> 00:43:46,227
escaped yesterday off the
chain gang near Wylie.

631
00:43:47,937 --> 00:43:49,563
Name is Jesse Hunter.

632
00:43:50,648 --> 00:43:52,650
Oh, good. Here are the hounds.

633
00:43:52,858 --> 00:43:55,528
Take them all around
back, pick up a scent.

634
00:43:55,694 --> 00:43:57,154
Go on.

635
00:43:57,321 --> 00:44:00,157
You acting like you the
leader of this here mob.

636
00:44:00,324 --> 00:44:02,743
I am the leader, and
this ain't no mob.

637
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:09,792
We got him, boys.

638
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,335
See where they're headed?

639
00:44:11,502 --> 00:44:13,379
You all see where they're headed?

640
00:44:15,214 --> 00:44:16,674
Come on, boy.

641
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:22,221
Shut up, you all.
They got a scent.

642
00:44:22,388 --> 00:44:24,056
Hush.

643
00:44:24,223 --> 00:44:25,891
Go have a look. You
all go that way.

644
00:44:40,281 --> 00:44:41,824
He ain't done nothing.

645
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:46,370
What did the boy do?

646
00:44:46,537 --> 00:44:47,997
You all be quiet. Be quiet.

647
00:44:48,164 --> 00:44:49,832
Poly. Poly.

648
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,040
Put that gun away.

649
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:53,878
- This is serious business.
- Yes, sir.

650
00:44:54,044 --> 00:44:56,547
You got to tell me the truth, boy.

651
00:44:56,714 --> 00:44:57,965
Did you rape Fanny Taylor?

652
00:44:58,132 --> 00:44:59,592
- Rape?
- No, sir. No.

653
00:44:59,759 --> 00:45:01,260
Do you know who did?

654
00:45:01,427 --> 00:45:02,727
I don't know nothing, Mr Walker.

655
00:45:02,728 --> 00:45:03,888
You know who did.

656
00:45:04,054 --> 00:45:05,514
Go.

657
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:09,769
My boy ain't done nothing.

658
00:45:23,073 --> 00:45:26,494
Hey. Here comes old Johnny Wright.

659
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,995
Hello, Johnny.

660
00:45:28,162 --> 00:45:29,205
Hey, Bobby.

661
00:45:30,664 --> 00:45:32,041
John.

662
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:33,542
How's that new wife
of yours working out?

663
00:45:33,709 --> 00:45:35,211
She's coming right along.

664
00:45:35,377 --> 00:45:37,588
Sorry about that auction,
John. The boy bid.

665
00:45:37,797 --> 00:45:39,465
Yeah, a hell of a thing.
What you got here?

666
00:45:39,632 --> 00:45:41,092
Now we got a good one.

667
00:45:41,258 --> 00:45:44,095
That boy raped Fanny Taylor.

668
00:45:44,261 --> 00:45:45,261
Is that right?

669
00:45:45,346 --> 00:45:48,474
We got us Aaron Carrier, John.

670
00:45:48,641 --> 00:45:49,641
Aaron Carrier?

671
00:45:49,767 --> 00:45:51,685
Watch that gun, boy.

672
00:45:51,852 --> 00:45:52,852
How you doing, Johnny?

673
00:45:52,853 --> 00:45:54,105
You got the wrong boy.

674
00:45:54,271 --> 00:45:56,023
Hate to tell you, Aaron
Carrier wouldn't rape a fly.

675
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:57,566
Dogs led us straight to his house.

676
00:45:57,733 --> 00:45:59,193
You know the boy that did?

677
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,821
Nigger won't talk, either, John.

678
00:46:01,987 --> 00:46:03,239
I know his family.

679
00:46:03,405 --> 00:46:04,990
Let me talk to him.

680
00:46:05,157 --> 00:46:06,824
Yeah, hell, maybe you can
get something out of him.

681
00:46:06,951 --> 00:46:08,202
I sure as hell can't.

682
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:10,579
Aaron, this is Mr Wright.

683
00:46:10,746 --> 00:46:11,956
You know something about all this?

684
00:46:13,582 --> 00:46:14,792
Duke, how's he supposed to talk

685
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,134
when you're choking him like that?

686
00:46:16,252 --> 00:46:17,503
Well, he don't need
to talk, Johnny.

687
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:19,304
He need to hang from one
of them trees over there.

688
00:46:20,506 --> 00:46:22,299
You all think this is real funny?

689
00:46:22,508 --> 00:46:24,844
Hey, you would, too, if you was
the one that sold me this rope.

690
00:46:26,262 --> 00:46:27,721
Good point, John.

691
00:46:28,806 --> 00:46:30,057
He's a good boy.

692
00:46:30,224 --> 00:46:31,308
He ain't done nothing.

693
00:46:31,517 --> 00:46:32,601
Duke, don't hurt him.

694
00:46:32,768 --> 00:46:35,187
Emmett, come on over here,
boy. Hold onto this rope.

695
00:46:35,354 --> 00:46:36,814
There's a boy.

696
00:46:36,981 --> 00:46:38,281
You know this boy's
family as well as I.

697
00:46:38,357 --> 00:46:39,608
That's right. I do. I know.

698
00:46:39,775 --> 00:46:40,775
And you know he's a good boy.

699
00:46:40,776 --> 00:46:42,110
They're good people.
They're good people,

700
00:46:42,111 --> 00:46:43,779
but we got a dilemma here, John.

701
00:46:43,946 --> 00:46:46,657
We got a dilemma. I'm going
to tell you what it is.

702
00:46:46,824 --> 00:46:48,325
Hounds don't lie.

703
00:46:48,492 --> 00:46:49,492
Be a man, now.

704
00:46:49,577 --> 00:46:52,413
You got to take that
rope and snap, crack.

705
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:55,458
Can't lynch that boy,
Ellis. Can't lynch him.

706
00:46:55,624 --> 00:46:57,710
I ain't going to let
nobody get hanged.

707
00:46:57,877 --> 00:46:59,670
I ain't going to let it
happen. It won't happen.

708
00:46:59,879 --> 00:47:01,589
Now grab that rope.
Come on, grab it.

709
00:47:01,756 --> 00:47:04,967
About 4 summers ago, I
went over to Chiefland.

710
00:47:05,134 --> 00:47:07,303
A coloured boy over there was
looking in the window...

711
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:09,972
at a white girl watching
her take a bath.

712
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:11,307
Did he say something?

713
00:47:11,474 --> 00:47:13,142
No, he didn't.

714
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,084
Maybe he don't know nothing
if he didn't say nothing.

715
00:47:15,085 --> 00:47:19,148
You should have seen them
go crazy on that boy.

716
00:47:19,315 --> 00:47:21,358
Beat him about half to death.

717
00:47:21,525 --> 00:47:22,943
Boy wouldn't stop screaming.

718
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:25,196
We helped him to the railroad
track. Number 7 come along...

719
00:47:27,198 --> 00:47:28,783
cut his head clean off.

720
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:32,536
Niggers don't run
around like a chicken.

721
00:47:32,703 --> 00:47:33,996
Once that head's off, he's dead.

722
00:47:36,957 --> 00:47:38,709
Sam Carter.

723
00:47:38,876 --> 00:47:40,127
Sam Carter?

724
00:47:40,294 --> 00:47:41,962
What about Sam Carter?

725
00:47:42,129 --> 00:47:43,422
What about Sam?

726
00:47:43,589 --> 00:47:44,589
Sam the blacksmith?

727
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:45,590
Sam Carter raped Fanny Taylor?

728
00:47:45,758 --> 00:47:47,301
No.

729
00:47:47,468 --> 00:47:48,928
A man. A Mason.

730
00:47:49,053 --> 00:47:50,721
What man? Who you talking about?

731
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,890
Sam took him in the waggon.

732
00:47:53,057 --> 00:47:54,475
We was holding the oath.

733
00:47:54,642 --> 00:47:55,851
What are you talking about?

734
00:47:56,018 --> 00:47:57,436
String him up.

735
00:48:01,065 --> 00:48:02,632
This boy's under arrest.
I'm taking him to jail.

736
00:48:02,741 --> 00:48:03,875
We're going to string this boy up.

737
00:48:03,876 --> 00:48:05,069
Oh, no, you ain't.

738
00:48:05,277 --> 00:48:07,071
All right, take the boy,
but don't you let him go.

739
00:48:07,279 --> 00:48:09,179
Hey, don't you worry about what
I am or ain't going to do.

740
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,574
You hear me, Poly?

741
00:48:10,741 --> 00:48:12,408
- We're going to get Sam.
- You get on out of here.

742
00:48:12,535 --> 00:48:15,204
Do you understand? You go do it.

743
00:48:15,371 --> 00:48:17,581
Hey, listen to me.
You go with them.

744
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:20,292
Don't let them do nothing until
I get there, you hear me?

745
00:48:20,459 --> 00:48:22,420
You go, too. Ellis, you go.

746
00:48:22,628 --> 00:48:24,088
I'll take old Aaron in.

747
00:48:24,296 --> 00:48:26,882
Them boys is all riled.

748
00:48:27,091 --> 00:48:28,759
Aaron, this is all
your damn fault.

749
00:48:28,926 --> 00:48:30,136
You should've said
something earlier.

750
00:48:30,302 --> 00:48:32,847
Damn.

751
00:48:39,353 --> 00:48:43,774
Carter. Carter.

752
00:48:47,653 --> 00:48:49,113
Hey, Booker T.

753
00:48:50,948 --> 00:48:52,908
Up, boy. Up.

754
00:49:51,133 --> 00:49:53,552
Thank you, Mr Wright.

755
00:50:07,149 --> 00:50:09,068
Sam, what you know about
this Jesse Hunter, boy?

756
00:50:09,193 --> 00:50:10,486
I don't know nothing, Mr Andrews.

757
00:50:10,653 --> 00:50:12,655
All niggers don't know
nothing. Where's Jesse Hunter?

758
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,490
Mr Purdy. Mr Purdy.

759
00:50:14,698 --> 00:50:17,660
You a Mason. You
got to believe me.

760
00:50:17,827 --> 00:50:19,537
I don't know no Jesse Hunter.

761
00:50:19,703 --> 00:50:23,165
Yeah, you do, you damn nigger.

762
00:50:31,882 --> 00:50:33,050
Come on, let him go.

763
00:50:33,217 --> 00:50:35,219
Come on. Hold it. Come on.

764
00:50:35,386 --> 00:50:37,680
He's not against you.
Stop it. Stop it.

765
00:50:37,847 --> 00:50:39,890
You shut up and get away.

766
00:50:40,099 --> 00:50:41,642
Sam. Get up.

767
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:44,061
Talk now.

768
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:46,230
Talk to me, Sam.

769
00:50:46,397 --> 00:50:47,815
Talk to me.

770
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:50,484
Better say something.

771
00:50:50,651 --> 00:50:52,069
As...

772
00:50:52,236 --> 00:50:55,364
as God is my witness,

773
00:50:55,531 --> 00:50:56,532
I don't know...

774
00:50:56,699 --> 00:50:58,242
Jesse Hunter.

775
00:50:58,451 --> 00:51:00,828
It was that drifter. That
rich nigger from the auction.

776
00:51:00,995 --> 00:51:05,708
That big buck with the
black horse, is that him?

777
00:51:10,004 --> 00:51:11,881
Come on, let him talk.

778
00:51:12,047 --> 00:51:14,550
Damn you.

779
00:51:14,717 --> 00:51:16,761
Look at me.

780
00:51:16,927 --> 00:51:19,847
Aaron told us you gave him a ride.

781
00:51:20,014 --> 00:51:22,099
Now you show me where
you put him out.

782
00:51:22,308 --> 00:51:25,227
Show me, Sam. I can
get you out of here.

783
00:51:25,394 --> 00:51:27,188
Show me, boy.

784
00:51:27,354 --> 00:51:28,354
You going to show me?

785
00:51:28,355 --> 00:51:29,355
We going to string you up.

786
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,192
Let's go. Get up.

787
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:32,693
Let's go. Get up.

788
00:51:35,362 --> 00:51:37,239
If we don't pick up his
trail where you say,

789
00:51:37,406 --> 00:51:39,658
you one dead black son of a bitch.

790
00:51:42,828 --> 00:51:44,789
What you got, Earl?

791
00:51:45,831 --> 00:51:46,957
Nothing, Ellis.

792
00:51:47,124 --> 00:51:48,501
Nothing?

793
00:51:54,465 --> 00:51:56,383
You can kill me...

794
00:51:57,718 --> 00:51:59,345
but you all...

795
00:51:59,512 --> 00:52:00,763
you can't eat me.

796
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:03,390
You ain't no Seminole, boy.

797
00:52:04,975 --> 00:52:06,727
Duke.

798
00:52:06,894 --> 00:52:08,729
Get back. Get back.

799
00:52:08,896 --> 00:52:10,981
Damn it, Duke.

800
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:12,190
What'd you do that for?

801
00:52:12,358 --> 00:52:13,358
Goddamn, Duke.

802
00:52:13,484 --> 00:52:15,820
Dumb son of a bitch.

803
00:52:15,986 --> 00:52:18,072
You could've killed me.

804
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:19,406
He's sure dead.

805
00:52:19,573 --> 00:52:21,575
He ain't dead.

806
00:52:21,742 --> 00:52:24,578
Well, let's clean this mess up.

807
00:52:27,248 --> 00:52:28,541
Hang him up in this
tree over here.

808
00:52:31,335 --> 00:52:33,212
Ok, men, I've had enough of this.

809
00:52:33,379 --> 00:52:35,005
I'm the law here, you hear me?

810
00:52:35,172 --> 00:52:36,173
Let me in here.

811
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:37,508
Back off now.

812
00:52:37,675 --> 00:52:38,801
Let me in there.

813
00:52:41,637 --> 00:52:43,722
Stop it, you all. Stop it.

814
00:52:43,889 --> 00:52:46,725
A white woman was
beat and raped...

815
00:52:46,892 --> 00:52:48,227
by a coloured boy.

816
00:52:48,394 --> 00:52:50,688
Now, you want to tell her
husband, her children,

817
00:52:50,896 --> 00:52:54,316
that this boy don't
have to pay for that?

818
00:52:55,901 --> 00:52:57,570
I'm supposed to uphold the law.

819
00:52:57,736 --> 00:52:58,821
Aw, law.

820
00:52:58,988 --> 00:53:00,489
Whose law, nigger law?

821
00:53:00,656 --> 00:53:02,533
You wasn't nothing but a
damn chicken farmer...

822
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:05,077
till they gave you
that stupid badge.

823
00:53:05,244 --> 00:53:06,829
You want to get re-elected?

824
00:53:06,996 --> 00:53:08,914
You want to get re-elected?

825
00:53:09,081 --> 00:53:11,125
- Leave me alone.
- Then leave it be.

826
00:53:15,546 --> 00:53:17,381
I got your watch, Sam Carter.

827
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:19,008
I got your watch.

828
00:53:37,318 --> 00:53:39,528
You're always so gentle.

829
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:43,741
Soft touch.

830
00:53:45,618 --> 00:53:47,995
You treat me like I'm
some kind of angel.

831
00:53:48,162 --> 00:53:50,998
You are an angel to me.

832
00:53:51,165 --> 00:53:53,084
I'm just a woman, James.

833
00:53:54,543 --> 00:53:55,961
I'm just a woman.

834
00:53:57,922 --> 00:54:01,509
Things are getting crazy
out there, Fanny.

835
00:54:01,675 --> 00:54:03,094
They're likely to get worse.

836
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:04,845
Sam Carter's lynched already.

837
00:54:05,012 --> 00:54:07,056
The blacksmith?

838
00:54:07,223 --> 00:54:08,223
What'd he do?

839
00:54:08,224 --> 00:54:10,351
He give that nigger a ride.

840
00:54:10,518 --> 00:54:12,478
A ride?

841
00:54:13,771 --> 00:54:15,189
Sam Carter?

842
00:54:16,941 --> 00:54:18,400
I didn't know.

843
00:54:30,663 --> 00:54:33,290
There's things that I
ought to tell you.

844
00:54:38,129 --> 00:54:39,797
Evening, Mr Taylor.

845
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,718
With all that's going
on and everything,

846
00:54:44,885 --> 00:54:47,179
we thought you all could
use some hot cooking.

847
00:54:49,515 --> 00:54:51,600
Thank you kindly, ladies, but
my wife ain't feeling too well.

848
00:54:51,767 --> 00:54:53,727
It's all right, James.

849
00:54:55,062 --> 00:54:57,273
Evening, Miss Walker.

850
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,024
Oh, Fanny...

851
00:54:59,191 --> 00:55:02,153
you poor child.

852
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:05,656
Oh, I brought you a quilt, too.

853
00:55:05,823 --> 00:55:07,283
I brought you sweetbread.

854
00:55:08,742 --> 00:55:11,328
Don't you worry. That
nigger going to be dead...

855
00:55:11,537 --> 00:55:13,789
before you finish your pie, ok?

856
00:55:38,522 --> 00:55:39,982
Get a waggon.

857
00:56:21,315 --> 00:56:25,986
Now, me and Mr Mann just cut
Sam Carter out a damn tree.

858
00:56:26,153 --> 00:56:27,488
You all hear me?

859
00:56:27,655 --> 00:56:30,407
Dirty, low-down bastards...

860
00:56:30,574 --> 00:56:32,201
took my boy.

861
00:56:32,409 --> 00:56:34,036
They got my cousin
Aaron over in jail.

862
00:56:34,203 --> 00:56:36,038
There's Sumner behind
this business.

863
00:56:36,205 --> 00:56:37,405
They say it's for
his own protection.

864
00:56:37,581 --> 00:56:39,750
Now how that sound?

865
00:56:39,959 --> 00:56:42,378
What we need to do, we need
to pray. Now, dear Lord...

866
00:56:42,545 --> 00:56:44,755
I ain't in no praying
mood, preacher.

867
00:56:44,922 --> 00:56:46,507
Now, what I want to
know is right now,

868
00:56:46,674 --> 00:56:49,260
what you all men prepared to
do if they run back here?

869
00:56:49,468 --> 00:56:52,972
Not if, Sylvester. When.

870
00:56:53,139 --> 00:56:54,265
I'm going to shoot.

871
00:56:54,432 --> 00:56:56,517
Come on, sit down now, Big Baby.

872
00:57:03,899 --> 00:57:05,776
You by yourself there, Mr Wright?

873
00:57:05,943 --> 00:57:07,361
I am, Sylvester.

874
00:57:11,532 --> 00:57:14,285
Sylvester, them
crackers so riled up,

875
00:57:14,452 --> 00:57:15,619
we don't know what
they going to do.

876
00:57:15,703 --> 00:57:17,121
They don't know what
they going to do.

877
00:57:17,329 --> 00:57:19,290
That's how a lynch mob be.

878
00:57:21,167 --> 00:57:23,919
Now, I say we send the
women and children...

879
00:57:24,086 --> 00:57:26,380
to Gainesville right now.

880
00:57:26,547 --> 00:57:28,799
John, we can't go nowhere
and leave that boy in jail.

881
00:57:29,008 --> 00:57:31,218
No. Them dirty bastards...

882
00:57:31,385 --> 00:57:33,721
can take my boy out
of that jail...

883
00:57:33,888 --> 00:57:36,432
and hang him whenever
they take a notion.

884
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:37,850
Don't worry about it, Uncle.

885
00:57:38,017 --> 00:57:40,227
We ain't going nowhere.

886
00:57:40,394 --> 00:57:42,229
We ain't going nowhere, Bradley.

887
00:57:42,396 --> 00:57:44,231
Now, we own this here land.

888
00:57:44,398 --> 00:57:46,317
We pay taxes on it.

889
00:57:46,484 --> 00:57:47,985
Now, we don't bother
nobody around here.

890
00:57:48,152 --> 00:57:50,029
We keep to ourselves.

891
00:57:50,196 --> 00:57:52,072
Now, coloured folk just can't
be running all the time.

892
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:53,739
There comes a time when
you got to stand up...

893
00:57:53,741 --> 00:57:54,742
and defend your rights.

894
00:57:54,909 --> 00:57:57,078
Sylvester. Sylvester. Listen
to me. And you listen.

895
00:57:57,244 --> 00:57:58,496
Hold on there for a minute.

896
00:57:58,662 --> 00:58:00,029
We got to think about
these here children.

897
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:01,791
Oh, I am thinking about
the children, preacher.

898
00:58:01,999 --> 00:58:05,044
Now, you suppose they
thinking about our children?

899
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:13,552
Mr Mann.

900
00:58:16,889 --> 00:58:20,017
If there be some trouble
around here, sir,

901
00:58:20,184 --> 00:58:22,103
we could sure use your help.

902
00:58:22,269 --> 00:58:25,147
I just came from one war, friend.

903
00:58:25,314 --> 00:58:27,191
I ain't looking for another one.

904
00:58:27,399 --> 00:58:29,276
Let him go, Sylvester.

905
00:58:29,443 --> 00:58:30,778
For all we know, he
could have been...

906
00:58:30,945 --> 00:58:32,029
the one that done this thing.

907
00:58:32,196 --> 00:58:34,490
They said it was... they said
it was a stranger anyhow.

908
00:58:34,698 --> 00:58:36,951
You're talking crazy
now, preacher.

909
00:58:42,331 --> 00:58:44,834
I wish you all luck.

910
00:58:53,926 --> 00:58:55,344
He ain't done nothing.

911
00:58:55,511 --> 00:58:57,430
What was that, Aunt Sarah?

912
00:59:00,558 --> 00:59:04,854
Mr Wright, would you
kindly excuse us, sir?

913
00:59:16,198 --> 00:59:17,908
I seen his face.

914
00:59:18,117 --> 00:59:19,910
He was white as butter.

915
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:22,455
What?

916
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:29,837
This what they teach
you in the Army?

917
00:59:30,004 --> 00:59:33,340
Pack up and run when
things get hot?

918
00:59:33,507 --> 00:59:34,884
Thank God the Navy don't let in...

919
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:39,555
What? Go on and say it, Mr Wright.

920
00:59:39,764 --> 00:59:42,892
Thank God the Navy
don't let in niggers.

921
00:59:44,477 --> 00:59:46,562
I was going to say cowards.

922
00:59:46,729 --> 00:59:48,606
That's right. I got
you figured, Mann.

923
00:59:48,773 --> 00:59:50,149
You one of them loud
boys, big talk.

924
00:59:50,316 --> 00:59:51,783
Figure you can say
anything to a white man...

925
00:59:51,942 --> 00:59:54,278
as long as you start out saying,
"With all due respect."

926
00:59:54,445 --> 00:59:56,906
First sign of trouble, you
ducking your head running.

927
00:59:57,072 --> 00:59:58,574
What you going to do...

928
00:59:58,741 --> 01:00:00,576
when that mob come down the road?

929
01:00:00,743 --> 01:00:03,621
You going to grab up your
rifle, defend coloured folk?

930
01:00:03,829 --> 01:00:05,039
What you care?

931
01:00:05,206 --> 01:00:08,042
Man does what he has
to. Ain't that right?

932
01:00:08,209 --> 01:00:09,676
Just like a coloured boy
back from the war...

933
01:00:09,794 --> 01:00:11,170
with a pocketful of money.

934
01:00:11,337 --> 01:00:13,422
Ain't that right?

935
01:00:13,589 --> 01:00:16,008
You the Massa of Rosewood, huh?

936
01:00:16,175 --> 01:00:17,175
Say, boy...

937
01:00:17,301 --> 01:00:18,636
these people know me.

938
01:00:18,803 --> 01:00:20,346
They trust me.

939
01:00:26,894 --> 01:00:29,271
How long you live here, Mr Wright?

940
01:00:29,438 --> 01:00:31,315
Nine years.

941
01:00:34,985 --> 01:00:37,863
I been in Rosewood one night...

942
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:40,699
they asking me to stay.

943
01:00:40,866 --> 01:00:43,452
Now, you pack up your truck...

944
01:00:43,661 --> 01:00:46,497
see who tries to stop
you from leaving.

945
01:01:08,519 --> 01:01:09,586
You wasn't going to say nothing.

946
01:01:09,645 --> 01:01:11,021
You was just going to leave me?

947
01:01:11,188 --> 01:01:13,649
Three, four weeks,
this all blow over.

948
01:01:13,816 --> 01:01:15,109
Then I come back.

949
01:01:15,276 --> 01:01:17,653
But I thought we...

950
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:20,823
Why, I didn't think you was
just going to run off, is all.

951
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:21,990
Ain't you a soldier?

952
01:01:22,032 --> 01:01:23,032
Scrappie.

953
01:01:28,789 --> 01:01:30,332
Them boys looking for
a coloured man...

954
01:01:30,499 --> 01:01:32,835
ain't nobody seen
around here before.

955
01:01:33,002 --> 01:01:34,102
Now, ain't no way in the world...

956
01:01:34,211 --> 01:01:36,672
one man got enough bullets
for all them crackers.

957
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:38,507
Your own preacher
ready to serve me up.

958
01:01:38,674 --> 01:01:41,594
But if I stay, I'm
asking to be hung.

959
01:01:48,851 --> 01:01:49,894
Look here.

960
01:02:06,118 --> 01:02:08,746
They give me this
for saving lives.

961
01:02:11,415 --> 01:02:14,460
Most important thing
anybody ever give to me.

962
01:02:14,627 --> 01:02:17,338
You keep it for me.

963
01:02:18,881 --> 01:02:21,801
Hold on to it till I get back.

964
01:02:23,094 --> 01:02:25,596
Now, can you do that
for me, darling?

965
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:01,358
Morning, Judge.

966
01:04:22,379 --> 01:04:25,883
Multiple gunshot wounds.

967
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:28,052
Missing ear...

968
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:30,721
fingers...

969
01:04:32,223 --> 01:04:35,559
various other parts.

970
01:04:35,726 --> 01:04:40,773
By Jesus, your boys really
got to this one, huh, Ellis?

971
01:04:44,693 --> 01:04:47,071
Yes, they did, sir.

972
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:56,497
Levy County is growing.

973
01:04:56,664 --> 01:04:58,290
We need us a sheriff up here...

974
01:04:58,457 --> 01:05:00,459
who can handle these
nigger problems.

975
01:05:03,003 --> 01:05:04,672
Is that you, Ellis?

976
01:05:04,839 --> 01:05:06,382
Now hold on, Judge.

977
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:10,636
Oh, I think I got everything
under control now, Judge.

978
01:05:10,803 --> 01:05:11,971
I hope so.

979
01:05:12,138 --> 01:05:13,639
We ain't talking about...

980
01:05:13,764 --> 01:05:15,975
breaking up fights
on Saturday night.

981
01:05:16,142 --> 01:05:17,309
You can't control your coloured,

982
01:05:17,476 --> 01:05:20,229
we're going to replace you
with someone who can.

983
01:05:20,396 --> 01:05:21,396
Cause of death:

984
01:05:21,439 --> 01:05:23,941
"Mischief at hands unknown..."

985
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:26,068
Write that down, Earl.

986
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:28,904
All right now. Get on in here.

987
01:05:29,071 --> 01:05:30,281
Fall in here, everybody.

988
01:05:30,489 --> 01:05:33,617
Now, hush up.

989
01:05:33,784 --> 01:05:36,746
Everybody, come on,
now. Don't lollygag.

990
01:05:36,912 --> 01:05:39,498
I want to give you a day off.

991
01:05:39,665 --> 01:05:40,750
What's that, Boots?

992
01:05:42,084 --> 01:05:43,919
He says you got the day off.

993
01:05:44,128 --> 01:05:45,254
All right.

994
01:05:45,463 --> 01:05:47,423
That coloured boy what
assaulted Fanny Taylor,

995
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:49,592
he's still out there somewhere.

996
01:05:49,759 --> 01:05:51,177
So I'm gonna give
you the day off...

997
01:05:51,343 --> 01:05:53,304
so you can go help
with the search.

998
01:05:53,471 --> 01:05:55,848
All I expect is...

999
01:05:56,015 --> 01:05:57,725
if you find him...

1000
01:05:57,892 --> 01:05:59,518
well, you know what to do.

1001
01:06:15,699 --> 01:06:16,908
Oh, Lord, Auntie,

1002
01:06:17,075 --> 01:06:19,327
they're likely to come
in here and kill us all.

1003
01:06:19,494 --> 01:06:22,039
You got to tell them
that man was white.

1004
01:06:22,205 --> 01:06:23,540
Child, you don't think...

1005
01:06:23,707 --> 01:06:25,751
they going to listen
to old Aunt Sarah?

1006
01:06:25,917 --> 01:06:28,754
They'd just as soon
as string me up...

1007
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,589
like they done Sam Carter.

1008
01:06:30,756 --> 01:06:35,552
You ain't never seen
crackers act the way I know.

1009
01:06:35,719 --> 01:06:39,222
When I was a little girl, about 7,

1010
01:06:39,389 --> 01:06:43,602
still on the Willowbrook
plantation...

1011
01:06:43,769 --> 01:06:50,317
old Massa's son stole $20
out of the family chest...

1012
01:06:50,484 --> 01:06:53,570
for a cockfight.

1013
01:06:53,737 --> 01:06:55,655
Massa knew he took it.

1014
01:06:55,822 --> 01:07:00,285
As blue as Jesus' eyes, he knew.

1015
01:07:00,494 --> 01:07:04,122
But just the same...

1016
01:07:04,289 --> 01:07:08,418
he whipped my daddy half to death.

1017
01:07:10,837 --> 01:07:15,425
It don't matter what man was
beating on Fanny Taylor.

1018
01:07:15,592 --> 01:07:17,719
Nigger.

1019
01:07:17,886 --> 01:07:20,263
It's just another word for guilty.

1020
01:07:25,852 --> 01:07:27,020
Here you go.

1021
01:07:27,187 --> 01:07:28,230
Thank you, Mr Bryce.

1022
01:07:28,397 --> 01:07:29,731
You're welcome.

1023
01:07:29,898 --> 01:07:32,359
You're a nice gentleman.

1024
01:07:34,277 --> 01:07:37,280
Look, why don't you get your
peoples on board, Aunt Sarah?

1025
01:07:37,489 --> 01:07:39,074
Take them up to
Gainesville for a while.

1026
01:07:39,241 --> 01:07:40,909
Don't much like the looks
of things around here.

1027
01:07:41,076 --> 01:07:42,119
Things been looking the same...

1028
01:07:42,285 --> 01:07:45,330
as long as I can
remember, Mr Bryce.

1029
01:07:50,168 --> 01:07:51,837
You take care of yourself.

1030
01:07:55,215 --> 01:07:56,466
Take that.

1031
01:07:56,633 --> 01:07:57,884
Put it on the side there.

1032
01:07:58,051 --> 01:07:59,261
Board.

1033
01:08:15,235 --> 01:08:16,570
Sylvester?

1034
01:08:16,737 --> 01:08:18,697
- Go inside the depot, Mama.
- Sylvester.

1035
01:08:18,864 --> 01:08:20,073
Mama, it's all right.

1036
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,240
Mama, go on.

1037
01:08:21,408 --> 01:08:23,035
Johnny.

1038
01:08:23,243 --> 01:08:24,369
Sylvester.

1039
01:08:24,578 --> 01:08:26,538
Do you know the whereabouts
of this Jesse Hunter?

1040
01:08:26,747 --> 01:08:28,415
I do not.

1041
01:08:28,582 --> 01:08:30,417
You arrest that man who
kill Sam Carter yet?

1042
01:08:30,584 --> 01:08:32,961
Don't you get uppity with me.

1043
01:08:33,128 --> 01:08:34,838
I've come to warn you.

1044
01:08:35,005 --> 01:08:36,406
There are some boys
over there in Sumner...

1045
01:08:36,407 --> 01:08:37,674
let on if they was you,

1046
01:08:37,841 --> 01:08:39,801
they wouldn't let sundown
catch them around here.

1047
01:08:39,968 --> 01:08:43,138
Well, they ain't me... sir.

1048
01:08:47,267 --> 01:08:48,393
Why don't you be a good boy...

1049
01:08:48,602 --> 01:08:50,395
and go visit some of
your other relatives...

1050
01:08:50,562 --> 01:08:51,855
for a little while, huh?

1051
01:08:53,607 --> 01:08:56,109
I am trying to help you here.

1052
01:08:57,611 --> 01:08:59,738
They're all over there right now
getting all full of liquor...

1053
01:08:59,905 --> 01:09:02,324
and making nooses.

1054
01:09:03,325 --> 01:09:05,660
You hear me. Huh?

1055
01:09:05,827 --> 01:09:07,371
Sheriff...

1056
01:09:07,579 --> 01:09:08,830
If you really want to help...

1057
01:09:08,997 --> 01:09:10,297
I appreciate it if you
wouldn't allow...

1058
01:09:10,374 --> 01:09:13,335
them boys to come around here.

1059
01:09:13,502 --> 01:09:16,088
Now, I was born and
raised in Rosewood.

1060
01:09:16,296 --> 01:09:17,297
This here is my home.

1061
01:09:17,464 --> 01:09:20,675
And I'll be damned if I let
anybody run me off it.

1062
01:09:22,344 --> 01:09:24,179
Now, you can tell them boys that.

1063
01:09:27,182 --> 01:09:29,935
Tell them your damn self.

1064
01:09:32,437 --> 01:09:35,315
Damn coloured fool.

1065
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:46,118
Go home, Mama.

1066
01:09:53,083 --> 01:09:54,484
You're gonna have to
settle your account...

1067
01:09:54,485 --> 01:09:56,779
before I can sell you the shells.

1068
01:10:00,882 --> 01:10:02,676
Want me to settle the account?

1069
01:10:02,843 --> 01:10:04,386
That's right.

1070
01:10:05,554 --> 01:10:07,139
All right.

1071
01:10:08,682 --> 01:10:11,393
Go home, Jewel.

1072
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:17,524
Girl, you best get
out of this store.

1073
01:10:17,691 --> 01:10:19,026
She belongs here. She
belongs right here.

1074
01:10:19,192 --> 01:10:21,319
Do you see how you do my cousin?

1075
01:10:21,486 --> 01:10:24,156
Get out this store
right now, Jewel. Get.

1076
01:10:26,074 --> 01:10:27,451
Can't you listen to nobody?

1077
01:10:27,617 --> 01:10:30,078
Sheriff give you good advice.
Why ain't you leaving?

1078
01:10:30,245 --> 01:10:32,247
I thought you a smart
boy, Sylvester.

1079
01:10:32,414 --> 01:10:33,665
I thought you a smart boy.

1080
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:37,002
Here is your money, Mr Wright.

1081
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:40,380
That should settle my account.

1082
01:10:40,547 --> 01:10:41,840
Sylvester...

1083
01:10:42,007 --> 01:10:44,217
Dumb...

1084
01:10:44,384 --> 01:10:45,385
Hurry up.

1085
01:10:50,599 --> 01:10:52,601
Here come them boys.

1086
01:10:57,105 --> 01:10:58,190
They ain't got nothing.

1087
01:10:59,107 --> 01:11:00,442
What'd you find?

1088
01:11:00,609 --> 01:11:02,152
Snakes and ticks.

1089
01:11:02,361 --> 01:11:05,113
Them coloured folks got
to be hiding that nigger.

1090
01:11:07,115 --> 01:11:08,450
What time is it, anyway?

1091
01:11:08,617 --> 01:11:12,621
Well, let's see...
by old Sam Carter.

1092
01:11:14,623 --> 01:11:17,125
Bourbon time.

1093
01:11:19,378 --> 01:11:21,338
I'll tell you, boys.

1094
01:11:21,505 --> 01:11:23,090
If anybody's hiding Jesse Hunter,

1095
01:11:23,256 --> 01:11:25,133
my money's on Sylvester Carrier.

1096
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:27,386
That nigger, he hates
us white folk.

1097
01:11:27,552 --> 01:11:28,553
He does.

1098
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,514
You know, he's got a piano.

1099
01:11:30,722 --> 01:11:33,183
A nigger with a goddamn piano.

1100
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:37,270
I've been working all my
life, I ain't got a piano.

1101
01:11:37,437 --> 01:11:39,481
You don't know how to play one.

1102
01:11:39,648 --> 01:11:40,774
That ain't the point.

1103
01:11:40,941 --> 01:11:44,986
Old man Cummer, up in that house
of his, he's got a piano.

1104
01:11:45,153 --> 01:11:47,698
That nigger's got
one, and I don't.

1105
01:11:47,906 --> 01:11:48,906
Now, how does that look?

1106
01:11:49,074 --> 01:11:50,992
Yeah, and he's married
to that white woman.

1107
01:11:51,159 --> 01:11:52,285
Gertrude ain't white.

1108
01:11:52,452 --> 01:11:53,495
Hell, she look white.

1109
01:11:53,662 --> 01:11:54,746
Well, she ain't.

1110
01:11:54,913 --> 01:11:58,417
She's half Negress,
half-Seminole Indian.

1111
01:11:58,583 --> 01:11:59,583
He says.

1112
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:02,337
It wouldn't surprise me if
he was hiding that bastard.

1113
01:12:02,504 --> 01:12:04,089
Hey, Judge.

1114
01:12:13,223 --> 01:12:14,433
I tell you, Duke.

1115
01:12:14,599 --> 01:12:16,226
Can I get that bottle?

1116
01:12:39,833 --> 01:12:41,251
Go ahead now, make a wish.

1117
01:12:42,878 --> 01:12:44,629
Blow the candles out.

1118
01:12:51,303 --> 01:12:53,221
Open this one first,
Arnett. Open that one.

1119
01:13:03,565 --> 01:13:05,859
Oh, yeah, that's nice, Mama.

1120
01:13:06,026 --> 01:13:07,319
Yeah, that's real nice.

1121
01:13:07,486 --> 01:13:10,447
You're a man now. You
need a suit of clothes.

1122
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:25,712
Arnett, open this one
here and that one, too.

1123
01:13:25,879 --> 01:13:28,465
Sylvester got that one.

1124
01:13:40,018 --> 01:13:41,728
Simmer down. Be quiet.

1125
01:13:46,066 --> 01:13:49,236
Sylvester, come on
out here now, boy.

1126
01:13:49,403 --> 01:13:50,612
We want to talk to you.

1127
01:13:50,779 --> 01:13:53,240
Bring that Jesse Hunter
on out here with you.

1128
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:55,450
Yeah, that's right. Bring
that boy with you.

1129
01:13:55,659 --> 01:13:57,661
Jesse and Sylvester are
probably sitting up in there.

1130
01:13:57,869 --> 01:13:59,496
Shut up that damn dog.

1131
01:13:59,705 --> 01:14:02,290
Sitting up there now
eating pork chops.

1132
01:14:02,457 --> 01:14:03,917
Laughing at us all.

1133
01:14:04,084 --> 01:14:05,168
Goddamn, Duke.

1134
01:14:06,670 --> 01:14:09,131
Son of a...

1135
01:14:10,173 --> 01:14:11,341
You had no call to do that.

1136
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:12,801
It's just a damn dog, Ellis.

1137
01:14:12,968 --> 01:14:14,177
I'll have no more shooting.

1138
01:14:14,344 --> 01:14:15,711
How you expect the boy
to come out here...

1139
01:14:15,712 --> 01:14:17,055
if you're going to
shoot his hound?

1140
01:14:17,222 --> 01:14:18,890
Hell of a shot.

1141
01:14:19,057 --> 01:14:21,518
Sylvester. You'd better
get out here now.

1142
01:14:23,645 --> 01:14:25,272
Wait, Mama. Mama, hold on.

1143
01:14:26,565 --> 01:14:28,567
Get out the window, Mama.

1144
01:14:32,487 --> 01:14:34,322
All right. I'm gonna
go get the guns, Mama.

1145
01:14:34,489 --> 01:14:35,489
You stay out the window.

1146
01:14:35,615 --> 01:14:36,950
No, Sylvester.

1147
01:14:37,117 --> 01:14:38,160
Mama, just stay out the window.

1148
01:14:38,326 --> 01:14:40,454
You all children get
down right now.

1149
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:41,872
Get down under the
table right now.

1150
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,540
Scrappie, Gertie, you
keep these kids down.

1151
01:14:43,749 --> 01:14:45,625
Big Baby, get down. Get down.

1152
01:15:05,354 --> 01:15:08,023
We don't want to talk to you.
We want to talk to your boy.

1153
01:15:08,190 --> 01:15:10,067
Boys, why don't you
all go on home?

1154
01:15:10,233 --> 01:15:12,110
Miz Sarah, we want to
talk to Sylvester.

1155
01:15:12,277 --> 01:15:14,946
You get him out here. Right now.

1156
01:15:15,113 --> 01:15:18,784
Mr Walker, my boy don't know
nothing about this business.

1157
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:20,077
You let him tell us that.

1158
01:15:20,243 --> 01:15:21,828
Let Jesse Hunter
tell us something.

1159
01:15:21,995 --> 01:15:24,498
Boys, I know you all.

1160
01:15:24,664 --> 01:15:26,708
I was midwife to more
than half of you...

1161
01:15:26,875 --> 01:15:28,251
and some of your young ones.

1162
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:29,711
Bring that boy out here now.

1163
01:15:29,878 --> 01:15:33,131
I done seen you come
up from babies to now.

1164
01:15:33,298 --> 01:15:35,425
Ain't nothing going
to come of this.

1165
01:15:35,634 --> 01:15:37,677
It don't make sense.

1166
01:15:37,844 --> 01:15:40,222
My Sylvester ain't had nothing
to do with this mess.

1167
01:15:40,389 --> 01:15:45,060
We ain't never known
no Jesse Hunter.

1168
01:15:45,227 --> 01:15:47,729
I was there with Miss Fanny.

1169
01:15:47,938 --> 01:15:51,400
I seen the man's face
as plain as day.

1170
01:15:51,608 --> 01:15:54,986
And most of you men know
that that man was white.

1171
01:16:01,827 --> 01:16:03,120
Who fired that shot?

1172
01:16:03,286 --> 01:16:04,705
You tell me right now.

1173
01:16:04,871 --> 01:16:06,164
I told you no more shooting.

1174
01:16:06,331 --> 01:16:08,333
Didn't I tell you that?

1175
01:16:18,593 --> 01:16:20,053
Aunt Sarah.

1176
01:16:37,237 --> 01:16:38,363
Poly, get back here.

1177
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:39,530
Shut up, Walker.

1178
01:16:39,614 --> 01:16:40,949
Quit squealing like a stuck pig.

1179
01:16:41,116 --> 01:16:42,826
I'll take this boy out myself.

1180
01:16:43,035 --> 01:16:44,578
Damn you, get back here.

1181
01:16:56,298 --> 01:16:58,717
Pledge your souls to hell.

1182
01:17:29,289 --> 01:17:32,000
Get back under there.
Stay there. Stay down.

1183
01:17:41,593 --> 01:17:44,096
Get inside, son. Go on inside.

1184
01:17:46,807 --> 01:17:48,642
Hold your fire.

1185
01:17:48,809 --> 01:17:49,809
Hold your fire.

1186
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:50,810
Think we got him?

1187
01:17:50,894 --> 01:17:51,894
I don't know.

1188
01:17:51,895 --> 01:17:53,105
We gonna need more bullets.

1189
01:17:53,271 --> 01:17:55,907
You go and tell, tell the
judge what happened here.

1190
01:17:56,108 --> 01:17:57,818
Go.

1191
01:17:57,984 --> 01:18:02,030
Rest of you all men, get
back. Go on. Stay low.

1192
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:12,457
I'm right here.

1193
01:18:12,624 --> 01:18:14,251
I'm right here, Mama.

1194
01:18:14,459 --> 01:18:17,045
Hold on.

1195
01:18:17,212 --> 01:18:20,215
Hold on, ok, Mama? I'm right here.

1196
01:18:25,178 --> 01:18:27,639
Don't try to talk, Mama,
don't try to talk.

1197
01:18:35,147 --> 01:18:36,857
Don't...

1198
01:18:38,316 --> 01:18:42,904
Don't let them surround you, baby.

1199
01:18:43,071 --> 01:18:44,406
It's all right. I won't, Mama.

1200
01:18:44,573 --> 01:18:45,824
You just hold on, ok?

1201
01:18:45,991 --> 01:18:48,076
Mama, no, hold on.

1202
01:18:48,243 --> 01:18:50,954
Mama, hold on.

1203
01:18:51,163 --> 01:18:52,956
Mama, hold on.

1204
01:19:21,193 --> 01:19:23,236
You all take what you
need and no more.

1205
01:19:23,403 --> 01:19:25,364
You hear me?

1206
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:27,157
You all hear me?

1207
01:19:29,659 --> 01:19:31,953
How am I going to be
paid for all this?

1208
01:19:33,372 --> 01:19:35,540
You just keep track, that's all.

1209
01:19:38,418 --> 01:19:42,047
You all shoot Sylvester, Ellis?

1210
01:19:42,214 --> 01:19:43,632
Don't know.

1211
01:19:45,133 --> 01:19:47,177
They shot Aunt
Sarah, though, John.

1212
01:19:48,845 --> 01:19:50,138
Aunt Sarah.

1213
01:19:51,723 --> 01:19:53,850
What the hell's the
matter with you, Ellis?

1214
01:19:54,017 --> 01:19:55,977
You let them come here
and shoot an old woman?

1215
01:19:56,144 --> 01:19:57,562
I didn't let them do that.

1216
01:19:57,729 --> 01:19:59,815
You call that upholding the law?

1217
01:19:59,981 --> 01:20:02,025
What kind of sheriff are you?

1218
01:20:04,653 --> 01:20:08,198
Henry and Poly are dead.

1219
01:20:15,497 --> 01:20:17,999
Shot by them damn nigras.

1220
01:20:20,836 --> 01:20:23,171
Where'd Sylvester get
his ammunition, John?

1221
01:20:37,477 --> 01:20:38,478
All right, come on.

1222
01:20:38,645 --> 01:20:40,022
Come on. Hurry up. Hurry up.

1223
01:20:40,188 --> 01:20:41,523
Come on. Come on.

1224
01:20:42,566 --> 01:20:44,276
Take those babies, go
hide in the woods.

1225
01:20:44,443 --> 01:20:45,910
You all babies going to
get in the woods now.

1226
01:20:45,944 --> 01:20:47,779
Go on. Go hide in the woods.

1227
01:20:47,946 --> 01:20:50,449
Go on. Hurry up. Go
hide in the woods.

1228
01:20:50,615 --> 01:20:51,783
Sylvester, I ain't leaving you.

1229
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:53,117
Gertie, they gonna
come back here...

1230
01:20:53,118 --> 01:20:54,402
and try to kill all of us.

1231
01:20:54,403 --> 01:20:56,454
You and Scrappie got to go hide
these children in the swamp.

1232
01:20:56,455 --> 01:20:58,089
We can't take the babies
out there. It's freezing.

1233
01:20:58,206 --> 01:21:00,292
There ain't no place else.
Go on and get out of here.

1234
01:21:00,459 --> 01:21:01,459
What about Aunt Sarah?

1235
01:21:01,585 --> 01:21:03,211
Just go on and get, girl.

1236
01:21:03,378 --> 01:21:05,130
Come on. Let's go.

1237
01:21:09,926 --> 01:21:11,928
Gertie. I'll be there.

1238
01:21:12,095 --> 01:21:14,556
You got to go. You got to go.

1239
01:21:19,728 --> 01:21:21,229
Come on, Big Baby, get.

1240
01:21:23,315 --> 01:21:25,817
I can shoot, Sylvester.

1241
01:21:27,319 --> 01:21:29,613
Big Baby gonna shoot.

1242
01:21:34,034 --> 01:21:35,410
All right.

1243
01:21:37,245 --> 01:21:38,747
All right. Come on.

1244
01:21:38,914 --> 01:21:39,998
How many are there in the house?

1245
01:21:40,165 --> 01:21:42,959
Sylvester, Jesse
Hunter, James Carrier.

1246
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,336
Probably that drifter.

1247
01:21:44,503 --> 01:21:46,004
Yeah, Rodney. Listen.

1248
01:21:46,171 --> 01:21:47,631
You get together all the
men you can find...

1249
01:21:47,798 --> 01:21:49,257
and you hightail it to Sumner.

1250
01:21:49,424 --> 01:21:50,926
Now, you make sure
they bring rifles.

1251
01:21:51,093 --> 01:21:52,093
What happened?

1252
01:21:52,094 --> 01:21:53,804
Three dead white men is all.

1253
01:21:53,970 --> 01:21:57,641
We done got ourselves a goddamn
nigger revolt up here.

1254
01:22:10,445 --> 01:22:12,155
Hold your fire.

1255
01:22:14,908 --> 01:22:16,368
There he is.

1256
01:22:26,753 --> 01:22:27,754
I think I got him.

1257
01:22:27,921 --> 01:22:29,047
Hold your fire.

1258
01:22:32,801 --> 01:22:33,969
Goddamn you.

1259
01:22:34,136 --> 01:22:36,138
Burn.

1260
01:22:38,181 --> 01:22:39,891
Light 'em up.

1261
01:22:57,743 --> 01:23:01,830
Some of you all pick
Henry and Poly up.

1262
01:23:18,347 --> 01:23:19,848
That Sylvester?

1263
01:23:25,687 --> 01:23:27,147
You son of a bitch.

1264
01:24:04,851 --> 01:24:06,561
You want me to burn her, too?

1265
01:24:09,606 --> 01:24:12,317
Couple you all men,
come over here.

1266
01:24:14,486 --> 01:24:17,948
I want you all to carry her
down to the nigger graveyard.

1267
01:24:21,326 --> 01:24:23,412
Go on.

1268
01:24:23,578 --> 01:24:26,373
I'll do it if you make me deputy.

1269
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:28,625
You're deputy now.

1270
01:24:28,834 --> 01:24:30,335
Go on, pick her up.

1271
01:24:30,502 --> 01:24:33,130
Hey, boys, I'm a deputy.

1272
01:24:35,132 --> 01:24:37,092
Hold on to that now.
Grab the other side.

1273
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:39,720
Hold on, Bobby. Hold on.

1274
01:24:42,514 --> 01:24:44,474
This wasn't supposed to happen.

1275
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:49,187
She worked in my
damn house, Ellis.

1276
01:24:55,444 --> 01:24:58,113
Then give her a decent
Christian burial, James.

1277
01:25:08,957 --> 01:25:11,710
You men, grab that end.

1278
01:25:11,877 --> 01:25:14,171
Damn, what did this old crow eat?

1279
01:25:14,379 --> 01:25:16,506
Come on, lift it up.

1280
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:24,389
Look out now. Look out.

1281
01:26:11,603 --> 01:26:14,439
Aunt Sarah come in the morning.

She clean up.

1283
01:26:16,274 --> 01:26:17,275
Aunt Sarah ain't coming.

1284
01:26:18,610 --> 01:26:20,445
No. You right.

1285
01:26:21,613 --> 01:26:23,532
It's Sunday.

1286
01:26:23,699 --> 01:26:27,411
Aunt Sarah ain't coming no more.

1287
01:26:30,664 --> 01:26:32,082
No more, no never.

1288
01:26:34,584 --> 01:26:35,669
She's dead.

1289
01:26:41,133 --> 01:26:43,635
Sylvester, too, dead as hell.

1290
01:26:47,139 --> 01:26:48,432
Sam Carter.

1291
01:26:53,645 --> 01:26:54,980
Half of Rosewood's dead,

1292
01:26:55,147 --> 01:26:58,150
and they ain't caught
your nigger yet.

1293
01:26:59,609 --> 01:27:01,820
Sarah...

1294
01:27:03,030 --> 01:27:04,948
Sarah...

1295
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:10,912
Why they hurt that old woman?

1296
01:27:13,165 --> 01:27:15,792
She never done nothing to nobody.

1297

raped a white girl.

01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,200
Yeah, them niggers need
to be put in their place.

1316
01:29:03,817 --> 01:29:04,943
Right over there.

1317
01:29:05,110 --> 01:29:06,445
There he is. Get him.

1318
01:29:06,611 --> 01:29:08,071
On that horse. Give me my gun.

1319
01:29:27,841 --> 01:29:30,886
Jesse. You were better off
on that chain gang, boy.

1320
01:29:31,053 --> 01:29:32,471
There he is.

1321
01:29:46,818 --> 01:29:49,071
Let's go, boys. Come on. Get him.

1322
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,160
Move it.

1323
01:29:56,328 --> 01:29:57,788
Let's get out of here.

1324
01:30:08,215 --> 01:30:09,549
Drop that gun.

1325
01:30:09,716 --> 01:30:11,259
Get them horses out of here.

1326
01:30:11,426 --> 01:30:13,637
Hey, you hold that horse down.

1327
01:30:13,804 --> 01:30:15,180
Now, get him on over there.

1328
01:30:15,347 --> 01:30:17,182
Go on.

1329
01:30:17,349 --> 01:30:18,850
Oh, Ellis, let 'em run.

1330
01:30:19,017 --> 01:30:20,977
Let 'em run. Howdy-do.

1331
01:30:27,192 --> 01:30:28,652
Ooh, here come the parade.

1332
01:30:31,822 --> 01:30:34,783
Hey, listen up. Come
on. Come on over here.

1333
01:30:34,991 --> 01:30:35,991
Come on.

1334
01:30:36,159 --> 01:30:39,037
15 niggers jumped us in the woods.

1335
01:30:39,204 --> 01:30:40,872
They was armed to the teeth.

1336
01:30:41,039 --> 01:30:43,166
What? They bump you in the head?

1337
01:30:43,333 --> 01:30:44,334
Sure enough did.

1338
01:30:44,501 --> 01:30:45,502
You go on and get them, then.

1339
01:30:45,711 --> 01:30:46,711
Let's all get 'em.

1340
01:30:46,712 --> 01:30:48,296
- Was it back there?
- Back yonder.

1341
01:30:48,463 --> 01:30:50,340
Go now.

1342
01:30:57,055 --> 01:30:59,891
Hey, Ellis, you got a
phone call, Ellis.

1343
01:31:00,058 --> 01:31:02,477
Not now, Earl.

1344
01:31:02,644 --> 01:31:04,479
It's the governor, Ellis.

1345
01:31:09,067 --> 01:31:10,986
Pretty exciting stuff, huh, Ellis?

1346
01:31:23,749 --> 01:31:25,709
Go right inside, Timothy.

1347
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:36,303
See the nigger? They got him.

1348
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:37,679
No. You've got to look and see.

1349
01:31:37,888 --> 01:31:39,306
You've got to remember this.

1350
01:31:39,473 --> 01:31:41,058
It's something you've
got to remember. Look.

1351
01:32:05,999 --> 01:32:08,126
What? What?

1352
01:32:16,635 --> 01:32:19,971
Mr Wright, you have to hide me.

1353
01:32:20,138 --> 01:32:21,973
You are crazy.

1354
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:23,475
I can't run.

1355
01:32:23,642 --> 01:32:26,978
Mr Wright, I don't know
where my boys are,

1356
01:32:27,145 --> 01:32:30,482
and my baby girl is somewhere...

1357
01:32:30,649 --> 01:32:32,317
in the woods.

1358
01:32:35,654 --> 01:32:36,988
Mr Wright...

1359
01:32:38,990 --> 01:32:41,451
they killed my Virginia.

1360
01:32:47,666 --> 01:32:49,751
They find you here,
they'll burn my store.

1361
01:32:49,918 --> 01:32:52,045
You best run hide in the woods.

1362
01:32:52,212 --> 01:32:54,297
I can't run.

1363
01:32:54,506 --> 01:32:58,093
I got shot through my side.

1364
01:33:02,931 --> 01:33:05,475
I can pay you.

1365
01:33:14,651 --> 01:33:17,404
We'll put you in the
back storeroom.

1366
01:33:17,571 --> 01:33:18,989
Thank you.

1367
01:33:19,156 --> 01:33:21,992
We'll talk about that
deed later, Bradley.

1368
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:24,161
God bless you, John Wright.

1369
01:33:30,125 --> 01:33:33,003
Get some clean white
rags, blanket.

1370
01:33:42,679 --> 01:33:44,014
Here they come.

1371
01:33:44,181 --> 01:33:46,016
What are you fellas
doing in the road?

1372
01:33:46,183 --> 01:33:47,183
Hold steady, boys.

1373
01:33:47,184 --> 01:33:48,643
You can back up right now.

1374
01:33:48,852 --> 01:33:50,020
Move them trucks out.

1375
01:33:50,187 --> 01:33:51,646
Come on.

1376
01:33:53,065 --> 01:33:55,192
You know what to do now.

1377
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:56,943
We got business to take care of.

1378
01:33:57,110 --> 01:33:58,110
Ok, now...

1379
01:33:58,153 --> 01:33:59,196
Get them trucks out the road.

1380
01:33:59,404 --> 01:34:01,239
- Turn around.
- What are you boys doing?

1381
01:34:01,406 --> 01:34:02,473
You need to get on out the road.

1382
01:34:02,574 --> 01:34:03,975
We got business to take
care of over there.

1383
01:34:03,992 --> 01:34:04,993
Turn around.

1384
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:07,120
You ain't bringing all
this into our town.

1385
01:34:07,287 --> 01:34:08,622
Oh, yeah, we are.

1386
01:34:08,789 --> 01:34:12,167
We're looking for a coloured
fugitive name of Jesse Hunter.

1387
01:34:12,334 --> 01:34:13,960
Our coloureds are
law-abiding folk.

1388
01:34:14,127 --> 01:34:15,837
Bronson don't want you.

1389
01:34:16,004 --> 01:34:17,047
Now turn around.

1390
01:34:19,257 --> 01:34:20,884
What are you all going
down on us for?

1391
01:34:21,051 --> 01:34:23,387
You all gonna protect niggers?

1392
01:34:23,553 --> 01:34:25,972
That ain't no way to
treat a white man.

1393
01:34:26,139 --> 01:34:27,641
Oh, hell, he ain't here.

1394
01:34:27,808 --> 01:34:30,477
I'm gonna remember this.

1395
01:34:36,983 --> 01:34:39,069
Now, go on in there with them.

1396
01:34:41,154 --> 01:34:42,489
Ready?

1397
01:35:20,110 --> 01:35:21,110
Hey, Bobby.

1398
01:35:21,236 --> 01:35:22,946
Hey, we're going back
over. You coming?

1399
01:35:23,155 --> 01:35:24,489
Yeah. I'll be along in a bit.

1400
01:35:24,656 --> 01:35:25,991
You save me some.

1401
01:35:26,158 --> 01:35:28,994
Them niggers, they running
like chicken, boy.

1402
01:35:29,161 --> 01:35:31,663
They in the swamp now.
We're gonna get 'em.

1403
01:36:03,695 --> 01:36:05,489
Them's church bells.

1404
01:36:05,655 --> 01:36:07,657
My daddy's ringing 'em.

1405
01:36:07,866 --> 01:36:09,033
Them crackers be
ringing them bells.

1406
01:36:09,159 --> 01:36:10,744
Now, you stay put, you hear?

1407
01:36:10,911 --> 01:36:13,622
No. That's my daddy in his church.

1408
01:36:13,789 --> 01:36:15,248
He telling us it's
safe to come home.

1409
01:36:15,415 --> 01:36:16,750
No, Denny, Lee Ruth...

1410
01:36:16,917 --> 01:36:18,335
Maybelle.

1411
01:36:18,502 --> 01:36:19,669
Denny, come back here.

1412
01:36:19,836 --> 01:36:21,088
Denny, no. Come back here.

1413
01:36:24,424 --> 01:36:26,134
Bust it up, boys.

1414
01:36:28,762 --> 01:36:30,597
Bust it all up, now.

1415
01:36:30,764 --> 01:36:32,557
Bust it all up.

1416
01:36:46,238 --> 01:36:48,240
Niggers.

1417
01:37:02,921 --> 01:37:04,172
Come on. Git.

1418
01:37:26,153 --> 01:37:28,655
That's a fire, now, ain't it?

1419
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:35,037
Well, look, this come
out perfect here.

1420
01:37:35,203 --> 01:37:36,496
13.

1421
01:37:36,663 --> 01:37:37,998
Then you pull that
through there, see?

1422
01:37:38,165 --> 01:37:40,667
Now, you pull on one of those.

1423
01:37:40,834 --> 01:37:41,918
That's perfect. That's good.

1424
01:37:42,085 --> 01:37:43,462
There you go. Pull tight.

1425
01:37:43,628 --> 01:37:45,464
There you go. That's good.

1426
01:37:45,630 --> 01:37:47,466
Now you've got it, boy.

1427
01:37:47,632 --> 01:37:48,967
There's your noose.

1428
01:37:49,134 --> 01:37:50,510
Now you make one.

1429
01:37:50,677 --> 01:37:52,220
Just like this one.

1430
01:38:02,647 --> 01:38:04,483
Oh, that's a good one.

1431
01:38:04,649 --> 01:38:06,610
That's a good one.

1432
01:38:07,652 --> 01:38:08,820
Good boy.

1433
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:13,658
Here. Use these and
cover yourself up.

1434
01:38:13,825 --> 01:38:16,787
It's all right. You're all right.

1435
01:38:16,995 --> 01:38:19,331
Scrappie, I'm freezing.

1436
01:38:19,498 --> 01:38:21,124
Scrappie, I'm hungry.

1437
01:38:22,959 --> 01:38:23,959
Quiet, you all.

1438
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:25,629
They're gonna hear us.

1439
01:38:52,155 --> 01:38:54,616
They done killed everybody.

1440
01:38:54,783 --> 01:38:56,702
Aunt Sarah, Big Baby, Sylvester.

1441
01:38:56,868 --> 01:38:58,495
Scrappie.

1442
01:39:04,209 --> 01:39:05,419
Look.

1443
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:19,850
It's more than 50 children
hiding around in the swamp,

1444
01:39:20,017 --> 01:39:21,685
and they been out
here all night...

1445
01:39:21,852 --> 01:39:23,228
with nothing to eat,

1446
01:39:23,395 --> 01:39:25,731
and they're crying,
and they're freezing.

1447
01:39:25,897 --> 01:39:28,191
What we gonna do?
What we gonna do?

1448
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,027
You all be quiet now.

1449
01:39:30,235 --> 01:39:31,235
Now, hush.

1450
01:39:31,361 --> 01:39:33,155
Hush. Just hush.

1451
01:39:38,660 --> 01:39:40,078
Stop fighting.

1452
01:39:46,668 --> 01:39:48,336
Arnett...

1453
01:39:48,503 --> 01:39:50,005
Front and centre.

1454
01:39:55,135 --> 01:39:57,471
Quit crying, Arnett.

1455
01:39:57,637 --> 01:40:01,350
You ain't a little boy
no more. You a man.

1456
01:40:01,558 --> 01:40:04,436
Now, you see any
tears in these eyes?

1457
01:40:06,688 --> 01:40:09,483
I need you to be strong.

1458
01:40:09,649 --> 01:40:12,652
You're my lieutenant, understand?

1459
01:40:12,819 --> 01:40:13,862
Yes, sir.

1460
01:40:18,617 --> 01:40:20,702
Now, you gather up these
women and children.

1461
01:40:20,869 --> 01:40:22,954
You're gonna move
deep into the swamp.

1462
01:40:29,795 --> 01:40:30,795
All right.

1463
01:40:30,796 --> 01:40:32,964
We got to move.

1464
01:40:33,131 --> 01:40:34,299
Get up.

1465
01:40:35,884 --> 01:40:37,969
Come on. Get up.

1466
01:40:38,136 --> 01:40:39,221
Come on. Move.

1467
01:40:39,388 --> 01:40:40,472
Let's go. Move.

1468
01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:41,723
I knew you'd be back.

1469
01:40:41,890 --> 01:40:43,475
It's gonna be all right.

1470
01:40:43,642 --> 01:40:45,936
Let's move it. Get him up.

1471
01:40:46,144 --> 01:40:47,479
Oh, he's bad.

1472
01:40:47,646 --> 01:40:49,731
He ain't gonna last out here.

1473
01:40:49,898 --> 01:40:51,733
Emma, there ain't nothing
the matter with me.

1474
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:53,402
- I can walk.
- Daddy.

1475
01:40:53,610 --> 01:40:54,778
There ain't no place to go.

1476
01:40:54,986 --> 01:40:56,697
You come too late.

1477
01:40:56,863 --> 01:40:58,990
All right, Timothy.
Upstairs with the Turners.

1478
01:40:59,157 --> 01:41:00,867
Put him upstairs,
too, in the front.

1479
01:41:01,034 --> 01:41:02,369
That's enough. That's enough.

1480
01:41:02,536 --> 01:41:03,870
Let's go. Upstairs.

1481
01:41:04,037 --> 01:41:05,497
Everyone upstairs.

1482
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:07,999
And clean this place
up. Look at this.

1483
01:41:08,166 --> 01:41:09,334
Clean this up.

1484
01:41:09,501 --> 01:41:12,963
Oh, my God. This is not happening.

1485
01:41:13,130 --> 01:41:15,048
What's the matter with you?

1486
01:41:18,677 --> 01:41:20,470
I know you don't...

1487
01:41:20,679 --> 01:41:23,974
I know you don't like having
coloured folks in the house,

1488
01:41:24,141 --> 01:41:25,475
but this is a serious time.

1489
01:41:25,642 --> 01:41:27,019
Is that what you think,

1490
01:41:27,185 --> 01:41:29,980
that I don't like living here
because of the coloured folks?

1491
01:41:30,188 --> 01:41:31,314
Is that what you think?

1492
01:41:31,481 --> 01:41:32,482
Well, what is it, Mary?

1493
01:41:32,691 --> 01:41:36,278
I am caring for the
coloured folks in my home.

1494
01:41:36,445 --> 01:41:37,779
It's my home, too.

1495
01:41:37,946 --> 01:41:39,990
I know. Yes, it's your home.

1496
01:41:40,157 --> 01:41:44,995
You all treat me like a
guest in my own house.

1497
01:41:45,162 --> 01:41:48,290
I got news for you, John Wright.

1498
01:41:48,498 --> 01:41:50,167
Carol is dead.

1499
01:41:50,333 --> 01:41:56,465
She's dead. She ain't coming
back, and I ain't leaving.

1500
01:42:03,138 --> 01:42:05,057
Oh, God.

1501
01:42:11,063 --> 01:42:12,397
Put me down.

1502
01:42:12,564 --> 01:42:15,609
Put me down.

1503
01:42:15,776 --> 01:42:16,776
Emma.

1504
01:42:16,777 --> 01:42:18,570
Emma.

1505
01:42:19,738 --> 01:42:21,865
Put me down.

1506
01:42:22,032 --> 01:42:24,034
I hear you're hiding
folk, Mr Wright.

1507
01:42:24,201 --> 01:42:25,535
I need you to put
away old James here.

1508
01:42:25,702 --> 01:42:26,828
You're misinformed.

1509
01:42:26,995 --> 01:42:28,295
You best take him. Go
hide in the woods.

1510
01:42:28,372 --> 01:42:29,807
No. I don't want to go in there.

1511
01:42:29,808 --> 01:42:31,040
Take him, and go
hide in the swamp.

1512
01:42:31,041 --> 01:42:32,209
I ain't gonna go in that house.

1513
01:42:32,376 --> 01:42:34,878
- John Wright?
- What?

1514
01:42:35,087 --> 01:42:37,381
I know what you been
doing with my daughter.

1515
01:42:37,589 --> 01:42:38,589
What?

1516
01:42:38,632 --> 01:42:40,634
- Hush now.
- I can run like you.

1517
01:42:40,801 --> 01:42:42,469
No, you can't.

1518
01:42:42,636 --> 01:42:45,514
Now, you gonna get us
killed. Just hush.

1519
01:42:45,681 --> 01:42:47,015
Come on, Mr Wright.

1520
01:42:47,182 --> 01:42:48,517
You the Massa around here.

1521
01:42:48,684 --> 01:42:50,185
I ain't a Massa of nothing.

1522
01:42:50,352 --> 01:42:51,436
You best git while you can.

1523
01:42:51,603 --> 01:42:53,188
- What's the matter, Mr Wright?
- Git.

1524
01:42:53,355 --> 01:42:54,689
Don't he owe you enough
to save his life?

1525
01:42:54,690 --> 01:42:55,690
You son of a bitch.

1526
01:42:55,749 --> 01:42:57,292
How much it take for
you to hide this man?

1527
01:42:57,401 --> 01:42:59,194
$10? 15?

1528
01:42:59,361 --> 01:43:01,363
How about 60, goddamn 50?

1529
01:43:01,530 --> 01:43:02,739
I'm gonna blow your head off.

1530
01:43:02,948 --> 01:43:05,200
This man's life worth
one acre of land?

1531
01:43:05,367 --> 01:43:08,995
Hide the man, John,
for God's sake.

1532
01:43:09,162 --> 01:43:11,081
Let him in.

1533
01:43:17,671 --> 01:43:18,880
Come on.

1534
01:43:22,551 --> 01:43:23,551
Come on.

1535
01:43:23,552 --> 01:43:24,552
No, Mama.

1536
01:43:24,553 --> 01:43:25,553
Come on, baby.

1537
01:43:25,554 --> 01:43:26,763
No, Mama. It's all
right. You go on.

1538
01:43:26,930 --> 01:43:28,473
Go, Mama. I'm all right.

1539
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:33,270
I can't go in there,
Mama. Take care of Papa.

1540
01:43:33,437 --> 01:43:34,437
Come on.

1541
01:43:34,438 --> 01:43:36,982
Come on, now. Git.

1542
01:43:37,149 --> 01:43:38,149
Go.

1543
01:43:40,652 --> 01:43:42,612
I'll be all right, Mama.

1544
01:44:11,641 --> 01:44:14,186
What's the problem, boys?
What's the matter?

1545
01:44:14,353 --> 01:44:15,937
We want James Carrier.

1546
01:44:16,104 --> 01:44:17,104
Right now.

1547
01:44:17,147 --> 01:44:19,149
Well, I ain't seen him.
Hell, I ain't seen nobody.

1548
01:44:19,316 --> 01:44:20,316
Damn it, John.

1549
01:44:20,317 --> 01:44:22,819
We caught his daughter.

1550
01:44:23,028 --> 01:44:24,321
We know he's here.

1551
01:44:24,529 --> 01:44:26,823
What did you all
peckerwoods do to her?

1552
01:44:26,990 --> 01:44:28,158
Where's she at, damn it?

1553
01:44:28,325 --> 01:44:29,701
Where's she at, Ellis?

1554
01:44:31,370 --> 01:44:34,206
Come on now. It's
her daddy we after.

1555
01:44:34,373 --> 01:44:36,750
Explain to me why you
want to lynch a cripple.

1556
01:44:36,917 --> 01:44:39,461
We ain't lynching nobody don't
need to be lynched, John.

1557
01:44:39,669 --> 01:44:40,736
I just don't see no sense in it.

1558
01:44:40,879 --> 01:44:43,340
John, James Carrier
was in that house...

1559
01:44:43,548 --> 01:44:44,800
with Sylvester and Jesse Hunter.

1560
01:44:44,966 --> 01:44:48,804
Yeah. We just want to ask
him a few questions, John.

1561
01:44:48,970 --> 01:44:50,097
That's all.

1562
01:44:50,263 --> 01:44:54,518
Well, that's all fine,
but I ain't got him.

1563
01:44:54,685 --> 01:44:56,019
All right, boys.

1564
01:44:56,186 --> 01:44:57,186
Stay back.

1565
01:44:57,187 --> 01:44:59,523
You get off my
porch. Get off my...

1566
01:44:59,690 --> 01:45:01,024
Don't you come near.

1567
01:45:01,191 --> 01:45:02,359
Simmer down.

1568
01:45:02,567 --> 01:45:03,985
Johnny, you want these boys...

1569
01:45:04,152 --> 01:45:05,487
to go through your
wife and children?

1570
01:45:05,654 --> 01:45:06,988
Is that what you want?

1571
01:45:07,155 --> 01:45:08,155
Come on. Bring him out.

1572
01:45:08,198 --> 01:45:09,991
We will. That's what
we're gonna do.

1573
01:45:10,158 --> 01:45:11,993
You give me your word,

1574
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:15,580
all you want to do is
question him? Yes?

1575
01:45:19,418 --> 01:45:22,003
That's more like it.

1576
01:45:22,170 --> 01:45:23,505
You all wait here.

1577
01:45:23,672 --> 01:45:25,507
Get that nigger out here.

1578
01:45:25,674 --> 01:45:29,469
He was in the house
the whole time.

1579
01:45:29,636 --> 01:45:30,804
Get that damn nigger.

1580
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:40,981
John.

1581
01:45:41,148 --> 01:45:42,482
John, where are you going?

1582
01:45:42,649 --> 01:45:44,317
You're not going to let
those people have him?

1583
01:45:44,484 --> 01:45:45,819
Mary, please.

1584
01:45:45,986 --> 01:45:48,780
If I don't, they'll come
in here and shoot us all.

1585
01:45:48,947 --> 01:45:50,490
They just want to ask
him some questions.

1586
01:45:50,657 --> 01:45:53,952
I'll be with him to make sure
they don't do more than that.

1587
01:45:54,119 --> 01:45:55,370
I'll be with him.

1588
01:45:58,790 --> 01:45:59,916
Now, James...

1589
01:46:01,626 --> 01:46:05,464
We got old Sarah over
here, resting her soul.

1590
01:46:05,630 --> 01:46:08,967
If you don't tell us
where this Jesse boy is,

1591
01:46:09,134 --> 01:46:11,887
we're gonna have to put
you in there with her.

1592
01:46:12,054 --> 01:46:13,764
It's a big box.

1593
01:46:16,141 --> 01:46:18,435
Why ain't my sister buried?

1594
01:46:18,602 --> 01:46:20,896
Because you ain't buried her yet.

1595
01:46:21,063 --> 01:46:22,397
Dig a hole, nigger.

1596
01:46:22,564 --> 01:46:25,192
I ain't got but one good arm.

1597
01:46:25,359 --> 01:46:27,402
We ain't got but one good shovel.

1598
01:46:29,112 --> 01:46:32,616
Come on. Get up here, you old
crow, and dig your own hole.

1599
01:46:32,783 --> 01:46:33,783
Come on.

1600
01:46:33,784 --> 01:46:35,577
Show us what you're made of.

1601
01:46:35,744 --> 01:46:37,162
Come on. Let's go.

1602
01:46:37,329 --> 01:46:40,499
Grab that shovel. Let
me see what you can do.

1603
01:46:40,665 --> 01:46:42,000
Get him going.

1604
01:46:42,167 --> 01:46:44,586
Whoa. He's eager, ain't he?

1605
01:46:58,558 --> 01:47:00,644
James, stop it.

1606
01:47:00,811 --> 01:47:05,190
Just trying to help him put
that shovel in the ground.

1607
01:47:05,357 --> 01:47:06,650
James, listen here.

1608
01:47:06,858 --> 01:47:11,154
I want you to tell these
boys where Jesse Hunter is.

1609
01:47:11,321 --> 01:47:13,490
He was in that house
with you, wasn't he?

1610
01:47:13,657 --> 01:47:16,326
Now, tell me, hear me? Listen up.

1611
01:47:16,493 --> 01:47:19,496
James, you tell them something?

1612
01:47:19,705 --> 01:47:21,540
James, look at me.

1613
01:47:21,707 --> 01:47:24,501
You tell them something,
for God's sake.

1614
01:47:24,710 --> 01:47:26,002
I'm pleading to you.

1615
01:47:26,169 --> 01:47:30,007
Sheriff, I can't lie to you.

1616
01:47:30,173 --> 01:47:32,551
I ain't never met the man.

1617
01:47:36,471 --> 01:47:37,639
Fair enough.

1618
01:47:37,806 --> 01:47:39,975
Stop. Duke.

1619
01:47:40,142 --> 01:47:42,978
God. What's the matter
with you, Duke?

1620
01:47:43,145 --> 01:47:44,980
What the hell is the
matter with you?

1621
01:47:45,147 --> 01:47:46,148
Oh, hush up, John.

1622
01:47:46,314 --> 01:47:48,483
You done went and turned
nigger lover on us.

1623
01:47:48,650 --> 01:47:51,486
Ever since your wife passed
away, you ain't been the same.

1624
01:47:51,653 --> 01:47:52,988
I'm going home, you all.

1625
01:47:53,155 --> 01:47:54,865
Nigger lover, my ass.

1626
01:47:56,158 --> 01:47:58,535
You stupid piece of white trash.

1627
01:47:58,702 --> 01:48:00,620
What did you call me?

1628
01:48:00,787 --> 01:48:03,123
Don't you nigger lover
me, you white trash.

1629
01:48:03,290 --> 01:48:04,290
Come on.

1630
01:48:14,634 --> 01:48:17,471
Think of who you are.
Think of who you are.

1631
01:48:17,637 --> 01:48:19,014
Think of what you're saying.

1632
01:48:19,181 --> 01:48:22,017
Don't do this.

1633
01:48:22,184 --> 01:48:23,184
Nigger lover.

1634
01:48:23,185 --> 01:48:24,895
Nigger lover.

1635
01:48:25,062 --> 01:48:27,689
Whose side you on, Johnny Wright?

1636
01:48:27,898 --> 01:48:29,983
Don't even care a
white man got shot.

1637
01:48:30,150 --> 01:48:31,610
You forgetting who
you are, Johnny?

1638
01:48:36,656 --> 01:48:37,991
Go home, Johnny.

1639
01:48:38,158 --> 01:48:40,619
You go home right now.

1640
01:48:44,164 --> 01:48:46,249
You got the money
that man owes me?

1641
01:48:47,709 --> 01:48:50,337
You all gonna pay me for
all the money I'm losing?

1642
01:48:50,504 --> 01:48:51,504
Hell, no.

1643
01:48:51,505 --> 01:48:54,173
Killing all of my
customers, running 'em off.

1644
01:48:54,257 --> 01:48:56,134
You watch who you call
white trash, boy.

1645
01:48:56,301 --> 01:48:58,136
That's right.

1646
01:48:58,303 --> 01:49:00,806
Just because you rich
off nigger money,

1647
01:49:00,972 --> 01:49:03,975
you think you better
than all the rest of us?

1648
01:49:04,142 --> 01:49:05,435
That's right.

1649
01:49:05,602 --> 01:49:08,480
You get all the money in
Florida, Johnny Wright,

1650
01:49:08,647 --> 01:49:10,315
you still ain't nothing...

1651
01:49:10,482 --> 01:49:13,068
but a dirt-floor cracker.

1652
01:49:13,235 --> 01:49:16,071
Shopkeeper.

1653
01:50:00,991 --> 01:50:02,784
Hey, now, wake up.

1654
01:50:02,951 --> 01:50:04,202
Come on.

1655
01:50:04,369 --> 01:50:07,497
Come on. We got to
go. Time to wake up.

1656
01:50:07,706 --> 01:50:09,624
We're going to go this way.

1657
01:50:11,668 --> 01:50:15,005
Gertie, where are we going?

1658
01:50:15,172 --> 01:50:16,340
Keep quiet.

1659
01:50:17,632 --> 01:50:19,343
We're going to go this way.

1660
01:50:48,663 --> 01:50:51,375
I ain't got no bullets.

1661
01:51:17,275 --> 01:51:18,275
Share.

1662
01:51:18,276 --> 01:51:19,611
Hey, you all be quiet.

1663
01:51:19,778 --> 01:51:21,113
You all be quiet.

1664
01:51:21,279 --> 01:51:23,281
Want them crackers to hear you?

1665
01:51:23,448 --> 01:51:27,244
Bring the train to the old
road near Kelly's pond.

1666
01:51:27,411 --> 01:51:31,748
Get there, listen for
the engine whistle.

1667
01:51:31,915 --> 01:51:34,376
That's on the other side
of Sumner, Mr Wright.

1668
01:51:34,543 --> 01:51:36,378
How we gonna do that?

1669
01:51:36,545 --> 01:51:38,380
You're asking us to
take these children...

1670
01:51:38,547 --> 01:51:40,173
through all them crackers?

1671
01:51:40,340 --> 01:51:43,093
Can't stop near Rosewood.
It's Kelly's pond or nowhere.

1672
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:46,096
No men on the train.
That's the plan.

1673
01:51:46,263 --> 01:51:49,599
How we know we can
trust you, Mr Wright?

1674
01:51:49,808 --> 01:51:51,685
Got no choice.

1675
01:51:51,852 --> 01:51:53,603
In the trenches now.

1676
01:51:53,770 --> 01:51:58,066
8:00. That's three hours.

1677
01:51:59,651 --> 01:52:01,486
Get these folks there.

1678
01:52:01,653 --> 01:52:04,281
I'll bring the train.

1679
01:52:07,659 --> 01:52:10,495
If you're lying,
I'm coming for ya.

1680
01:52:10,662 --> 01:52:12,998
Soldier, if I'm
lying, you're dead.

1681
01:52:13,165 --> 01:52:14,207
Yes, sir.

1682
01:52:15,667 --> 01:52:17,502
We agreed about the men?

1683
01:52:17,669 --> 01:52:19,671
Yes, sir.

1684
01:52:19,838 --> 01:52:21,214
That includes you.

1685
01:52:25,677 --> 01:52:28,305
Johnny, we just went through
there this morning.

1686
01:52:28,472 --> 01:52:30,057
It ain't nothing but
ashes and smoke.

1687
01:52:30,223 --> 01:52:31,391
Town's in purgatory.

1688
01:52:31,558 --> 01:52:34,019
Billy, it's a real simple
thing, we do it right.

1689
01:52:34,186 --> 01:52:35,687
They got boys on all the bridges,

1690
01:52:35,854 --> 01:52:37,288
all the main roads looking
for coloured men.

1691
01:52:37,356 --> 01:52:38,982
We go in at night,
round back to Sumner,

1692
01:52:39,191 --> 01:52:41,568
pick up the women and children,
sweep them off to Gainesville.

1693
01:52:41,735 --> 01:52:42,861
He's talking about Sumner.

1694
01:52:43,028 --> 01:52:45,864
That's where the whole
damn thing started.

1695
01:52:46,031 --> 01:52:48,825
You're asking us to risk
our engine, Johnny.

1696
01:52:48,992 --> 01:52:50,327
Who are you Bryce brothers,

1697
01:52:50,494 --> 01:52:51,953
a couple of rich boys
playing on your train?

1698
01:52:52,120 --> 01:52:53,121
To hell with you.

1699
01:52:53,288 --> 01:52:54,655
You boys puffing around
the countryside...

1700
01:52:54,656 --> 01:52:55,723
waving and tooting your whistle?

1701
01:52:55,865 --> 01:52:56,865
To hell with you.

1702
01:52:56,875 --> 01:52:58,502
These are real folks dying,

1703
01:52:58,710 --> 01:53:00,510
women and children ain't done
nothing wrong to no soul.

1704
01:53:00,545 --> 01:53:01,545
That ain't fair, Johnny.

1705
01:53:01,672 --> 01:53:03,507
Don't talk to me
about fair, Billy.

1706
01:53:03,674 --> 01:53:08,387
They shot Sarah Carrier down
like a dog on her own porch.

1707
01:53:08,553 --> 01:53:12,015
I ain't asking you
to risk your train.

1708
01:53:12,182 --> 01:53:14,810
I'm asking you to risk your asses.

1709
01:53:35,664 --> 01:53:38,166
Think they gonna let the
women and children through?

1710
01:53:40,168 --> 01:53:41,962
I don't know.

1711
01:53:47,259 --> 01:53:49,553
Wait, wait.

1712
01:53:57,019 --> 01:53:58,437
Stay here.

1713
01:54:10,449 --> 01:54:11,533
Damn.

1714
01:54:11,742 --> 01:54:13,410
Let's go. We gotta move.

1715
01:54:30,969 --> 01:54:32,304
How far out are we?

1716
01:54:32,471 --> 01:54:34,264
About 40 minutes.

1717
01:54:34,431 --> 01:54:36,975
Can't we move this
thing any faster?

1718
01:54:37,142 --> 01:54:38,518
Push that throttle, J.B.

1719
01:54:38,685 --> 01:54:40,645
Don't you be telling us how
to run our train, Johnny.

1720
01:54:40,812 --> 01:54:43,106
We gotta take it easy on her.
She ain't been acting right.

1721
01:54:43,273 --> 01:54:44,441
Oh, she ain't?

1722
01:54:44,649 --> 01:54:47,486
You boys been treating this
train like a little sister...

1723
01:54:47,652 --> 01:54:49,112
since I known you. Get her moving.

1724
01:54:49,321 --> 01:54:50,447
She can't handle it.

1725
01:54:50,655 --> 01:54:52,949
Get this son of a bitch moving.

1726
01:54:53,116 --> 01:54:55,660
J.B., give her a little.

1727
01:55:03,669 --> 01:55:04,669
Feel better?

1728
01:55:04,795 --> 01:55:06,254
Yeah.

1729
01:55:07,422 --> 01:55:09,341
I feel better.

1730
01:55:13,679 --> 01:55:14,680
I'm tired.

1731
01:55:14,846 --> 01:55:16,848
I don't feel like going.

1732
01:55:17,015 --> 01:55:18,308
Hush up.

1733
01:55:18,475 --> 01:55:19,851
Hush up, be quiet.

1734
01:55:34,157 --> 01:55:36,159
That truck coming, boys.

1735
01:55:37,661 --> 01:55:38,995
Watch out, now.

1736
01:55:39,162 --> 01:55:40,622
Watch yourself.

1737
01:55:47,087 --> 01:55:48,505
Get on up.

1738
01:56:15,949 --> 01:56:16,949
Come on.

1739
01:56:19,077 --> 01:56:21,329
Wait, wait.

1740
01:56:34,760 --> 01:56:36,845
Might as well come look.

1741
01:56:38,889 --> 01:56:41,266
Make room for my boy here.

1742
01:57:18,470 --> 01:57:20,514
Why you crying, boy?

1743
01:57:20,681 --> 01:57:22,265
There's babies in there.

1744
01:57:24,059 --> 01:57:27,813
A nigger is a nigger,
boy. None of us like it.

1745
01:57:27,979 --> 01:57:30,774
God made the world the way it is,

1746
01:57:30,941 --> 01:57:32,526
and we just got to live in it.

1747
01:57:32,693 --> 01:57:38,448
You get as old as I am,
you become a man...

1748
01:57:38,615 --> 01:57:41,451
you're gonna learn
a lot of things.

1749
01:57:45,706 --> 01:57:48,250
A nigger is a nigger, boy.

1750
01:57:48,417 --> 01:57:50,502
That's the way.

1751
01:57:51,878 --> 01:57:54,589
You understand me, Emmett?

1752
01:57:54,756 --> 01:57:55,882
You understand me?

1753
01:58:01,722 --> 01:58:03,056
She's overheating.

1754
01:58:05,851 --> 01:58:06,851
Damn it.

1755
01:58:06,935 --> 01:58:07,978
Damn it, I told you.

1756
01:58:08,186 --> 01:58:10,188
We're stopping, we're stopping.

1757
01:58:10,355 --> 01:58:11,898
We can't stop. No, no.

1758
01:58:12,065 --> 01:58:13,608
Don't you get it?

1759
01:58:13,775 --> 01:58:15,444
Don't you get it?

1760
01:58:15,610 --> 01:58:16,903
We are stopped.

1761
01:58:17,070 --> 01:58:19,114
We can't go anywhere.

1762
01:58:19,281 --> 01:58:21,408
It's your fault.

1763
01:58:21,575 --> 01:58:22,993
Your fault.

1764
01:58:24,369 --> 01:58:26,788
Goddamn counterbalance pin.

1765
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:29,166
Damn it.

1766
01:58:29,333 --> 01:58:32,669
J.B., leave him alone. You
gotta check the engine.

1767
01:58:41,887 --> 01:58:45,390
Don't you heathens touch my porch.

1768
01:58:45,557 --> 01:58:46,557
Step aside.

1769
01:58:46,558 --> 01:58:48,101
We hear you're hiding
niggers in here.

1770
01:58:48,268 --> 01:58:51,438
Turn around, Earl, before I
send us both to damnation.

1771
01:58:54,024 --> 01:58:55,650
Jesus Christ, Mary.

1772
01:58:55,817 --> 01:58:57,986
That damn thing ain't
loaded anyway.

1773
01:58:58,153 --> 01:58:59,863
Oh, yes, it is.

1774
01:59:00,030 --> 01:59:01,782
You got any niggers
in there, Mary?

1775
01:59:01,948 --> 01:59:04,785
Willing to kill a white
woman to find out, Bobby?

1776
01:59:04,951 --> 01:59:06,370
Now turn around and get home.

1777
01:59:06,578 --> 01:59:08,038
Get on, get.

1778
01:59:09,456 --> 01:59:12,417
Come on, Earl. Ain't no
niggers around here.

1779
01:59:12,584 --> 01:59:13,877
Come on, you all.

1780
01:59:14,044 --> 01:59:15,045
Come on, now.

1781
01:59:15,212 --> 01:59:19,633
You men best hope the Lord feels
merciful come Judgement Day.

1782
01:59:21,176 --> 01:59:22,803
Hush.

1783
01:59:36,108 --> 01:59:38,318
Everybody front and centre.

1784
01:59:41,029 --> 01:59:42,280
Lieutenant.

1785
01:59:46,702 --> 01:59:47,869
Where's Arnett?

1786
01:59:48,078 --> 01:59:49,496
He gone.

1787
01:59:50,956 --> 01:59:52,082
Where's Minnie?

1788
01:59:55,377 --> 01:59:56,920
Stay put.

1789
02:00:09,766 --> 02:00:13,061
What you all boys need to get
this engine running again?

1790
02:00:13,228 --> 02:00:14,563
Something we ain't got.

1791
02:00:14,730 --> 02:00:17,149
Counterbalance pin.

1792
02:00:17,315 --> 02:00:19,985
What is a counterbalance pin?

1793
02:00:20,152 --> 02:00:21,528
Oh, it ain't nothing.

1794
02:00:21,695 --> 02:00:24,239
Piece of metal about this long.

1795
02:00:39,171 --> 02:00:41,548
Be quiet. Minnie, be quiet.

1796
02:01:01,985 --> 02:01:05,739
All right, you all men, listen
up. Let's call it a night.

1797
02:01:05,906 --> 02:01:07,908
Bobby, Earl, give me a hand.
Get these men out of here.

1798
02:01:08,075 --> 02:01:09,159
You all go home.

1799
02:01:09,368 --> 02:01:12,162
Get these men out of here. Go on.

1800
02:01:12,329 --> 02:01:14,956
No more camping out in
my town. You hear me?

1801
02:01:15,123 --> 02:01:16,833
Hush, you all, hush.

1802
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,335
All right, I see you in there.

1803
02:01:18,502 --> 02:01:20,087
What you up to, Duke?
What do you see?

1804
02:01:20,253 --> 02:01:21,987
Hold still, now. Right up
against that tree, you all.

1805
02:01:22,130 --> 02:01:23,256
Go get him.

1806
02:01:28,220 --> 02:01:30,055
Minnie. Minnie's back.

1807
02:01:32,599 --> 02:01:34,017
Where you been?

1808
02:01:34,184 --> 02:01:35,268
What...

1809
02:01:36,853 --> 02:01:39,773
He gonna get killed
looking for you.

1810
02:01:49,032 --> 02:01:52,035
Show you to rape my wife.

1811
02:01:56,206 --> 02:01:57,708
Put him up.

1812
02:02:02,212 --> 02:02:04,589
Simmer down, you all.

1813
02:02:04,756 --> 02:02:06,258
I had a nice quiet town here,

1814
02:02:06,425 --> 02:02:09,469
but you put an end to
that, didn't you, boy?

1815
02:02:09,636 --> 02:02:10,971
Wasn't no coloured boy...

1816
02:02:11,138 --> 02:02:12,764
had nothing do to with
what happened there.

1817
02:02:12,931 --> 02:02:13,931
Shut up.

1818
02:02:13,974 --> 02:02:15,225
Shut up, Jesse.

1819
02:02:15,392 --> 02:02:16,935
That ain't my name.

1820
02:02:26,695 --> 02:02:28,613
Clear a path.

1821
02:02:28,780 --> 02:02:30,073
Get back, get back.

1822
02:02:30,240 --> 02:02:31,992
Run the nigger up.

1823
02:02:37,289 --> 02:02:39,207
Ha, damn you.

1824
02:02:39,374 --> 02:02:40,709
Come on, you stupid horse.

1825
02:02:40,876 --> 02:02:43,795
Just shoot the damn horse.

1826
02:02:43,962 --> 02:02:46,089
Booker T., go.

1827
02:02:55,223 --> 02:02:58,226
Goddamn.

1828
02:03:21,249 --> 02:03:23,585
That is one strong buck.

1829
02:03:23,752 --> 02:03:25,379
Why won't he die?

1830
02:03:25,545 --> 02:03:27,714
He gonna die, he gonna die.
His neck ain't that thick.

1831
02:03:27,881 --> 02:03:29,675
Oh, he'll die,

1832
02:03:29,841 --> 02:03:33,345
only he probably didn't
have nothing to do with it.

1833
02:03:33,512 --> 02:03:37,724
Well, truth be told,
none of 'em did.

1834
02:03:37,891 --> 02:03:40,310
What the hell does
that mean, Ellis?

1835
02:03:40,519 --> 02:03:44,439
It means, James, that you
know as well as I do...

1836
02:03:44,648 --> 02:03:46,817
what Fanny'd been
doing lunch times.

1837
02:03:46,983 --> 02:03:49,820
Some of you all know
better than others.

1838
02:03:49,986 --> 02:03:51,196
That's right.

1839
02:03:51,363 --> 02:03:52,698
Should have never listened to her.

1840
02:03:52,864 --> 02:03:54,408
That woman's a wildcat.

1841
02:04:52,174 --> 02:04:53,884
Booker T.

1842
02:05:00,307 --> 02:05:01,808
Shoot him.

1843
02:05:05,270 --> 02:05:08,023
Sorry I had to say
it that way, James,

1844
02:05:08,190 --> 02:05:11,860
but this thing's gone far enough.

1845
02:05:15,614 --> 02:05:18,075
Fanny lied...

1846
02:05:18,241 --> 02:05:21,578
to you, to me, the
whole damn town.

1847
02:05:25,123 --> 02:05:29,711
Deep down, I don't think I
believed her from the start.

1848
02:05:29,878 --> 02:05:31,380
If that's how you feel,

1849
02:05:31,588 --> 02:05:33,674
why'd you take her
word for this, Ellis?

1850
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:36,134
What choice I got, huh?

1851
02:05:36,301 --> 02:05:38,428
I am the sheriff.

1852
02:05:38,595 --> 02:05:39,846
Damn.

1853
02:05:40,013 --> 02:05:41,973
My badge.

1854
02:05:47,979 --> 02:05:50,774
What's gonna keep it in place?

1855
02:05:52,067 --> 02:05:53,694
Prayer.

1856
02:06:04,079 --> 02:06:05,580
Move it.

1857
02:06:19,553 --> 02:06:21,555
Come on, move.

1858
02:06:33,608 --> 02:06:36,528
Get on board, get on
board, get on board.

1859
02:06:37,779 --> 02:06:41,033
Get 'em on, get 'em on.

1860
02:06:41,199 --> 02:06:43,702
Come on, move.

1861
02:06:45,537 --> 02:06:46,537
Get on, get on.

1862
02:06:46,663 --> 02:06:48,999
Come on. We ain't gonna sit
on the track all night.

1863
02:06:49,166 --> 02:06:50,167
Move.

1864
02:06:53,503 --> 02:06:54,503
Get them on.

1865
02:06:54,588 --> 02:06:55,964
Quickly.

1866
02:06:58,467 --> 02:06:59,760
Let's go.

1867
02:06:59,926 --> 02:07:01,428
Let's go. Let's get
the hell out of here.

1868
02:07:59,111 --> 02:08:01,738
You can't come on.
You can't come on.

1869
02:08:01,905 --> 02:08:03,031
Let me on this train.

1870
02:08:03,198 --> 02:08:04,408
I said get down.

1871
02:08:04,574 --> 02:08:08,412
If they find men on this
train, they'll kill everyone.

1872
02:08:08,578 --> 02:08:09,621
Get off.

1873
02:08:14,626 --> 02:08:16,878
Please.

1874
02:08:17,045 --> 02:08:19,006
Stop the train.

1875
02:08:30,267 --> 02:08:32,894
Get back. If they find
men on this train,

1876
02:08:33,061 --> 02:08:34,730
they'll kill all the
women and children.

1877
02:08:34,938 --> 02:08:36,314
You can't come on here.

1878
02:08:45,282 --> 02:08:46,867
No.

1879
02:08:48,118 --> 02:08:49,286
Get down, get down.

1880
02:08:56,543 --> 02:08:57,961
What the hell you doing?

1881
02:08:58,170 --> 02:09:01,131
This is a war. We're
in the trenches.

1882
02:09:26,698 --> 02:09:27,866
Jesus Christ.

1883
02:09:28,033 --> 02:09:29,326
Come on, girl.

1884
02:09:32,245 --> 02:09:34,331
Child, stay down. Stay down.

1885
02:10:14,830 --> 02:10:16,581
You all can get up now.

1886
02:10:56,413 --> 02:10:58,790
You can't go, Mann.
You just can't.

1887
02:10:58,957 --> 02:11:00,334
Don't leave us, Mann.

1888
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:02,919
Please don't leave us.

1889
02:11:03,086 --> 02:11:04,713
Hush now.

1890
02:11:04,921 --> 02:11:08,050
You all gonna be safe.

1891
02:11:08,216 --> 02:11:10,677
Scrappie in charge
from here on in.

1892
02:11:10,844 --> 02:11:13,513
Arnett, you're a lieutenant.
You help her out.

1893
02:11:13,680 --> 02:11:15,640
Take these children inside.

1894
02:11:17,642 --> 02:11:19,936
You all gonna be all right.

1895
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,460
That's Booker T.

1896
02:11:43,627 --> 02:11:46,755
Mr Mann, who is that
riding your horse?

1897
02:11:50,050 --> 02:11:52,928
It's Sylvester.

1898
02:12:05,857 --> 02:12:07,442
Uncle Sylvester made it.
All right. He made it.

1899
02:12:07,651 --> 02:12:09,236
Sylvester, how you doing?

1900
02:12:09,403 --> 02:12:12,155
Uncle Sylvester's alive.

1901
02:12:21,123 --> 02:12:23,542
I ain't got all night, Mann.

1902
02:12:23,709 --> 02:12:26,253
Gertie, you all get to
Cousin Wilma in Gainesville.

1903
02:12:26,420 --> 02:12:27,587
Come on.

1904
02:12:28,797 --> 02:12:31,508
I'll be waiting for
you in Gainesville.

1905
02:12:31,675 --> 02:12:33,802
Won't be waiting long.

1906
02:13:05,625 --> 02:13:07,461
How'd you get out?

1907
02:13:08,712 --> 02:13:10,630
They carried me...

1908
02:13:11,465 --> 02:13:13,216
in my mama's coffin.

1909
02:13:44,289 --> 02:13:46,291
They were here.

1910
02:13:46,458 --> 02:13:47,918
A mob.

1911
02:13:48,085 --> 02:13:49,920
They tried to get in.

1912
02:13:52,464 --> 02:13:53,590
What happened?

1913
02:13:53,757 --> 02:13:55,801
Mum scared 'em off.

1914
02:14:05,102 --> 02:14:06,561
Boys.

1915
02:14:07,604 --> 02:14:08,730
Boys.

1916
02:14:54,359 --> 02:14:56,945
Come here. Get up. Get up.

1917
02:15:02,159 --> 02:15:04,786
Liar.

1918
02:15:04,953 --> 02:15:06,621
Damn you, woman.

1919
02:15:14,588 --> 02:15:17,132
Where you going, boy?

1920
02:15:17,299 --> 02:15:18,800
You little crab.

1921
02:15:19,009 --> 02:15:20,927
You eat my food, then
you walk away sideways.

1922
02:15:21,094 --> 02:15:23,138
Emmett.

1923
02:15:27,184 --> 02:15:30,312
Emmett, come on back
in the house, boy.

1924
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:31,897
I'm sick.

1925
02:15:32,064 --> 02:15:33,732
My hands is hurting me bad.

1926
02:15:33,899 --> 02:15:36,735
I need your help, and my back...

1927
02:15:37,819 --> 02:15:40,530
Emmett, I don't mean to
be hard on you, boy.

1928
02:15:40,739 --> 02:15:42,574
I just want what's best for you.

1929
02:15:42,741 --> 02:15:44,993
I want to learn you how
to live in the world.

1930
02:15:47,579 --> 02:15:49,039
I hate you.

1931
02:15:50,082 --> 02:15:51,541
You ain't no man.

1932
02:15:56,129 --> 02:15:57,673
I don't know what you are, Daddy.

1933
02:16:00,342 --> 02:16:02,844
Emmett, you come back... Emmett.

1934
02:16:03,011 --> 02:16:05,347
Don't you walk away.
Come on here, boy.

1935
02:16:05,514 --> 02:16:07,516
Emmett, come on back in here.

1936
02:16:51,059 --> 02:16:53,061
Which way are you headed?

1937
02:16:56,064 --> 02:16:59,568
Same as you, friend. Going
to catch that train.

1937
02:17:00,305 --> 02:18:00,659
