00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,284
Ready? Okay.

3
00:00:29,285 --> 00:00:31,520
Wishing and hoping

4
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:34,122
And thinking and praying

5
00:00:34,123 --> 00:00:36,091
Planning and dreaming

6
00:00:36,092 --> 00:00:39,694
Each night of his charms

7
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:44,699
That won't get you into his arms

8
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,736
So if you're looking to find love

9
00:00:47,737 --> 00:00:52,874
That you can share

10
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:54,476
All you've got to do

11
00:00:54,477 --> 00:00:56,711
Is hold him and kiss him

12
00:00:56,712 --> 00:01:01,149
And love him and show him that you care

13
00:01:02,218 --> 00:01:07,289
Show him that you care just for him

14
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,393
Do the things that he likes to do

15
00:01:11,394 --> 00:01:16,331
Wear your hair just for him

16
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,368
'Cause you won't get him

17
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:23,838
Thinking and praying
Wishing and hoping

18
00:01:23,839 --> 00:01:26,575
Just wishing and hoping

19
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:29,077
And thinking and praying

20
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:34,583
Planning and dreaming his kisses will start

21
00:01:34,584 --> 00:01:38,520
That won't get you into his heart

22
00:01:39,722 --> 00:01:42,924
So if you're thinking of how great

23
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:47,055
True love is

24
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:53,935
And squeeze him and love him

25
00:01:53,936 --> 00:01:57,606
Just do it and after you do

26
00:01:57,607 --> 00:02:00,542
You will be his

27
00:03:24,026 --> 00:03:28,196
Two and two, menu!
Brian, 22, immediately!

28
00:03:28,197 --> 00:03:29,864
Guillermo!

29
00:03:29,865 --> 00:03:32,200
Two pigeons! Right away!

30
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:34,567
"V.I.P."
Very important table right here!

31
00:03:41,911 --> 00:03:42,900
Give me two grain!

32
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:47,315
- I'll take that polenta!
- All right, Chef.

33
00:03:47,316 --> 00:03:49,317
- This is the one I'm waiting for!
- Yes, sir.

34
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:53,154
I need that special meat now.
Pastry, get ready. It's coming at you.

35
00:03:53,155 --> 00:03:55,890
I will kill your family it you don't
get this right. I need this perfect.

36
00:03:55,891 --> 00:03:56,915
Yes, sir.

37
00:04:15,411 --> 00:04:17,912
I'm writing it up as...

38
00:04:17,913 --> 00:04:20,248
inventive and...

39
00:04:20,249 --> 00:04:21,682
confident.

40
00:04:26,856 --> 00:04:31,350
- Did the chap from <i>Newsday</i> ever call?
- I'll check my machine.

41
00:04:32,595 --> 00:04:35,430
Is this a real interview or some cute guy...

42
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:37,432
- you're setting me up with?
- Please, Julianne.

43
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:40,268
I don't send you men anymore.
You have no idea what to do with them.

44
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:44,606
It's Michael.
Jules, it must be months, huh?

45
00:04:44,607 --> 00:04:50,445
I can't wait to talk to you.
I'm in Chicago at the Drake Hotel.

46
00:04:50,446 --> 00:04:54,449
Call me. 4:00 in the morning,
whatever. We gotta talk. Bye.

47
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,620
- Who called? Man of the moment?
- No, the opposite.

48
00:04:58,621 --> 00:05:02,557
It's my Michael. Michael O'Neal.
Sounds desperate to talk to me

49
00:05:02,558 --> 00:05:06,094
The wandering sportswriter.
Remind me about that one.

50
00:05:06,095 --> 00:05:07,595
Sophomore year at Brown...

51
00:05:07,596 --> 00:05:11,299
we had this one hot month.

52
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,303
But you know me.
I got restless.

53
00:05:15,304 --> 00:05:18,973
So I get up the nerve to break his heart...

54
00:05:18,974 --> 00:05:20,965
and he gives me this look.

55
00:05:22,344 --> 00:05:24,646
Then he said, "The thing that makes me want to cry is...

56
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:27,982
I'm losing the best friend
I ever had."

57
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:31,820
At that moment, I knew I tell the same way.

58
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:35,824
So I cried for maybe the third time in my entire life...

59
00:05:35,825 --> 00:05:37,492
kissed him...

60
00:05:37,493 --> 00:05:40,257
and we've been best friends ever since.

61
00:05:41,497 --> 00:05:43,761
We've seen each other through everything:

62
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:47,669
losing jobs...

63
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,171
losing parents, losing lovers.

64
00:05:50,172 --> 00:05:53,107
We've traveled all over.

65
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:55,844
The best times of my life, maybe.

66
00:05:55,845 --> 00:06:00,014
Drinking and talking, even if it's just over the phone.

67
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:03,451
Go on. This is so moving.

68
00:06:03,452 --> 00:06:07,115
He's nothing like me.
He's like you actually, only straight.

69
00:06:08,424 --> 00:06:11,993
I remember this one night in Tucson six years ago.

70
00:06:11,994 --> 00:06:15,029
He takes a razor out of this little shaving kit...

71
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:18,032
cuts his finger, takes my hand, does the same to me.

72
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:21,369
- I'm gonna be sick.
- He says, "Swear when we're 28...

73
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,339
if we've never married,
we marry each other."

74
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,075
We never talked about it again.

75
00:06:27,076 --> 00:06:30,879
I don't know what made me think of that.

76
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,077
You're about to be 28 in three weeks, right?

77
00:06:35,217 --> 00:06:39,420
- How old is he?
- You think?

78
00:06:39,421 --> 00:06:42,219
Desperate to talk.

79
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:52,166
Cheers.

82
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:16,925
- Good evening. The Drake Hotel.
- I'm calling for Michael O'Neal...

83
00:07:16,926 --> 00:07:20,020
- but since it's so late--
- One moment, please.

84
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:23,864
Hello?

85
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:29,270
You've been enrolled
in the Obscene caller of the Month Club.

86
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:32,273
Hey, beautiful.
It's so great to hear your voice.

87
00:07:32,274 --> 00:07:35,610
I miss you. I've been
calling you for over a month.

88
00:07:35,611 --> 00:07:37,445
I've been on a book tour.

89
00:07:37,446 --> 00:07:40,615
- I figured you were out of town.
- My machine eats all my messages.

90
00:07:40,616 --> 00:07:42,951
Or you're just averaging 30 days to return a call.

91
00:07:42,952 --> 00:07:47,789
- It's less when it's you.
- I have to ask you something important.

92
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,791
If you turn me down, I don't know what I'll do.

93
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:53,888
It I could just tell you one thing first.

94
00:07:55,798 --> 00:07:58,967
This is probably going to hand you...

95
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:01,970
the biggest laugh of your adult life...

96
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:04,806
but I was thinking about you, and I was remembering...

97
00:08:04,807 --> 00:08:10,351
this unbelievably insane night we spent in Tucson...

98
00:08:10,352 --> 00:08:12,647
like a thousand years ago.

99
00:08:12,648 --> 00:08:14,983
- You probably won't remember this--
- Are you kidding?

100
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:17,986
I think about that night all the time.

101
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:19,988
You do?

102
00:08:19,989 --> 00:08:23,324
But it's not why I called.

103
00:08:23,325 --> 00:08:24,826
It's not.

104
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:27,921
I called because I met someone.

105
00:08:30,332 --> 00:08:32,000
That's great.

106
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:37,171
You haven't really seen anybody
since that dingbat Jenny Lee, have you?

107
00:08:37,172 --> 00:08:38,840
You don't understand.

108
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:41,843
I've never felt this way about anybody.

109
00:08:41,844 --> 00:08:45,680
- She's all wrong for me.
- That's a good start.

110
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:47,849
She's a junior at the University of Chicago.

111
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,019
She's 20. Her name's Kim.
You're gonna love her. She's beautiful.

112
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,856
Her dad is this billionaire. He owns
the White Sox and some cable empire.

113
00:08:54,857 --> 00:08:57,525
I've always been uncomfortable around rich people.

114
00:08:57,526 --> 00:09:01,195
- Sure.
- But they're not like that.

115
00:09:01,196 --> 00:09:05,700
They're such wonderful people.
Salt of the earth.

116
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:07,965
So you've met her parents?

117
00:09:09,872 --> 00:09:13,205
Jules, we're getting married this Sunday.

118
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,644
- Hello?
- Michael--

119
00:09:19,715 --> 00:09:21,883
It's Wednesday night.

120
00:09:21,884 --> 00:09:24,052
How can you possibly be getting married on Sunday?

121
00:09:24,053 --> 00:09:25,720
Actually, it starts tomorrow.

122
00:09:25,721 --> 00:09:28,723
It's a four-day wedding
with all the traditional events...

123
00:09:28,724 --> 00:09:33,227
and 10 million people flying in from all over the world.

124
00:09:33,228 --> 00:09:37,398
Aren't you working this weekend?
Is that responsible?

125
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:42,904
The Sox are at home and Sports is
letting me do a profile on Frank Thomas.

126
00:09:42,905 --> 00:09:45,073
Wait.
What do you mean, irresponsible?

127
00:09:45,074 --> 00:09:47,668
Taking off a weekend to get married?

128
00:09:49,578 --> 00:09:51,671
Jules, I'm scared.

129
00:09:53,415 --> 00:09:57,418
- Maybe we should talk about this.
- I need you.

130
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:00,755
If you can't come and hold my hand,
I'll never get through this.

131
00:10:00,756 --> 00:10:02,690
Please come.

132
00:10:05,094 --> 00:10:08,296
I can't wait for you to meet her.

133
00:10:08,297 --> 00:10:12,266
"UNITED AIRLINES"
Listen, Jules.

134
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:14,268
Let's stop for a drink.
You can take a later flight.

135
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:18,106
I'm a busy girl. I've got four days
to break up a wedding...

136
00:10:18,107 --> 00:10:22,210
steal the bride's fellow,
and I haven't one clue how to do it.

137
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:24,946
He adored me for nine goddamn years.

138
00:10:24,947 --> 00:10:28,649
- I can see why.
- She has known him for five seconds.

139
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,120
Plus, she's got billions of dollars,
and she's apparently perfect.

140
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:36,558
So don't go feeling all sorry for Miss Preteen Illinois.

141
00:10:38,961 --> 00:10:42,397
I can't lose him, George.
I'm going to bring him back.

142
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:45,633
You give your hand to me

143
00:10:45,634 --> 00:10:48,469
You give your hand to me

144
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,938
And then you say hello

145
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:55,309
I can hardly speak

146
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,813
My heart is beating so

147
00:10:58,814 --> 00:11:02,483
And anyone can tell

148
00:11:02,484 --> 00:11:05,653
You think you know me well

149
00:11:05,654 --> 00:11:09,021
But you don't know me

150
00:11:11,827 --> 00:11:15,997
No, you don't know the one

151
00:11:15,998 --> 00:11:19,667
Who dreams of you at night

152
00:11:19,668 --> 00:11:23,004
Wants to kiss your lips

153
00:11:23,005 --> 00:11:26,007
Wants to hold you tight

154
00:11:26,008 --> 00:11:29,343
I am just a friend

155
00:11:29,344 --> 00:11:33,014
That's all I've ever been

156
00:11:33,015 --> 00:11:36,781
- Can you believe I'm gonna do this?
- Not hardly.

157
00:11:52,034 --> 00:11:55,136
This just makes everything so perfect.

158
00:11:55,137 --> 00:11:59,665
Since I've met Michael, all I've heard
is "Julianne this" and "Julianne that."

159
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:02,510
I've never had a sister.

00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:12,987
I have this monstrous favor to ask you.

161
00:12:12,988 --> 00:12:14,722
- Excuse me?
- My best friend...

162
00:12:14,723 --> 00:12:20,228
shattered her pelvis line dancing
in Abilene over spring break.

163
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:22,697
- Be my maid of honor?
- What?

164
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:29,036
Shouldn't you promote a bridesmaid
or someone you've known longer?

165
00:12:29,037 --> 00:12:32,573
My bridesmaids are my only two
female relatives under the age of 40...

166
00:12:32,574 --> 00:12:36,577
debutante sisters from Nashville
who are basically vengeful sluts.

167
00:12:36,578 --> 00:12:37,875
My exit!

168
00:12:40,782 --> 00:12:43,351
I have tour days to make you my new best friend.

169
00:12:43,352 --> 00:12:46,412
It's time for you to force yourself to get personal.

170
00:13:00,435 --> 00:13:03,104
- Do you like the color?
- I think it's beautiful.

171
00:13:03,105 --> 00:13:05,106
- Isn't that perfect for her?
- Absolutely.

172
00:13:05,107 --> 00:13:08,109
This is going to be tighter.
You don't want those things to fall out.

173
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,312
- It's beautiful.
- I'm not hurting you.

174
00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:16,217
I don't want her to trip, so I'll take this up a tiny bit.

175
00:13:16,218 --> 00:13:18,584
Would you rather the daffodil?

176
00:13:20,656 --> 00:13:24,458
I thought the bridesmaids all wore the same dress.

177
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:28,486
Not you. You wouldn't be comfortable
unless you were distinctive.

178
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:33,434
What else did he tell you?

179
00:13:33,435 --> 00:13:36,470
You hate weddings.
You never go.

180
00:13:36,471 --> 00:13:38,973
You're not up for anything conventional...

181
00:13:38,974 --> 00:13:42,910
or anything that's assumed to be a female priority...

182
00:13:44,146 --> 00:13:48,482
including marriage
or romance or even--

183
00:13:48,483 --> 00:13:50,075
Love?

184
00:13:51,987 --> 00:13:54,822
Michael and I were a wrong tip right from the start.

185
00:13:54,823 --> 00:13:57,491
He said that too.

186
00:13:57,492 --> 00:14:00,829
I thought I was like you, and proud to be...

187
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:05,032
until I met rumpled, smelly, old Michael.

188
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:07,501
Then I found I was just a sentimental schmuck...

189
00:14:07,502 --> 00:14:11,172
like all those flighty nitwits I'd always pitied.

190
00:14:11,173 --> 00:14:13,164
It's funny, huh?

191
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:17,103
I need a cigarette.

192
00:14:25,854 --> 00:14:27,855
George, how do you think I feel?

193
00:14:27,856 --> 00:14:30,524
All she does is talk about her and Michael's future.

194
00:14:30,525 --> 00:14:35,496
- She's just so dreamy.
- Jules, pull yourself together.

195
00:14:35,497 --> 00:14:37,727
I don't know if I can do it.

196
00:14:39,634 --> 00:14:42,203
You want me to turn around or something?

197
00:14:42,204 --> 00:14:45,970
Not the person I was expecting.

198
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,638
I've seen you a lot more naked than that.

199
00:14:53,882 --> 00:14:58,319
Things are different now.

200
00:15:02,057 --> 00:15:03,991
I guess so.

201
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,066
You look really good...

202
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:14,365
without your clothes on.

203
00:15:25,247 --> 00:15:26,680
She's toast.

204
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,843
"CAUTION 2-WAY TRAFFIC"
"EXIT"

205
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,259
- Where is the honeymoon exactly?
- It depends.

206
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,762
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there.
"CHICAGO HILTON AND TOWERS"

207
00:15:41,763 --> 00:15:44,265
Or Phoenix. Or depending
on the Indiana-Cleveland game--

208
00:15:44,266 --> 00:15:45,933
Garden spots, all.

209
00:15:45,934 --> 00:15:49,103
A swing of maybe 40 degrees Fahrenheit
represents a packing challenge...

210
00:15:49,104 --> 00:15:52,940
but there's tine food and cocktails
at a choice of Embassy Suites.

211
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:57,077
It's his career. I'm supportive.
I've been everywhere.

212
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:01,215
I want to be with the man I love.
That's what makes it a honeymoon.

213
00:16:01,216 --> 00:16:07,188
He's lucky. One woman in a billion
could put up with his shit.

214
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:10,424
The guy's a one-man festival
of idiosyncratic--

215
00:16:10,425 --> 00:16:13,093
You've been introduced
to the symphonic range--

216
00:16:13,094 --> 00:16:16,297
Of his snoring?
He says it's worse than ever.

217
00:16:16,298 --> 00:16:18,596
You know that snarfle one?

218
00:16:21,303 --> 00:16:25,399
Now it's got this phlegm-rattling thing
happening behind it.

219
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:34,482
Earplugs work.

220
00:16:34,483 --> 00:16:37,685
- What about--
- Cigars in bed? I broke him of that.

221
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:40,621
The bathroom's a swamp.
He wears <i>Reeboks</i> to dinner.

222
00:16:40,622 --> 00:16:44,425
He likes action movies.
He reads over my Shoulder.

223
00:16:44,426 --> 00:16:46,360
He loves karaoke bars...

224
00:16:46,361 --> 00:16:48,662
- and I can't carry a tune.
- Really?

225
00:16:48,663 --> 00:16:51,165
He sucks soup through his front teeth.

226
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:54,499
That's a trademark move.
Don't touch that one.

227
00:16:56,338 --> 00:16:58,772
But he sure can kiss.

228
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:04,604
It's been a while.
I'm just gonna take your word on that.

229
00:17:10,185 --> 00:17:14,522
After two weeks of cataloging all his faults...

230
00:17:14,523 --> 00:17:17,458
I made a command decision that changed my life.

231
00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:24,064
I threw the list away.

232
00:17:24,065 --> 00:17:26,400
He's not a balance sheet.
He's Michael.

233
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:28,502
Loving him means loving all of him.

234
00:17:28,503 --> 00:17:30,304
Do you get nervous in confined spaces?

235
00:17:30,305 --> 00:17:32,373
It's sweet of you to want to be protective...

236
00:17:32,374 --> 00:17:36,176
but nothing ever could give me
one moment's pause about this marriage.

237
00:17:36,177 --> 00:17:40,409
- Do you become hysterical in confined--
- Except one.

238
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,851
You. You're always
in his mind...

239
00:17:43,852 --> 00:17:46,187
this perfect creature he loved for years.

240
00:17:46,714 --> 00:17:49,223
Perfection can get wearing after awhile.

241
00:17:49,224 --> 00:17:52,059
I'm not kidding. I had to face up
to my competitive drives.

242
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,395
Believe me, I've got them.

243
00:17:54,396 --> 00:17:57,731
Am I gonna be jealous of you for the rest of my life?

244
00:17:57,732 --> 00:17:59,867
- Our paths will keep crossing.
- Space. of course.

245
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:01,402
- He'll always talk about you.
- It's only natural.

246
00:18:01,403 --> 00:18:04,572
The answer was so simple.

247
00:18:04,573 --> 00:18:07,575
I was gonna predict that.

248
00:18:07,576 --> 00:18:08,076
You win.

249
00:18:11,846 --> 00:18:13,279
I've missed a step.

250
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:17,418
He's got you on a pedestal...

251
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:19,387
and me in his arms.

252
00:18:27,262 --> 00:18:31,298
My God, it's the bride
and the woman she'll never live up to.

253
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:34,101
- Are you okay, honey?
- That would be us.

254
00:18:34,102 --> 00:18:36,770
Did she say the wrong thing again?
That is so in character.

255
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:38,939
- I'm Julianne Potter.
- We'd be the vengeful sluts.

256
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,110
- You can just call us eager.
- Have you sized up the groomsmen?

257
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:47,114
- As maid of honor, you get first pick.
- Don't pick the short, hairy, tat one.

258
00:18:47,115 --> 00:18:49,617
- He's mine.
- Kimmy's a virgin.

259
00:18:49,618 --> 00:18:52,052
Is this Michael's Julianne?

260
00:18:52,053 --> 00:18:54,622
I'm Isabelle Wallace.

261
00:18:54,623 --> 00:18:57,421
My handsome new son scarcely did you justice.

262
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,129
My husband says to scoot you to the ballpark...

263
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,231
so you can hang with Michael.

264
00:19:04,232 --> 00:19:07,301
But first you have to meet a lot of really old women.

265
00:19:07,302 --> 00:19:10,567
That is, it you've absorbed enough profanity.

266
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:26,120
Who ordered a beer?

267
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:30,958
- Let me help you with that.
- You unwittingly imply I'm clumsy.

268
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:33,661
Sorry. I was confusing you
with somebody I used to know.

269
00:19:33,662 --> 00:19:36,797
Julianne Potter, this is Hank and Eric
from <i>Sport Magazine</i>.

270
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:38,799
- Nice to meet you.
- They kindly gave me a job.

271
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,435
- Hi, there.
- How do you do?

272
00:19:41,436 --> 00:19:44,705
And this is Walter, my father-in-Law.

273
00:19:44,706 --> 00:19:47,174
Future father-in-Law.
"COMISKEY"

274
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:48,676
Thank you.

275
00:19:48,677 --> 00:19:51,305
If he gives you any grief, come see me.

276
00:19:52,881 --> 00:19:56,684
- And this guy you know.
- Papa Joe.

277
00:19:56,685 --> 00:20:02,189
I told him to make you best man,
but he had to go with his baby brother.

278
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,858
Best-looking guy in any room.

279
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:07,795
- Great to see you.
- That will do.

280
00:20:07,796 --> 00:20:11,031
- Scotty, that will do.
- Sorry.

281
00:20:11,032 --> 00:20:13,701
Remember, it is the duty of the best man...

282
00:20:13,702 --> 00:20:17,004
to dance with the maid of honor.

283
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:19,540
Dance? You can't dance.

284
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:24,477
- When did you learn to dance?
- I've got moves you've never seen.

285
00:20:24,478 --> 00:20:27,745
You're an impostor.

286
00:20:29,384 --> 00:20:31,719
What did you do with my best friend?

287
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,222
"CHICAGO TRIBUNE"
I'm still your best friend.

288
00:20:35,223 --> 00:20:37,885
You just haven't seen me for awhile.

289
00:20:42,397 --> 00:20:46,834
Some people might find that kind of perfection boring...

290
00:20:46,835 --> 00:20:50,070
- day after day, year after year.
- That's what I thought at first.

291
00:20:50,071 --> 00:20:52,239
How can you like someone that perfect?

292
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,909
No potential for long-range likeability.

293
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:59,747
But then, she does have a few good traits.

294
00:20:59,748 --> 00:21:01,248
- All right.
- Such as?

295
00:21:01,249 --> 00:21:03,550
They got him.

296
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:06,119
When I hug her, even in public...

297
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,922
I don't have to let go right away.

298
00:21:08,923 --> 00:21:11,425
She lets me hold her as long as I want.

299
00:21:11,426 --> 00:21:15,429
- Batting second, the shortstop--
- What?

300
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:18,599
- Nothing.
- I forgot.

301
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,301
You and that yucky love stuff.

302
00:21:21,302 --> 00:21:23,482
You always get like that when it gets sentimental.

303
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:25,633
I do not.

304
00:21:27,308 --> 00:21:30,244
When we were--
When you and I were--

305
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:32,372
- When we were--
- Together?

306
00:21:36,651 --> 00:21:38,552
Did I, when--

307
00:21:38,553 --> 00:21:42,589
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

308
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:45,650
You pulled away when I tried to hug you in public.

309
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:53,700
I've changed.

310
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:56,226
I mean, I'm not the girl that I once was.

311
00:21:57,572 --> 00:21:59,173
Really?

312
00:21:59,174 --> 00:22:02,109
Any relationship over two weeks I should know about?

313
00:22:03,044 --> 00:22:05,444
This is not about longevity.

314
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:09,349
This is about...

315
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,752
being comfortable...

316
00:22:11,753 --> 00:22:13,744
with the yucky love stuff.

317
00:22:17,091 --> 00:22:18,692
All right.

318
00:22:18,693 --> 00:22:21,184
And I am.

319
00:22:24,025 --> 00:22:27,668
And it's wisdom born of pain

320
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:30,170
Yes, I've paid the price

321
00:22:30,171 --> 00:22:33,106
But look how much I've gained

322
00:22:33,107 --> 00:22:35,342
- If I have to
- Karaoke!

323
00:22:35,343 --> 00:22:37,177
- I can do anything
- Where did you find this place?

324
00:22:37,178 --> 00:22:39,680
The doorman told me.
And you are singing the song.

325
00:22:39,681 --> 00:22:44,184
I am strong I am invincible

326
00:22:44,185 --> 00:22:47,780
I am woman

327
00:22:53,862 --> 00:22:55,796
I didn't realize this was a karaoke bar.

328
00:22:56,865 --> 00:22:59,166
This is so great.
My two best girls.

329
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:02,369
- You folks thirsty?
- Margarita.

330
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,204
- Blended, no salt.
- She wants it straight up.

331
00:23:04,205 --> 00:23:05,873
- You?
- <i>Amstel</i> light.

332
00:23:05,874 --> 00:23:07,875
Two words for you.

333
00:23:07,876 --> 00:23:09,977
Margarita.

334
00:23:09,978 --> 00:23:11,639
Vespa.

335
00:23:13,214 --> 00:23:14,647
Florence.

336
00:23:16,384 --> 00:23:18,385
Me hanging on in the rain.

337
00:23:18,386 --> 00:23:21,355
- I love Florence.
- And the guy with the thing.

338
00:23:23,591 --> 00:23:25,092
Where was my pass?

339
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:28,061
- "No, the pier is for fishing!"
- "French kissing?"

340
00:23:28,062 --> 00:23:31,498
- "Fishing!"
- I've always loved Florence.

341
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:37,504
You Should take her there.
She's perky. She deserves a honeymoon.

342
00:23:40,408 --> 00:23:43,677
"If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento"?

343
00:23:43,678 --> 00:23:47,580
You're off the road in September, and
when does fall quarter start for you?

344
00:23:51,586 --> 00:23:55,716
I'm not coming back senior year.

345
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:03,797
Don't architects find a degree sort of an asset?

346
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:08,101
I travel every week. Got college ball,
motor sports, training camps.

347
00:24:08,102 --> 00:24:11,104
I think the most important thing is for us to be together.

348
00:24:11,105 --> 00:24:15,976
Say, Pinky, I wanna hear you sing.
Come on.

349
00:24:15,977 --> 00:24:18,241
Kimmy hates to sing.
She hates it.

350
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,318
All right, folks.
Everybody...

351
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:28,889
my bride-to-be here
is about to kick some ass on--

352
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,158
What?
It will be fun.

353
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:33,827
No, she doesn't want to, Michael.
Leave her alone.

354
00:24:33,828 --> 00:24:36,797
Come on.
Ladies and gentlemen...

355
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:40,834
Please give it up for the dazzling vocal stylings...

356
00:24:40,835 --> 00:24:43,167
of Miss Kimberly Wallace!

357
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:49,235
Come on.

358
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:08,662
I just don't know what to do with myself

359
00:25:08,663 --> 00:25:13,133
Don't know just what to do with myself

360
00:25:13,134 --> 00:25:17,304
I'm so used to doing

361
00:25:17,305 --> 00:25:19,673
Everything for you

362
00:25:19,674 --> 00:25:25,345
- You suck!
- Planning everything for two

363
00:25:25,346 --> 00:25:29,349
And now that we're through

364
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,151
I just don't know

365
00:25:31,152 --> 00:25:35,956
What to do with my time

366
00:25:35,957 --> 00:25:38,525
I'm so lonesome for you

367
00:25:38,526 --> 00:25:40,660
It's a crime

368
00:25:40,661 --> 00:25:44,324
Going to a movie

369
00:26:13,394 --> 00:26:17,064
If your new love

370
00:26:17,065 --> 00:26:19,733
Ever turns you down

371
00:26:19,734 --> 00:26:21,868
Come back

372
00:26:21,869 --> 00:26:27,068
I will be around just waiting for you

373
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:33,006
I just don't know what to do

374
00:26:34,248 --> 00:26:37,342
Like a summer rose

375
00:26:39,253 --> 00:26:42,689
It needs the sun and the rain

376
00:26:44,926 --> 00:26:50,263
I need your sweet love

377
00:26:50,264 --> 00:26:55,566
I need your sweet love to ease

378
00:26:58,272 --> 00:27:04,040
All the pain

379
00:27:10,284 --> 00:27:12,775
That was just terrible!

380
00:27:21,729 --> 00:27:25,298
"STEAKHOUSE" "PARK" "TAXI"
- You won't be lonely without us?
- Desperately.

381
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:28,301
- Maybe we don't have to go.
- Your grandmother's dinner?

382
00:27:28,302 --> 00:27:31,972
As bride-to-be,
she's got you on a technicality.

383
00:27:31,973 --> 00:27:37,310
I'd baby-sit you, but my loyalty
is to the bride in her time of need.

384
00:27:37,311 --> 00:27:41,815
- It's not really a time of need.
- If you're sure.

385
00:27:41,816 --> 00:27:45,980
- "Sure"?
- I'll stay with Michael it you're sure.

386
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:52,254
- Call me later?
- Of course.

387
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,924
- Bye.
- Have fun.

388
00:28:11,345 --> 00:28:14,014
Were you pretty shocked when I told you?

389
00:28:14,015 --> 00:28:15,949
Shocked? No.

390
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:20,687
A little.

391
00:28:20,688 --> 00:28:24,124
A lot.
I tell off the bed.

392
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,228
That explains the thump.

393
00:28:28,229 --> 00:28:30,459
You like her, don't you?

394
00:28:32,366 --> 00:28:35,869
- I do.
- That's enthusiastic.

395
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:39,306
I mean, she's--
She's great.

396
00:28:42,376 --> 00:28:46,546
She seriously can't sing a note.

397
00:28:46,547 --> 00:28:51,518
But to make that kind
of sacrifice--

398
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:56,590
- What? Leaving school?
- All of it.

399
00:28:56,591 --> 00:29:00,227
Putting her career on hold
to follow you around in this dumb job...

400
00:29:00,228 --> 00:29:03,063
where you travel 52 weeks a year...

401
00:29:03,064 --> 00:29:06,566
to places like College Station, Texas.

402
00:29:06,567 --> 00:29:10,704
- "Dumb job"?
- It's not a grown-up job.

403
00:29:10,705 --> 00:29:13,273
My job never bothered you before.

404
00:29:13,274 --> 00:29:17,344
It doesn't bother me now, but I'm not Kimmy.

405
00:29:17,345 --> 00:29:22,908
Her father owns the <i>Sox and cable sports</i>.

406
00:29:24,585 --> 00:29:28,588
I'm just surprised it hasn't come up, that's all.

407
00:29:28,589 --> 00:29:30,181
What?

408
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,060
The corner office with a view.

409
00:29:34,061 --> 00:29:36,930
You in a nice blue suit.

410
00:29:36,931 --> 00:29:41,268
Permanent Chicago address, somewhat close to Mom and Dad.

411
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:42,936
Never.

412
00:29:42,937 --> 00:29:45,599
She would never even think of that.

413
00:29:46,874 --> 00:29:48,808
You don't know her.

414
00:29:57,451 --> 00:29:59,619
- But Michael loves his job.
- Sure.

415
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,789
Bad games, bad pay, bad towns, bad flights...

416
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:05,292
bad hotels, real bad food...

417
00:30:05,293 --> 00:30:07,460
homeless, rootless, lonely...

418
00:30:07,461 --> 00:30:09,796
your copy makes it in one issue out of tour.

419
00:30:09,797 --> 00:30:11,798
What's not to love?

420
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:15,635
Why would he trade that for running,
say, a piece of the public relations...

421
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:19,472
at a powerful complex conglomerate like your father's?

422
00:30:19,473 --> 00:30:23,773
- That's what my father and I discussed.
- I'm not surprised.

423
00:30:25,813 --> 00:30:28,648
So do you think he'd really accept?

424
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:30,317
Michael?
A job like that?

425
00:30:30,318 --> 00:30:33,987
It would be the greatest thing that ever happened to him.

426
00:30:33,988 --> 00:30:36,489
Present company excepted.

427
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:41,361
This is what we do:
We make your dad a co-conspirator.

428
00:30:41,362 --> 00:30:43,363
Michael does a favor for Walter.

429
00:30:43,364 --> 00:30:45,999
Walter's reorganizing his public relations...

430
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,501
and needs a brilliant guy that he's close to...

431
00:30:48,502 --> 00:30:51,004
that he can completely trust.

432
00:30:51,005 --> 00:30:54,007
Then you beg.
'Michael, please do this for Daddy.

433
00:30:54,008 --> 00:30:57,500
It's only six months.
It would mean so much to me."

434
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:04,279
- He'll see right through it.
- Only if he wants to.

435
00:31:05,186 --> 00:31:06,686
At the end of six months...

436
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:09,489
he will be happy...

437
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,291
settled...

438
00:31:11,292 --> 00:31:13,021
successful.

439
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,141
Wow.

440
00:31:30,344 --> 00:31:32,879
You look beautiful.
Do you have a date later?

441
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,313
Never can tell.

442
00:31:35,683 --> 00:31:39,244
Just the way you look tonight Remember?

443
00:31:40,888 --> 00:31:44,187
Okay, kid, you're up.

444
00:31:54,068 --> 00:31:57,162
It's really my father who needs the favor.

445
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,244
He's reorganizing some of the divisions of the company.

446
00:32:04,245 --> 00:32:07,612
Public relations is a real problem area for him.

447
00:32:10,084 --> 00:32:13,713
It would only be six months maybe.

448
00:32:15,423 --> 00:32:19,759
- Or three or four.
- You knew about this?

449
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,753
I think you ought to listen to her.
It's her life too.

450
00:32:26,467 --> 00:32:29,469
You gonna tell me that Walter thought this one up?

451
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:33,606
Why don't you start by being honest one second.

452
00:32:33,607 --> 00:32:35,942
I am being honest.

453
00:32:35,943 --> 00:32:39,446
All of a sudden I'm supposed to drop out of school...

454
00:32:39,447 --> 00:32:41,548
forget my family, forget my career...

455
00:32:41,549 --> 00:32:46,119
- forget the things I had planned?
- Forgive me for screwing up your plans.

456
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,955
Glad I heard this before it's too Late.

457
00:32:48,956 --> 00:32:52,225
- What is that supposed to mean?
- What am I supposed to do with my life?

458
00:32:52,226 --> 00:32:55,462
I work in a low-paying, zero-respect job...

459
00:32:55,463 --> 00:32:58,591
which, unfortunately, I happen to love.

460
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:06,639
- It sounds like a great opportunity.
- Does it really?

461
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,143
How come you never took some sellout establishment job?

462
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,645
I'll tell you why, because that isn't you.

463
00:33:12,646 --> 00:33:15,315
- And it's not me either.
- If that's the way you feel--

464
00:33:15,316 --> 00:33:19,118
Damn straight that's how I feel!
Just come out and say it.

465
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:22,622
My job's not good enough.
I'm not good enough.

466
00:33:22,623 --> 00:33:26,923
- I never said that!
- Yes, you did.

467
00:33:29,497 --> 00:33:31,464
Great, Kim.

468
00:33:31,465 --> 00:33:35,492
Two days before our wedding, you lay
this on me. I'm supposed to roll over?

469
00:33:38,506 --> 00:33:42,008
Fine. I'm an insensitive.
Sexist asshole.

470
00:33:42,009 --> 00:33:43,840
You're better off without me.

471
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:50,483
You are so right.
I was so wrong.

472
00:33:50,484 --> 00:33:53,887
We settled this, and I reneged.
That just wasn't fair.

473
00:33:53,888 --> 00:33:58,525
You have to forgive me and forget
this happened or I'll just die.

474
00:33:58,526 --> 00:33:59,959
Please.

475
00:34:05,032 --> 00:34:06,897
I'm sorry.

476
00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:34,727
George and Werner are not in.

477
00:34:34,728 --> 00:34:37,063
Brevity is the order of the day.

478
00:34:37,064 --> 00:34:39,365
George, answer this, damn it

479
00:34:39,366 --> 00:34:42,902
I'm in a meltdown here!
She double-crossed me!

480
00:34:42,903 --> 00:34:47,240
The little twerp groveled She's so wrong for him.

481
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:52,078
Michael and I are the same person:
self-absorbed and vaguely loveable.

482
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,581
We deserve each other.
I'm running out of time.

483
00:34:54,582 --> 00:34:58,384
I'm completely out of sneaky ideas.
I have come to the end...

484
00:34:58,385 --> 00:35:00,254
of my rapidly fraying rope!

485
00:35:05,118 --> 00:35:07,260
You have got to think of something!

486
00:35:07,261 --> 00:35:10,856
- Coffee, anyone?
- That would be wonderful.

487
00:35:12,933 --> 00:35:16,596
"THE DRAKE"

488
00:35:47,901 --> 00:35:51,304
This is very Marcel Marceau.

489
00:35:51,305 --> 00:35:55,975
Now, relax. We don't want your face
coming off with it, do we?

490
00:35:55,976 --> 00:35:57,876
What a hideous room.

491
00:35:58,946 --> 00:36:02,245
Death by a mini-bar.
How glamorous.

492
00:36:05,986 --> 00:36:08,988
You flew all the way here.
You hate to fly.

493
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:13,126
I have to go back this evening.
We have a family thing in the Hamptons.

494
00:36:13,127 --> 00:36:15,061
You're butting in.

495
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:19,799
What I mean when I say she's annoyingly perfect...

496
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,669
is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection.

497
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:27,640
It is vulnerable and endearing.
And that is annoying as shit.

498
00:36:27,641 --> 00:36:29,642
You like her.

499
00:36:29,643 --> 00:36:31,770
It I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her.

500
00:36:33,013 --> 00:36:35,748
This is my whole life's happiness.

501
00:36:35,749 --> 00:36:37,683
I have to be ruthless.

502
00:36:38,919 --> 00:36:41,521
He was in love with me every day for nine years.

503
00:36:41,522 --> 00:36:43,523
I can make him happier than she can.

504
00:36:43,524 --> 00:36:45,692
I am breaking her heart in the short run...

505
00:36:45,693 --> 00:36:48,361
but really doing her a gigantic favor.

506
00:36:48,362 --> 00:36:53,129
She would be so miserable tagging along
after this insensitive doofus.

507
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:04,711
Do you really love him...

508
00:37:04,712 --> 00:37:06,877
or is this just about winning?

509
00:37:06,878 --> 00:37:08,313
Seriously.

510
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:16,222
In the beginning, it was mostly this prior claim.

511
00:37:16,223 --> 00:37:18,316
He belonged to me.***

512
00:37:20,728 --> 00:37:24,731
But now, when I'm with him...

513
00:37:24,732 --> 00:37:28,568
he's just so wonderful.

514
00:37:28,569 --> 00:37:33,072
How come I never knew that when I could have had him?

515
00:37:33,073 --> 00:37:36,668
It's amazing the clarity that comes
with psychotic jealousy.

516
00:37:39,413 --> 00:37:41,748
George, believe me...

517
00:37:41,749 --> 00:37:44,584
if he was feeling what I'm feeling...

518
00:37:44,585 --> 00:37:47,253
then he would know how I feel.

519
00:37:47,254 --> 00:37:49,756
It's horrible.

520
00:37:49,757 --> 00:37:51,349
What?

521
00:37:52,926 --> 00:37:55,360
Just tell him you love him.

522
00:37:57,765 --> 00:38:02,268
Tell him you've loved him for nine years...

523
00:38:02,269 --> 00:38:04,863
but you were afraid of love.

524
00:38:06,273 --> 00:38:09,609
Tell him you were afraid of love, afraid of needing.

525
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:12,445
- Needing what?
- To belong to someone.

526
00:38:12,446 --> 00:38:14,614
We all are, sweetheart.

527
00:38:14,615 --> 00:38:17,283
I'm sorry about that.

528
00:38:17,284 --> 00:38:22,855
Tell him this is the worst, cruelest,
dumbest moment to do this to him...

529
00:38:22,856 --> 00:38:24,791
but there it is.

530
00:38:24,792 --> 00:38:26,885
He's got to choose.

531
00:38:28,128 --> 00:38:31,297
Tell him the actual truth?

532
00:38:31,298 --> 00:38:35,234
Maybe not the actual truth.

533
00:38:35,235 --> 00:38:38,864
Highlights.

534
00:38:44,478 --> 00:38:47,447
Arms at your sides, Please.

535
00:38:59,493 --> 00:39:02,161
- Good morning.
- I have to talk to you.

536
00:39:02,162 --> 00:39:05,832
- You don't like the suit?
- That's not what I have to talk about.

537
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:08,097
One thing first.
Excuse me.

538
00:39:14,675 --> 00:39:18,177
- Guard this with your life.
- What is it?

539
00:39:18,178 --> 00:39:20,680
- The ring.
- Why are you giving it to me?

540
00:39:20,681 --> 00:39:23,683
- I don't trust Scotty with it.
- I don't think--

541
00:39:23,684 --> 00:39:25,518
Please.

542
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:28,020
You're practically the best man anyway.

543
00:39:28,021 --> 00:39:31,115
- Thank you.
- Open it.

544
00:39:32,693 --> 00:39:34,160
Will she like it?

545
00:39:41,034 --> 00:39:43,970
- What did you want to talk about?
- What?

546
00:39:43,971 --> 00:39:45,529
You wanted to talk about something?

547
00:39:50,878 --> 00:39:54,013
We've known each other
a long time, right? Twenty years?

548
00:39:54,014 --> 00:39:57,216
Not that long, but a long time.

549
00:39:57,217 --> 00:39:59,218
And in that time...

550
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:03,747
we've grown close.

551
00:40:04,892 --> 00:40:07,560
Very close.
Do you know what I mean?

552
00:40:07,561 --> 00:40:10,189
- I think so.
- Good. So do I.

553
00:40:10,898 --> 00:40:13,492
So sometimes--

554
00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:17,536
could you excuse us?

555
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,443
Sometimes...

556
00:40:24,444 --> 00:40:27,079
people think...

557
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,749
they know how they feel about each other...

558
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,183
but they don't...

559
00:40:32,753 --> 00:40:34,220
until...

560
00:40:35,756 --> 00:40:37,246
until they do.

561
00:40:39,092 --> 00:40:40,525
I have a point.

562
00:40:41,762 --> 00:40:44,363
- Am I getting to it?
- Why don't you?

563
00:40:44,364 --> 00:40:47,595
Whatever it is you have to say can't be that big a deal.

564
00:40:51,438 --> 00:40:56,102
"A big deal" is a relative term.

565
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,824
Who's that guy?

566
00:41:14,461 --> 00:41:17,663
It's George. I've told you
about George. He's my editor.

567
00:41:17,664 --> 00:41:19,928
What's he doing here?
You working this weekend?

568
00:41:23,637 --> 00:41:27,232
- He's here to be with me.
- Why?

569
00:41:28,642 --> 00:41:33,813
Because he's my friend.
He's my good friend.

570
00:41:33,814 --> 00:41:35,406
My best friend these days.

571
00:41:38,986 --> 00:41:41,147
You've been busy.

572
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:47,290
So all of this has been about George?

573
00:42:08,348 --> 00:42:10,349
I'm speechless.

574
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,351
That's Jules.

575
00:42:12,352 --> 00:42:13,853
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

576
00:42:13,854 --> 00:42:15,888
What?

577
00:42:15,889 --> 00:42:19,689
I told him, puppy. If we're engaged,
we Shouldn't be ashamed of it.

578
00:42:21,828 --> 00:42:25,698
He's racing back to New York.
He just came in for a few hours...

579
00:42:25,699 --> 00:42:27,963
to fuck me.

580
00:42:32,873 --> 00:42:35,341
Takes a few hours.

581
00:42:38,211 --> 00:42:39,644
God.

582
00:42:42,549 --> 00:42:44,717
Give me your ring.
Give it to me!

583
00:42:44,718 --> 00:42:44,718
When you ask a girl to marry you,
you have to give an engagement ring.

584
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:51,557
I can't believe you're doing this to me.
I've come all this way to help you.

585
00:42:51,558 --> 00:42:55,153
- You're insane!
- For one day find me irresistible.

586
00:43:03,637 --> 00:43:05,070
Stop it.

587
00:43:09,409 --> 00:43:11,206
Is something wrong?

588
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:17,183
I guess it's just the way
you've always talked about George.

589
00:43:17,184 --> 00:43:20,719
It always seemed...

590
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,422
seemed like--

591
00:43:23,423 --> 00:43:27,359
- It sounded like George was--
- Gay?

592
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,850
Actually, yes.

593
00:43:30,597 --> 00:43:33,225
Common misconception.

594
00:43:34,935 --> 00:43:37,303
It is.

595
00:43:37,304 --> 00:43:42,799
George likes to pretend that he's gay.

596
00:43:48,281 --> 00:43:50,306
And why would you do that?

597
00:43:52,055 --> 00:43:53,953
I find it attracts women.

598
00:43:53,954 --> 00:43:56,555
Indeed.
Worked for me.

599
00:43:56,556 --> 00:43:58,046
Big time.

600
00:44:02,129 --> 00:44:04,290
Right.

601
00:44:09,803 --> 00:44:12,237
Oh, my God.
Race you to the altar.

602
00:44:13,473 --> 00:44:15,541
- Underplay.
- Got it.

603
00:44:15,542 --> 00:44:17,643
I'm Jules' fiance, George.

604
00:44:17,644 --> 00:44:21,981
Just in town for a quick pre-conjugal
visit, it you catch my drift.

605
00:44:21,982 --> 00:44:23,415
I do.

606
00:44:24,651 --> 00:44:27,153
- You're going to humiliate me.
- Only if I can.

607
00:44:27,154 --> 00:44:29,788
Just one thing.
Stay away from--

608
00:44:29,789 --> 00:44:32,417
George! Oh, my God!

609
00:44:34,828 --> 00:44:39,165
- I don't know why I'm so carried away.
- Me neither.

610
00:44:39,166 --> 00:44:40,599
It's so--

611
00:44:42,335 --> 00:44:44,336
Against God's plan?

612
00:44:44,337 --> 00:44:47,306
No! It's just wonderful!

613
00:44:47,307 --> 00:44:49,605
It's so wonderful!

614
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,113
Mom!

615
00:44:59,019 --> 00:45:02,521
- What?
- You have to meet George.

616
00:45:02,522 --> 00:45:05,024
You must be Kimmy's little sister.

617
00:45:05,025 --> 00:45:08,627
Julianne's fiance.
They're going to be married.

618
00:45:08,628 --> 00:45:10,863
- What's going on?
- Julianne's getting married.

619
00:45:10,864 --> 00:45:13,399
- Why didn't you tell us?
- There hasn't been time.

620
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,869
I wanted to. I wanted
to shout it from the rooftops...

621
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:20,539
but Jules said, "No, Pumpkin, no.

622
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,041
This is Kimmy's day.

623
00:45:22,042 --> 00:45:24,476
Let's not take the attention away from Kimmy.

624
00:45:25,545 --> 00:45:27,546
Dear, sweet...

625
00:45:27,547 --> 00:45:30,175
adorable, chocolate-covered Kimmy."

626
00:45:31,051 --> 00:45:33,819
Those were her very words.

627
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:35,821
I think I'm gonna cry.

628
00:45:35,822 --> 00:45:37,723
Me too.

629
00:45:37,724 --> 00:45:40,559
This is so sweet of you to come to our rehearsal.

630
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,695
I insist you stay for lunch.

631
00:45:42,696 --> 00:45:44,663
- No, absolutely--
- Love to.

632
00:45:44,664 --> 00:45:48,334
Love the bag, love the shoes,
love everything. Love to.

633
00:45:48,335 --> 00:45:52,328
- Darling, what about your flight?
- Canceled.

634
00:45:58,578 --> 00:46:02,414
I can tell you this now, but I was very worried about you.

635
00:46:02,415 --> 00:46:04,083
About me?

636
00:46:04,084 --> 00:46:07,019
All those stories that Michael told me were hilarious...

637
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:11,056
but all those broken relationships, all those men.

638
00:46:11,057 --> 00:46:14,393
It must have hurt going through so many
guys and never finding the right one.

639
00:46:14,394 --> 00:46:18,125
She couldn't sit down for seven years
until she met teensy-weensy little me.

640
00:46:19,299 --> 00:46:22,632
And the man of your dreams was always there.

641
00:46:25,105 --> 00:46:27,767
She's talking about me.

642
00:46:28,608 --> 00:46:30,276
Yes, Darling?

643
00:46:30,277 --> 00:46:34,613
- How did you and Julianne meet?
- George is my editor.

644
00:46:34,614 --> 00:46:36,949
But, Poopy, we met a long time before that.

645
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:40,719
Actually, it's a very romantic story.

646
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,149
Would you like to tell it, Sweet Pea?

647
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:46,384
- It's private.
- Not anymore.

648
00:46:47,691 --> 00:46:51,130
I first met Julianne...

649
00:46:51,131 --> 00:46:53,395
in a mental institution.

650
00:46:54,801 --> 00:46:57,136
Julianne was there visiting some French chef...

651
00:46:57,137 --> 00:46:59,305
she'd sent insane with a bad review...

652
00:46:59,306 --> 00:47:01,774
and I was there visiting Dionne Warwick.

653
00:47:03,276 --> 00:47:05,678
He thought he was Dionne Warwick.

654
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:09,848
- Who is Dionne Warwick?
- Sacrilege, darling.

655
00:47:09,849 --> 00:47:11,517
She's Whitney Houston's aunt.

656
00:47:11,518 --> 00:47:13,819
She's very good on the Psychic Friends Network.

657
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:18,689
- Isn't she?
- Do you know the way to San Jose

658
00:47:24,831 --> 00:47:28,000
There I was with Dionne.
His real name, by the way, is Jerry.

659
00:47:28,001 --> 00:47:31,503
We were having a sing-along,
then suddenly...

660
00:47:31,504 --> 00:47:35,341
breezing through the doors from the shock therapy room...

661
00:47:35,342 --> 00:47:37,009
I saw her.

662
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:39,638
A vision in pink.

663
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:44,516
- You don't wear pink.
- She does.

664
00:47:44,517 --> 00:47:47,019
Sometimes she does wear pink.

665
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:49,788
- You do.
- I do.

666
00:47:49,789 --> 00:47:52,057
I said to Dionne...

667
00:47:52,058 --> 00:47:55,494
"Dionne, who is this vision?

668
00:47:55,495 --> 00:47:59,365
Surely, she must be the understudy
to some fabulous Broadway star.

669
00:47:59,366 --> 00:48:01,867
Look at her skin.
Who does her hair?"

670
00:48:01,868 --> 00:48:04,770
- In that moment, I knew.
- We don't all need to know--

671
00:48:04,771 --> 00:48:06,204
We do!

672
00:48:09,876 --> 00:48:13,545
- I'm very curious.
- They do.

673
00:48:13,546 --> 00:48:16,048
I knew...

674
00:48:16,049 --> 00:48:18,717
that someday we'd end up like this:

675
00:48:18,718 --> 00:48:21,553
like some glittering...

676
00:48:21,554 --> 00:48:25,353
Doris Day-Rock Hudson
extravaganza.

677
00:48:25,354 --> 00:48:28,494
I said to Dionne...

678
00:48:28,495 --> 00:48:31,897
"Dionne, I'm in love.

679
00:48:31,898 --> 00:48:34,733
Could this siren love me?

680
00:48:34,734 --> 00:48:37,569
Are the gods that kind?"

681
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:43,008
And Dionne turned to me,
opened her lovely eyes and said...

682
00:48:49,616 --> 00:48:51,174
What did she say?

683
00:48:53,586 --> 00:48:55,747
The moment I wake up

684
00:48:58,858 --> 00:49:01,794
Before I put on my makeup

685
00:49:01,795 --> 00:49:05,060
I say a little prayer for you

686
00:49:07,133 --> 00:49:09,601
While combing my hair now

687
00:49:11,104 --> 00:49:14,206
While wondering what dress to wear now

688
00:49:14,207 --> 00:49:17,776
I say a little prayer for you

689
00:49:17,777 --> 00:49:21,380
Forever and ever you'll stay in my heart

690
00:49:21,381 --> 00:49:23,048
And I will love you

691
00:49:23,049 --> 00:49:25,951
Forever and ever
We never will part

692
00:49:25,952 --> 00:49:27,453
Oh, how I love you

693
00:49:27,454 --> 00:49:30,456
Together forever
That's how it must be

694
00:49:30,457 --> 00:49:33,492
To live without you would only mean

695
00:49:33,493 --> 00:49:36,228
Heartbreak for me

696
00:49:36,229 --> 00:49:38,390
Go, Granddaddy!

697
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,791
I run for the bus, dear

698
00:49:43,903 --> 00:49:47,270
While riding I think of us, dear

699
00:49:51,478 --> 00:49:53,639
At work I just take time

700
00:49:54,747 --> 00:49:57,910
And all through my coffee break time

701
00:50:20,607 --> 00:50:22,939
My darling, believe me

702
00:50:24,177 --> 00:50:29,876
For me there is no one but you

703
00:50:29,877 --> 00:50:34,486
- Please love me too
- Answer his prayer

704
00:50:34,487 --> 00:50:37,523
- And I'm in love with you
- Answer his prayer now

705
00:50:37,524 --> 00:50:39,617
Answer my prayer, baby

706
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:43,454
Say you love me too

707
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:09,854
all right, now!

708
00:51:11,891 --> 00:51:14,560
- Heartbreak for you, actually.
- You've made your point.

709
00:51:14,561 --> 00:51:19,931
Get on your plane. I'll call at the turn
of the century when I've forgiven you.

710
00:51:22,289 --> 00:51:25,737
- It never would have worked out.
- Because it was dishonest.

711
00:51:25,738 --> 00:51:27,228
Different temperaments.

712
00:51:30,243 --> 00:51:33,110
Look, tell him you love him.

713
00:51:34,414 --> 00:51:36,348
Bite the bullet.

714
00:51:47,594 --> 00:51:49,428
What will he do?

715
00:51:49,429 --> 00:51:51,363
"BE CAREFUL. WATCH YOUR STEP"

716
00:51:58,605 --> 00:52:01,273
He'll choose Kim.

717
00:52:01,274 --> 00:52:04,209
You'll stand beside her at the wedding...

718
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:07,372
kiss him good-bye and go home.

719
00:52:07,373 --> 00:52:11,708
That's what you came here to do.

720
00:52:12,952 --> 00:52:14,886
So do it.

721
00:52:31,204 --> 00:52:34,473
George isn't my fiance, Michael.

722
00:52:34,474 --> 00:52:36,274
It's been over for ages...

723
00:52:36,275 --> 00:52:38,477
but he can't accept it.

724
00:52:38,478 --> 00:52:41,313
I'd built you up so much...

725
00:52:41,314 --> 00:52:44,583
I couldn't let him lose face in front of you.

726
00:52:44,584 --> 00:52:50,079
He could never stack up to the one man
I measure everyone against.

727
00:52:56,329 --> 00:52:58,263
This is strange.

728
00:52:59,832 --> 00:53:02,333
I gotta tell you, when you--

729
00:53:02,334 --> 00:53:05,429
When you told me that you were marrying George...

730
00:53:07,507 --> 00:53:11,034
I got this really strange--

731
00:53:14,013 --> 00:53:15,947
You were jealous?

732
00:53:21,954 --> 00:53:23,615
Crazy jealous.

733
00:53:25,722 --> 00:53:27,158
I'm sorry.

734
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,997
Can we maybe spend some time alone this afternoon?

735
00:53:40,506 --> 00:53:42,997
Would that be ail right?

736
00:54:10,369 --> 00:54:14,907
I've been thinking a lot
the Last couple of days, about us.

737
00:54:14,908 --> 00:54:17,005
Have you?

738
00:54:20,947 --> 00:54:24,178
- There are a lot of memories.
- It's more than that.

739
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:30,678
It's kind of embarrassing to say it this way, but...

740
00:54:32,225 --> 00:54:35,327
you've sort of been, you know...

741
00:54:35,328 --> 00:54:37,990
the woman in my life.

742
00:54:39,899 --> 00:54:42,968
You've been the man in mine.

743
00:54:42,969 --> 00:54:46,037
And I was thinking this could be our last time...

744
00:54:46,038 --> 00:54:49,030
alone together, you know?

745
00:54:51,644 --> 00:54:54,179
Except for that hot affair we'll have twice a year.

746
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:56,114
Except for that.

747
00:55:03,623 --> 00:55:08,593
I mean, you commit to this wedding...

748
00:55:08,594 --> 00:55:13,298
and then it seems like there's this momentum...

749
00:55:13,299 --> 00:55:15,859
and then you forget you chose it.

750
00:55:21,607 --> 00:55:23,842
You and I didn't--

751
00:55:23,843 --> 00:55:28,313
In our relationships with other people...

752
00:55:28,314 --> 00:55:32,751
we didn't use the word love a lot, did we?

753
00:55:35,888 --> 00:55:38,957
Kimmy says it you love someone...

754
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:41,526
you say it.

755
00:55:41,527 --> 00:55:43,688
You say it right then, out loud.

756
00:55:44,997 --> 00:55:49,100
Otherwise,
the moment just--

757
00:55:49,101 --> 00:55:51,035
Passes you by.

758
00:56:13,593 --> 00:56:15,527
We don't even have a song.

759
00:56:16,829 --> 00:56:20,856
Kimmy and I don't have a song.

760
00:56:22,335 --> 00:56:24,303
Do you think that's a bad sign?

761
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,141
Someday

762
00:56:30,142 --> 00:56:33,144
When I'm awfully low

763
00:56:33,145 --> 00:56:35,513
And the world is cold

764
00:56:35,514 --> 00:56:40,076
I will feel a glow just thinking of you

765
00:56:41,954 --> 00:56:47,085
And the way you look tonight

766
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,228
Is your dance card tilled?

767
00:56:50,229 --> 00:56:53,598
I'd have to check.
I keep it on <i>Powerbook</i> these days.

768
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:55,533
Is that right?

769
00:56:58,671 --> 00:57:00,672
With each word

770
00:57:00,673 --> 00:57:03,665
Your tenderness grows

771
00:57:05,077 --> 00:57:09,070
Tearing my fears apart

772
00:57:11,183 --> 00:57:16,121
With each laugh that wrinkles your nose

773
00:57:16,122 --> 00:57:19,956
Touches my foolish heart

774
00:57:58,764 --> 00:58:00,197
Excuse me.

775
00:58:03,636 --> 00:58:06,972
- I thought Michael was picking me up.
- I said I'd drop you at the stag.

776
00:58:06,973 --> 00:58:10,141
He's got a lot to do.
I'm the unofficial best man.

777
00:58:10,142 --> 00:58:12,711
Of course.

778
00:58:12,712 --> 00:58:17,716
Kim said when Michael turned the job
down that there was no friction.

779
00:58:17,717 --> 00:58:19,851
Friction? No.

780
00:58:19,852 --> 00:58:21,686
Good.

781
00:58:21,687 --> 00:58:24,489
I haven't caused a problem, have I?

782
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:26,822
You haven't. Nobody has.

783
00:58:28,494 --> 00:58:31,296
Listen, you're just a little bit early.

784
00:58:31,297 --> 00:58:33,298
Actually, I needed to make some phone calls.

785
00:58:33,299 --> 00:58:36,067
- Is it possible to use your office?
- Of course.

786
00:58:36,068 --> 00:58:38,593
- At the end of the hall on the left.
- Thank you.

787
00:58:40,072 --> 00:58:42,370
Take your time.

788
00:58:50,182 --> 00:58:52,116
E-mall.

789
00:58:53,319 --> 00:58:56,652
"FILE" "NEW LETTER" "OPEN" "CLOSE"
New letter.

790
00:59:03,195 --> 00:59:07,799
To: Eric Isaacson...

791
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:13,738
"MAIL OUT"
Senior editor, <i>Sport Magazine</i>.

792
00:59:13,739 --> 00:59:17,505
From: Walter Wallace.

793
00:59:19,578 --> 00:59:23,381
You can do this. It's easy.
Just do it fast, get it over with.

794
00:59:23,382 --> 00:59:25,316
It's like it never happened.

795
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:30,522
Eric, I need a favor.

796
00:59:30,523 --> 00:59:34,826
My daughter's every happiness...

797
00:59:34,827 --> 00:59:36,661
is in your hands.

798
00:59:36,662 --> 00:59:40,632
I have offered Mike O'Neal...

799
00:59:40,633 --> 00:59:43,334
my new son-in-Law...

800
00:59:43,335 --> 00:59:46,137
a great opportunity...

801
00:59:46,138 --> 00:59:48,339
in my company.

802
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:51,843
To his own detriment...

803
00:59:51,844 --> 00:59:53,845
Michael will not...

804
00:59:53,846 --> 00:59:57,849
accept our offer...

805
00:59:57,850 --> 01:00:01,684
while he works for you.

806
01:00:26,412 --> 01:00:29,848
My daughter joins me in this plea...

807
01:00:29,849 --> 01:00:33,518
for your cooperation.

808
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:37,755
With gratitude, Walter.

809
01:00:37,756 --> 01:00:39,724
"DO YOU WISH TO SEND?"
"YES" "NO"

810
01:00:40,893 --> 01:00:43,987
Why would I send this?
He'd get tired.

811
01:00:46,699 --> 01:00:48,428
"SAVE FOR LATER"
"DELETE"

812
01:00:52,271 --> 01:00:53,704
Save for later.

813
01:00:58,811 --> 01:01:00,678
It's not like I'm sending it.

814
01:01:00,679 --> 01:01:03,648
I'm just saving it for a few hours...

815
01:01:03,649 --> 01:01:06,518
till we come back here and...

816
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:08,353
Michael can see it.

817
01:01:08,354 --> 01:01:10,686
Perfectly harmless.

818
01:01:50,162 --> 01:01:51,595
"WALLACE COMPANY"

819
01:02:03,008 --> 01:02:06,511
Send out this, this, not this, this.

820
01:02:06,512 --> 01:02:08,479
That's it.

821
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:13,017
I'm holding tour or five e-mails
I wrote over lunch. Send those too.

822
01:02:13,018 --> 01:02:16,421
- Yes, sir.
- Bye.

823
01:02:16,422 --> 01:02:18,322
All set?

824
01:02:19,758 --> 01:02:22,327
I can't believe this!
Did you try every key?

825
01:02:22,328 --> 01:02:24,729
It's no big deal.
She just gave us the wrong keys.

826
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:28,700
There's got to be a janitor or a guard...

827
01:02:28,701 --> 01:02:32,270
or a cleaning woman
or, you know, some kind of--

828
01:02:32,271 --> 01:02:37,075
Somebody has to be in this building!
I need a brick.

829
01:02:37,076 --> 01:02:39,374
What's the big deal about getting this tile tonight?

830
01:02:40,846 --> 01:02:43,214
- I'm up against a deadline.
- Me too.

831
01:02:43,215 --> 01:02:46,150
- I'm getting married tomorrow.
- That's my point!

832
01:02:46,151 --> 01:02:48,586
Everybody will be busy with more important things...

833
01:02:48,587 --> 01:02:51,155
and this is really my last chance.

834
01:02:51,156 --> 01:02:54,192
If I could just get up to Walter's
office, they're by the computer.

835
01:02:54,193 --> 01:02:57,528
Then I could just e-mail
those figures right out now!

836
01:02:57,529 --> 01:02:59,297
Tomorrow's Sunday.

837
01:02:59,298 --> 01:03:01,366
Nobody's doing business.

838
01:03:01,367 --> 01:03:05,895
Monday morning, crack of dawn,
Walter will walk you right up there.

839
01:03:07,206 --> 01:03:09,140
Give it up, kid.

840
01:03:10,709 --> 01:03:12,142
Can't win them all.

841
01:03:26,158 --> 01:03:27,321
Good night.

842
01:03:36,101 --> 01:03:39,867
This thing mean that much to you?

843
01:03:42,441 --> 01:03:44,609
We'll use the phone in your room.

844
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:46,944
Walter's probably not even asleep.

845
01:03:46,945 --> 01:03:49,947
- I'll drive you up there.
- Thank you!

846
01:03:49,948 --> 01:03:53,251
We'll get the right key, and we'll go back to the office.

847
01:03:53,252 --> 01:03:56,020
If I fall asleep on the altar tomorrow,
you'd better be there.

848
01:03:56,021 --> 01:03:57,922
I'll be there.

849
01:03:57,923 --> 01:04:03,094
These are all from Eric.
This fax is from Eric too.

850
01:04:03,095 --> 01:04:05,663
My wedding. You'd think my boss
would leave me alone.

851
01:04:05,664 --> 01:04:07,598
Maybe it's Congratulations.

852
01:04:18,377 --> 01:04:20,106
What is it?

853
01:04:26,919 --> 01:04:30,021
"Mike, I can't believe I'm doing this to
you on the night before your wedding...

854
01:04:30,022 --> 01:04:34,325
but I think you need and deserve...

855
01:04:34,326 --> 01:04:36,260
to know what you're marrying into.

856
01:04:40,566 --> 01:04:44,127
I received the following e-mail
this afternoon:

857
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:49,296
'Eric, I need a favor.
My daughter's every--"'

858
01:04:51,477 --> 01:04:53,878
Isabelle, I need to talk to Kim.

859
01:04:53,879 --> 01:04:56,414
- Is anything wrong?
- No, I'm just tired.

860
01:04:56,415 --> 01:04:59,111
Please put her on.
Thanks.

861
01:05:02,654 --> 01:05:04,588
Could you give me a minute?

862
01:05:06,392 --> 01:05:07,825
Please?

863
01:05:55,741 --> 01:05:58,539
Excuse me, miss.
Are you locked out?

864
01:06:01,814 --> 01:06:05,215
Just stepped out.
It's a no-smoking room.

865
01:06:07,586 --> 01:06:09,821
It's a nonsmoking floor too.

866
01:06:09,822 --> 01:06:13,624
Maybe you could go down to the lobby.

867
01:06:13,625 --> 01:06:15,650
Why don't you have me arrested?

868
01:06:17,896 --> 01:06:19,530
I mean it.

869
01:06:19,531 --> 01:06:23,228
I am a dangerous, criminal person.

870
01:06:25,604 --> 01:06:28,232
I do bad things to honest people.

871
01:06:30,676 --> 01:06:33,377
You can make a citizen's arrest.
I wouldn't struggle.

872
01:06:33,378 --> 01:06:35,869
It'd be like getting AI Capone on tax evasion.

873
01:06:44,356 --> 01:06:46,586
Can I help you, miss?

874
01:06:51,897 --> 01:06:54,058
Do you smoke, Richard?

875
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,368
Yes, I do, but--

876
01:06:57,369 --> 01:06:59,166
It's a nonsmoking floor.

877
01:07:02,407 --> 01:07:04,341
But you know what?

878
01:07:26,331 --> 01:07:31,667
You know, my grandmother always said...

879
01:07:33,772 --> 01:07:36,741
"This too shall pass."

880
01:07:38,145 --> 01:07:41,578
Thanks, Richard.

881
01:08:07,072 --> 01:08:10,408
I want you to quit this shit.

882
01:08:10,409 --> 01:08:11,842
It'll kill you.

883
01:08:16,381 --> 01:08:17,814
What happened?

884
01:08:20,352 --> 01:08:23,220
It's over.
She denied it.

885
01:08:23,221 --> 01:08:26,157
She said I was crazy and paranoid.

886
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:29,193
A bad combination.

887
01:08:29,194 --> 01:08:30,728
There's a big...

888
01:08:30,729 --> 01:08:34,432
brunch tomorrow morning at her parents' house.

889
01:08:34,433 --> 01:08:37,197
She said, "How could I call it off?

890
01:08:39,504 --> 01:08:41,495
What am I supposed
to tell everyone?"

891
01:08:43,275 --> 01:08:45,607
It's for the best.
It really is.

892
01:08:46,445 --> 01:08:48,379
She was right.

893
01:08:50,582 --> 01:08:52,550
I am crazy...

894
01:08:55,053 --> 01:08:57,544
to fall for someone I hardly knew.

895
01:09:02,861 --> 01:09:04,761
I'm so glad you're here.

896
01:09:11,903 --> 01:09:15,168
Have you still got that ring?

897
01:09:26,585 --> 01:09:29,418
I tried it on, and it won't come off.

898
01:10:07,893 --> 01:10:11,954
Why don't we take a walk or have some food sent up?

899
01:10:14,833 --> 01:10:17,068
I just want to be alone.

900
01:10:17,069 --> 01:10:19,403
Is that okay?

901
01:10:19,404 --> 01:10:20,837
Sure.

902
01:10:23,942 --> 01:10:29,080
Maybe I'll go back to New York
for awhile and hang with you.

903
01:10:29,081 --> 01:10:33,884
Eric will understand.
Or we could go somewhere...

904
01:10:33,885 --> 01:10:35,318
if you want.

905
01:10:36,788 --> 01:10:39,484
"If San Antonio
sweeps Sacramento--"

906
01:10:40,926 --> 01:10:42,860
I've never been to Texas.

907
01:11:31,943 --> 01:11:33,877
"Brown"

908
01:11:52,798 --> 01:11:54,231
You what?

909
01:12:16,888 --> 01:12:18,913
- Can I try that?
- Sure.

910
01:12:29,701 --> 01:12:31,760
- Excuse me.
- Good luck.

911
01:12:34,906 --> 01:12:37,208
So this is your basic
call-off-the-wedding party?

912
01:12:37,209 --> 01:12:40,911
I came here to confront everybody.
I won't slink away like some coward.

913
01:12:40,912 --> 01:12:43,681
Besides, she hasn't told anyone.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

914
01:12:43,682 --> 01:12:47,778
There is a wedding at 6:00.

915
01:12:54,559 --> 01:12:59,758
Have you changed your mind?
Do you want to marry Kimmy?

916
01:13:03,034 --> 01:13:06,561
I made a decision.
It's over.

917
01:13:08,473 --> 01:13:10,407
I'll go tell them.

918
01:13:12,577 --> 01:13:16,673
First, do you think she's all right?

919
01:13:17,616 --> 01:13:19,811
Could you check on her for me?

920
01:13:23,722 --> 01:13:26,714
These are the most beautiful flowers I've ever seen.

921
01:13:30,462 --> 01:13:31,895
How is he?

922
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:37,334
He's sort of wondering...

923
01:13:37,335 --> 01:13:40,634
why you haven't told your parents that the wedding's off.

924
01:13:42,274 --> 01:13:46,043
I don't know. I'm still hoping
for a miracle, I suppose.

925
01:13:46,044 --> 01:13:49,613
How could he think that
my father and I would do such a thing?

926
01:13:49,614 --> 01:13:52,708
I only minored in psych, you understand, but...

927
01:13:54,486 --> 01:13:57,655
maybe Michael couldn't commit to this marriage...

928
01:13:57,656 --> 01:14:00,391
so he created...

929
01:14:00,392 --> 01:14:01,892
a delusion...

930
01:14:01,893 --> 01:14:04,862
produced an unconscious, psychosomatic...

931
01:14:04,863 --> 01:14:06,797
manifestation of--

932
01:14:09,534 --> 01:14:11,126
I'm better with food.

933
01:14:13,672 --> 01:14:18,309
You're Michael.
You're in a fancy French restaurant.

934
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:21,712
You order...

935
01:14:21,713 --> 01:14:23,806
crטme brulיe for dessert.

936
01:14:24,883 --> 01:14:27,718
It's beautiful. It's sweet.

937
01:14:27,719 --> 01:14:31,455
It's irritatingly perfect.

938
01:14:31,456 --> 01:14:34,124
Suddenly, Michael realizes...

939
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:36,860
he doesn't want crטme brulיe.

940
01:14:36,861 --> 01:14:41,696
- He wants something else.
- What does he want?

941
01:14:44,002 --> 01:14:46,732
- Jell-O.
- "Jell-O"?

942
01:14:47,939 --> 01:14:52,309
- Why Jell-O?
- He's comfortable with Jell-O.

943
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:55,612
Jell-O makes him comfortable.

944
01:14:55,613 --> 01:14:57,815
I realize compared to crטme brulיe...

945
01:14:57,816 --> 01:15:00,785
it's Jell-O,
but maybe that's what he needs.

946
01:15:02,821 --> 01:15:04,379
I could be Jell-O.

947
01:15:06,024 --> 01:15:08,692
Crטme brulיe can never be Jell-O.

948
01:15:08,693 --> 01:15:11,462
You could never be Jell-O.

949
01:15:11,463 --> 01:15:14,732
- I have to be Jell-O.
- You'll never be Jell-O.

950
01:15:14,733 --> 01:15:19,937
Tell your parents. If you're waiting
for that "do you take this man" part...

951
01:15:19,938 --> 01:15:22,133
- it's considered poor form.
- I love him.

952
01:15:23,341 --> 01:15:25,743
Whatever delusions I drove Michael to...

953
01:15:25,744 --> 01:15:27,745
there's truth at the heart of it.

954
01:15:27,746 --> 01:15:31,081
I want him to work for my father.

955
01:15:31,082 --> 01:15:34,245
I want to stay in school, and I want a life of my own.

956
01:15:35,453 --> 01:15:39,219
Please, tell him it's my fault and I love him.

957
01:15:40,658 --> 01:15:42,956
You're the only person that I trust.

958
01:15:49,034 --> 01:15:51,764
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

959
01:16:04,883 --> 01:16:07,084
How is she?

960
01:16:07,085 --> 01:16:10,452
- Knock it off!
- Yes, sir!

961
01:16:12,457 --> 01:16:14,858
- I asked you--
- She admits that it's her fault.

962
01:16:14,859 --> 01:16:17,487
Totally, completely, inexcusably her fault.

963
01:16:20,899 --> 01:16:22,867
Do you think she still loves me?

964
01:16:26,304 --> 01:16:29,826
Love is a strong word...

965
01:16:29,827 --> 01:16:32,476
and I don't know that
I'm necessarily qualified--

966
01:16:32,477 --> 01:16:36,580
I guess I wouldn't be totally off base
it I said that, in her way...

967
01:16:36,581 --> 01:16:39,379
she does possess
strong feelings--

968
01:16:45,123 --> 01:16:47,057
Sure, she does.

969
01:16:47,959 --> 01:16:49,960
She's crazy about you.

970
01:16:49,961 --> 01:16:53,988
You fill up my senses

971
01:16:54,966 --> 01:16:58,629
Like a night in the forest

972
01:17:00,071 --> 01:17:05,476
Like the mountains in springtime

973
01:17:05,477 --> 01:17:08,145
Like a walk in the rain

974
01:17:08,146 --> 01:17:10,478
Tell her I'll marry her
at 6:00...

975
01:17:11,549 --> 01:17:13,483
it she'll still have me.

976
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:17,551
Please.

977
01:17:19,057 --> 01:17:23,627
Like a sleepy blue ocean

978
01:17:23,628 --> 01:17:26,620
I'll be right back.

979
01:17:31,069 --> 01:17:36,097
Come love me again

980
01:17:47,318 --> 01:17:49,252
What did he say?

981
01:17:54,926 --> 01:17:56,359
He said...

982
01:17:59,898 --> 01:18:01,331
"Marry me."

983
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:09,573
Thank God you were here.

984
01:18:09,574 --> 01:18:11,775
I got so contused.

985
01:18:11,776 --> 01:18:13,209
It happens.

986
01:18:14,379 --> 01:18:15,812
Got a minute?

987
01:18:17,849 --> 01:18:19,282
What's up?

988
01:18:30,995 --> 01:18:34,264
I have to say this quick or I'll
just have this massive coronary...

989
01:18:34,265 --> 01:18:37,401
and then you'll never hear it, and you have to.

990
01:18:37,402 --> 01:18:42,372
This is, by far, the dumbest thing
I've ever done in my entire life.

991
01:18:42,373 --> 01:18:47,778
So dumb, in fact, that I can't.
But I'm gonna.

992
01:18:47,779 --> 01:18:49,303
What's wrong?

993
01:18:57,021 --> 01:19:00,557
I love you.
I've loved you for nine years.

994
01:19:00,558 --> 01:19:04,962
I've just been too arrogant and scared to realize it.

995
01:19:04,963 --> 01:19:07,197
Now I'm just scared.

996
01:19:07,198 --> 01:19:11,068
I realize this comes at a very inopportune time...

997
01:19:11,069 --> 01:19:15,165
but I really have this gigantic favor to ask of you.

998
01:19:17,542 --> 01:19:20,444
Choose me. Marry me.

999
01:19:20,445 --> 01:19:23,437
Let me make you happy.

1000
01:19:24,649 --> 01:19:27,017
That sounds like three favors, doesn't it?

1001
01:19:27,018 --> 01:19:28,451
But--

1002
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,558
- Lovely together.
- Aren't they?

1003
01:20:15,333 --> 01:20:19,235
That's our maid of honor.
She's from New York.

1004
01:20:33,584 --> 01:20:37,988
"Floral Design/Special Events" Michael, wait!

1005
01:20:37,989 --> 01:20:40,082
Please! You'll never catch her!

1006
01:20:43,328 --> 01:20:45,429
Doesn't anybody leave their car unlocked?

1007
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:48,498
Nobody trusts anybody anymore?

1008
01:20:48,499 --> 01:20:50,534
A good Samaritan.

1009
01:20:50,535 --> 01:20:53,136
"AUTO MEMORY STORING"
There's just

1010
01:20:53,137 --> 01:20:55,205
Too little of

What the world needs now "Bakery"

1012

Come back here!

01:20:58,910 --> 01:21:02,679
"Shy tendrils of russet pleasure...

01:21:07,051 --> 01:21:08,552
She moaned.

1016

The tonnage of years of anguish,
sacrifice, mingling with--"

1017
01:21:13,124 --> 01:21:15,559
It is not going well!

1018
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:19,830
This is what comes of telling the truth
or even part of it!

1019
01:21:19,831 --> 01:21:23,066
- Getting what you deserve isn't fair.
- Where are you?

1020
01:21:23,067 --> 01:21:27,738
I have stolen a bread van, and I'm
chasing Michael down Michigan Avenue!

1021
01:21:27,739 --> 01:21:30,173
This is all your fault!
I told him the truth!

1022
01:21:30,174 --> 01:21:32,175
I said that I loved him, and I kissed him.

1023
01:21:32,176 --> 01:21:34,845
- This is what's happened!
- Jules, a question.

1024
01:21:34,846 --> 01:21:38,081
When you kissed Michael, did he kiss you back?

1025
01:21:38,082 --> 01:21:40,083
What do you mean?
We were lip to lip!

1026
01:21:40,084 --> 01:21:44,180
Was there anything there leading you
to believe this chase will end happily?

1027
01:21:45,456 --> 01:21:47,457
That's beside the point.
We were interrupted.

1028
01:21:47,458 --> 01:21:50,193
- Who interrupted you?
- Kimmy! She ruined everything!

1029
01:21:50,194 --> 01:21:52,696
And Michael started chasing her before he could answer me.

1030
01:21:52,697 --> 01:21:54,331
Michael's chasing Kimmy?

1031
01:21:54,332 --> 01:21:56,199
You're chasing Michael?

1032
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:59,269
Who's chasing you?
Nobody. Get it?

1033
01:21:59,270 --> 01:22:00,837
There's your answer: Kimmy.

1034
01:22:00,838 --> 01:22:03,140
Jules, you are not the one!

1035
01:22:03,141 --> 01:22:07,277
Now, for God's sake,
the wedding is at 6:00 p.m.

1036
01:22:07,278 --> 01:22:10,736
You have a small, but distinct, window
of opportunity to do the right thing.

1037
01:22:29,534 --> 01:22:31,468
"EXIT"
"CANAL ST."

1038
01:22:44,148 --> 01:22:45,581
all aboard!

1039
01:22:52,123 --> 01:22:53,556
Excuse me.

1040
01:23:52,483 --> 01:23:54,918
I have a confession to make.

1041
01:23:54,919 --> 01:23:57,285
Another confession.

1042
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:07,295
Besides that I love you, this is even worse.

1043
01:24:14,071 --> 01:24:18,007
The e-mail that Walter sent to your boss--

1044
01:24:22,747 --> 01:24:24,738
I wrote that.

1045
01:24:27,852 --> 01:24:30,616
I'm the bad guy.

1046
01:24:31,622 --> 01:24:33,123
Are you crazy?

1047
01:24:33,124 --> 01:24:36,321
Are you completely insane?

1048
01:24:37,528 --> 01:24:41,123
I mean, Jules, how could you do that?

1049
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:46,636
It wasn't supposed to get sent.

1050
01:24:46,637 --> 01:24:48,935
I just wanted you to get mad at Kimmy.

1051
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:53,743
God.

1052
01:24:56,614 --> 01:25:00,050
I have done nothing but underhanded, despicable...

1053
01:25:00,051 --> 01:25:04,317
not even terribly imaginative things since I got here.

1054
01:25:12,496 --> 01:25:17,365
I was just trying to win you...

1055
01:25:18,703 --> 01:25:21,228
to win you back.

1056
01:25:22,306 --> 01:25:24,706
But that doesn't excuse any of it.

1057
01:25:26,077 --> 01:25:27,567
I'm pond scum.

1058
01:25:30,281 --> 01:25:31,915
Lower, actually.

1059
01:25:31,916 --> 01:25:36,319
I'm like the fungus that feeds on pond scum.

1060
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:37,844
Lower.

1061
01:25:40,591 --> 01:25:43,593
The pus that infects the mucus...

1062
01:25:43,594 --> 01:25:47,530
that cruds up the fungus that feeds on the pond scum.

1063
01:25:55,706 --> 01:25:57,901
On the other hand...

1064
01:26:00,711 --> 01:26:02,144
thank you...

1065
01:26:03,981 --> 01:26:06,176
for loving me that much.

1066
01:26:07,251 --> 01:26:08,952
That way...

1067
01:26:08,953 --> 01:26:10,887
it's pretty flattering.

1068
01:26:12,423 --> 01:26:15,358
Except it makes me fungus.

1069
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:19,926
That part I knew.

1070
01:26:30,241 --> 01:26:31,674
God.

1071
01:26:35,513 --> 01:26:37,947
I'm glad you didn't get on that train.

1072
01:26:40,885 --> 01:26:43,046
I came here looking for her.

1073
01:26:45,523 --> 01:26:49,823
- Why would she be here?
- This is where I proposed.

1074
01:26:52,930 --> 01:26:56,966
I had to cover a game in Milwaukee, and she saw me off.

1075
01:26:56,967 --> 01:27:00,630
The train was starting to leave and...

1076
01:27:02,473 --> 01:27:05,636
I jumped up on the step and I held the handle...

1077
01:27:06,711 --> 01:27:09,479
and without...

1078
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:12,847
a thought in my head,
I just shouted, "Marry me."

1079
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:20,819
The train was pulling out,
and she just suddenly screamed, "Yes!"

1080
01:27:22,993 --> 01:27:24,517
Just once.

1081
01:27:26,263 --> 01:27:28,197
And blew me a kiss.

1082
01:27:40,745 --> 01:27:42,679
It would've been a nice wedding.

1083
01:27:45,116 --> 01:27:48,151
You can't believe that you've lost her.

1084
01:27:48,152 --> 01:27:52,922
You will find her, and you'll look
into her eyes and see all that love.

1085
01:27:52,923 --> 01:27:57,794
I just hope that it's soon.
Or else I'd hate to be you at 6:00.

1086
01:27:57,795 --> 01:27:59,763
Just wait.

1087
01:27:59,764 --> 01:28:01,598
We'll split up.

1088
01:28:01,599 --> 01:28:05,268
You will go to every romantic place the two of you have...

1089
01:28:05,269 --> 01:28:10,673
and I will go someplace brilliant, and we'll find her.

1090
01:28:10,674 --> 01:28:13,165
We will find her.

1091
01:28:16,847 --> 01:28:19,215
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.

1092
01:28:19,216 --> 01:28:21,651
It's Jules.
Have you gotten a call from Kimmy?

1093
01:28:21,652 --> 01:28:24,821
She slipped out, the little monkey, during the commotion.

1094
01:28:24,822 --> 01:28:26,756
"Commotion"?

1095
01:28:26,757 --> 01:28:31,027
My sister was licking an ice sculpture,
and her tongue froze right to it.

1096
01:28:31,028 --> 01:28:33,429
And that's a commotion?

1097
01:28:33,430 --> 01:28:35,431
It's a sculpture of the David.

1098
01:28:35,432 --> 01:28:37,367
So Kimmy would be--

1099
01:28:37,368 --> 01:28:40,737
She's probably with Michael doing the nasty.

1100
01:28:40,738 --> 01:28:43,673
Either that or crying in her nachos down at Comiskey Park.

1101
01:28:43,674 --> 01:28:45,708
- Excuse me?
- I had this crank call...

1102
01:28:45,709 --> 01:28:48,044
from some guy who says he saw her in the luxury box.

1103
01:28:48,045 --> 01:28:51,114
- Right.
- What would a bride be doing--

1104
01:28:51,115 --> 01:28:53,116
Can you bring my dress to the church?

1105
01:28:53,117 --> 01:28:55,852
I have to pick something up for the ceremony.

1106
01:28:55,853 --> 01:28:58,253
Don't forget to shave now.

1107
01:29:00,191 --> 01:29:02,425
Here we go.
Here's the hair dryer.

1108
01:29:02,426 --> 01:29:04,494
There we go.

1109
01:29:04,495 --> 01:29:08,431
It's going to be okay.
Please, no pictures.

1110
01:29:12,269 --> 01:29:13,702
"FEDERAL EXPRESS"

1111
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:29,018
I know you're in here.
The guard saw you come in.

1112
01:29:29,019 --> 01:29:31,783
Just leave me alone, you bitch!

1113
01:29:38,429 --> 01:29:41,331
Who the hell do you think you are?

1114
01:29:41,332 --> 01:29:43,766
- Cat fight!
- You came here...

1115
01:29:43,767 --> 01:29:47,704
pretending to be my friend,
and I made you my maid of honor!

1116
01:29:47,705 --> 01:29:51,374
Who asked you to do that?
You knew me what, eight minutes?

1117
01:29:51,375 --> 01:29:54,043
Michael trusted you, so I trusted you.

1118
01:29:54,044 --> 01:29:57,780
You wanted to keep me close.
You didn't trust me for a second.

1119
01:29:57,781 --> 01:30:00,250
- I was right!
- Of course you were right.

1120
01:30:00,251 --> 01:30:03,353
- But that's not my fault.
- You kissed him!

1121
01:30:03,354 --> 01:30:05,355
- At my parents' house!
- That's cold.

1122
01:30:05,356 --> 01:30:06,956
On my wedding day!

1123
01:30:06,957 --> 01:30:08,758
- Bitch.
- Tramp.

1124
01:30:08,759 --> 01:30:10,760
Shut up!

1125
01:30:10,761 --> 01:30:13,196
Now I love this man, and there is no way...

1126
01:30:13,197 --> 01:30:18,692
I'm going to give him up to some
two-faced, big-haired food critic!

1127
01:30:22,306 --> 01:30:25,041
All right.
Okay, all right!

1128
01:30:25,042 --> 01:30:26,475
I kissed him.

1129
01:30:27,945 --> 01:30:31,346
I tried to steal him.

1130
01:30:35,686 --> 01:30:37,119
I lost.

1131
01:30:42,726 --> 01:30:47,322
He doesn't love me.
He loves you.

1132
01:30:54,371 --> 01:30:57,863
I haven't done much that I'm proud of the last three days.

1133
01:31:01,278 --> 01:31:04,580
I'd like to take you to the church...

1134
01:31:04,581 --> 01:31:07,550
so you can walk down that aisle...

1135
01:31:07,551 --> 01:31:10,042
and marry the man of our dreams.

1136
01:31:11,689 --> 01:31:14,214
Because he sure wants to marry you.

1137
01:33:07,504 --> 01:33:12,375
So raise our glasses and wish Mike
and Kim every happiness...

1138
01:33:12,376 --> 01:33:14,708
for a long and happy life together...

1139
01:33:16,013 --> 01:33:19,141
filled with happiness.

1140
01:33:22,186 --> 01:33:25,519
- I guess that's it.
- To the bride and groom.

1141
01:33:32,296 --> 01:33:35,390
Now let's hear from the maid of honor,
the lovely Julianne.

1142
01:33:45,843 --> 01:33:48,209
I had the strangest dream.

1143
01:33:49,947 --> 01:33:54,646
I dreamt that some psychopath was
trying to break the two of you up.

1144
01:34:00,457 --> 01:34:05,053
Luckily, I woke up and I see...

1145
01:34:06,763 --> 01:34:10,699
that the world is just as it should be...

1146
01:34:14,071 --> 01:34:16,403
for my best friend...

1147
01:34:17,941 --> 01:34:18,735
has won the best woman.

1148
01:34:30,888 --> 01:34:33,152
I didn't get you a gift.

1149
01:34:35,359 --> 01:34:36,626
However, this is on loan...

1150
01:34:36,627 --> 01:34:40,063
However, this is on loan...

1151
01:34:42,699 --> 01:34:45,896
until you two find your song.

1152
01:34:50,107 --> 01:34:53,338
Someday

1153
01:34:55,312 --> 01:34:58,475
When I'm awfully low

1154
01:34:59,683 --> 01:35:02,709
When the world is cold

1155
01:35:04,321 --> 01:35:07,657
I will feel a glow

1156
01:35:07,658 --> 01:35:13,429
Just thinking of you

1157
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:17,389
And the way you look

1158
01:35:18,468 --> 01:35:19,958
Tonight

1159
01:35:21,705 --> 01:35:26,665
Oh, but you're lovely

1160
01:35:28,712 --> 01:35:31,579
With your smile so warm

1161
01:35:33,951 --> 01:35:37,148
And your cheeks so soft

1162
01:35:38,488 --> 01:35:42,291
There is nothing for me

1163
01:35:42,292 --> 01:35:46,626
But to love you

1164
01:35:48,031 --> 01:35:51,262
Just the way you look

1165
01:35:52,236 --> 01:35:54,136
Tonight

1166
01:36:06,917 --> 01:36:09,818
- It's mine!
- I don't think so!

1167
01:36:13,890 --> 01:36:15,482
I got it!

1168
01:36:44,721 --> 01:36:46,245
Bye.

1169
01:37:34,204 --> 01:37:36,605
Hey, gorgeous, having a good time?

1170
01:37:36,606 --> 01:37:39,909
Not particularly, but I did what I came to do.

1171
01:37:39,910 --> 01:37:42,111
What? You split them up?

1172
01:37:42,112 --> 01:37:43,979
No, I said good-bye.

1173
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:46,649
Good girl.
I'm proud of you.

1174
01:37:46,650 --> 01:37:49,018
Be prouder still if you were dancing.

1175
01:37:49,019 --> 01:37:51,253
I have big plans for dancing.

1176
01:37:51,254 --> 01:37:55,224
Just give me 30, 35 years.

1177
01:37:55,225 --> 01:37:57,026
The misery...

1178
01:37:57,027 --> 01:37:58,561
the exquisite tragedy.

1179
01:37:58,562 --> 01:38:01,530
The Susan Hayward of it all.

1180
01:38:01,531 --> 01:38:05,134
I can picture you there sitting alone
at your table in your lavender gown.

1181
01:38:05,135 --> 01:38:06,702
Did I tell you my gown was lavender?

1182
01:38:06,703 --> 01:38:09,839
Hair swept up.
Haven't touched your cake.

1183
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:14,210
Probably drumming your fingernails
on the white linen tablecloth...

1184
01:38:14,211 --> 01:38:16,379
the way you do when you're really feeling down.

1185
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:19,882
Perhaps looking at those nails thinking:
"I should've stopped...

1186
01:38:19,883 --> 01:38:23,501
my evil plotting to have that manicure,
but it's too late now."

1187
01:38:23,502 --> 01:38:27,223
I didn't tell you my dress was lavender.

1188
01:38:27,224 --> 01:38:29,291
Suddenly, a familiar song.

1189
01:38:29,292 --> 01:38:32,659
The moment I wake up

1190
01:38:34,364 --> 01:38:37,390
And you're off your chair in one, exquisite movement...

1191
01:38:40,103 --> 01:38:43,339
wondering, searching, sniffing the wind...

1192
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:45,841
like a dapple deer.

1193
01:38:45,842 --> 01:38:47,977
Has God heard your little prayer?

1194
01:38:47,978 --> 01:38:50,613
Will Cinderella dance again?

1195
01:38:50,614 --> 01:38:54,812
And then, suddenly, the crowds part...

1196
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:57,953
and there he is:

1197
01:38:59,289 --> 01:39:02,391
sleek, stylish...

1198
01:39:02,392 --> 01:39:05,161
radiant with charisma.

1199
01:39:05,162 --> 01:39:08,297
Bizarrely, he's on the telephone.

1200
01:39:08,298 --> 01:39:10,858
But then, so are you.

1201
01:39:13,336 --> 01:39:15,361
And he comes towards you...

1202
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:18,574
the moves of a jungle cat.

1203
01:39:19,810 --> 01:39:22,210
Although you quite correctly sense that he is...

1204
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:25,214
...

1205
01:39:25,215 --> 01:39:28,742
like most devastatingly handsome
single men of his age are...

1206
01:39:30,487 --> 01:39:33,513
you think, what the hell...

1207
01:39:35,358 --> 01:39:37,827
life goes on.

1208
01:39:37,828 --> 01:39:40,523
Maybe there won't be marriage.

1209
01:39:40,524 --> 01:39:42,725
Maybe there won't be sex.

1210
01:39:44,067 --> 01:39:47,901
But, by God, there'll be dancing.

1211
01:40:06,456 --> 01:40:08,788
Bond. Jane Bond.

1212
01:40:09,305 --> 01:41:09,325
