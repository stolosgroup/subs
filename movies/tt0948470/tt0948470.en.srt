2
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,479
Five, four, three...

3
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:06,274
...two, one.

4
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:07,900
Ready or not, here I come.

5
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,602
Hey, Dad?

6
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,814
Dad!

7
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,169
You'll stay with Aunt May...

8
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,130
...and Uncle Ben for a little while.

9
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,465
- I wanna go with you.
- No.

10
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,972
Doesn't like crust
on his sandwiches...

11
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,391
...and he likes to sleep
with a little light on.

12
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,685
- Mary. Come on, come on.
- Oh, God.

13
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,399
Dad.

14
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,943
Be good.

15
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,545
Sorry.

16
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,547
Morning, Flash.

17
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,594
Good morning, Parker.

18
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,936
Hey. It's Peter, right?

19
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,189
I really like your photos.

20
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,982
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

21
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,108
Listen...

22
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,610
...are you busy Friday night?

23
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:46,118
Cool. Can you take pictures
of my boyfriend's car?

24
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,287
You know, I really wanna frame
a good one...

25
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,538
...for his birthday.

26
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,792
That's really nice of you.
Wow, that's such a nice thought.

27
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,294
Yeah, I'll have a look at the old...

28
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,213
- The old schedule.
- Okay.

29
00:04:58,382 --> 00:04:59,507
Parker.

30
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,717
- Yes, sir?
- You want to keep that skateboard?

31
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,386
- Yeah.
- Keep it off the ground.

32
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,887
- Sure. Yeah.
- Wheels up.

33
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,180
Like that?

34
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,057
- That's it.
- Okay.

35
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,584
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

36
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,128
Eat it! Eat it!

37
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,839
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

38
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,425
Eat your vegetables, Gordon.
Come on!

39
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,051
Come on!

40
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,386
Hey, Parker, come on.

41
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:46,929
Get a picture of this.

42
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,266
No, I'm not gonna take a picture of it.
Put him down, man.

43
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,393
- Come on.
- Gordon, don't eat it.

44
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:53,602
Take the picture.

45
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,229
Put him down, Flash.

46
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,981
Take the picture.

47
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,734
Put him down, Eugene!

48
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,113
Hey, man.

49
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:06,615
Come on!

50
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,450
Get up, Parker!

51
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:10,870
Get up!

52
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,663
Come on! Come on!

53
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:13,497
Get up!

54
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,793
Still not taking the picture.

55
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,628
Stay down, Parker!

56
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,630
Who wants one more?

57
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,382
- One more!
- Flash!

58
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,259
Flash...

59
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,303
...we still on for after school today?

60
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:28,596
My house, 3:30?

61
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:29,972
I hope you did homework.

62
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,640
Last time, I was...

63
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,434
...disappointed in you.

64
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,686
- Okay, move.
- No, how about we go to class?

65
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,063
How about it?

66
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,442
Whatever.

67
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,427
I thought that was great
what you did.

68
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,429
It was stupid...

69
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,181
...but it was great.

70
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,058
You should go to...

71
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,976
...the nurse.
You might have a concussion.

72
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,021
What's your name?

73
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,689
You don't know my name?

74
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,858
No, I know your name.

75
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,735
I want to know
if you know your name.

76
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,030
Peter.

77
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,283
- Parker. Peter Parker.
- Okay. Okay, good.

78
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,543
I'd still go to the nurse though.

79
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,961
You're Gwen, right?

80
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,337
Gwen Stacy.

81
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,339
All right.

82
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,259
Hey.

83
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,343
I'm making...

84
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,220
...spaghetti and meatballs tonight.

85
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,056
You're serious?
Spaghetti and meatballs.

86
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,935
Since when don't you like
spaghetti and meatballs, huh?

87
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,146
- Oh, my God.
- What's up?

88
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,856
What happened to your face?

89
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,400
I'm all right. Just... I fell, skating.

90
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,152
It's all right.

91
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,863
Ben Parker, don't you even...

92
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,991
...think about leaving
that filthy box in my kitchen.

93
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,200
My bowling trophies.

94
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,910
Oh, well, then, by all means...

95
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,579
...leave that box in my kitchen.

96
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,205
- What happened to you?
- He fell.

97
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,373
Why you kids...

98
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,167
...ride those things, I'll never know.

99
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,918
Because it's stupid and dangerous.

100
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,712
Remember when we were stupid?

101
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
No.

102
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,174
- Trust me, we were.
- All right. Good to know.

103
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,258
Where's the flood?

104
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,926
Follow me. I'll show you.

105
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,303
- You serious?
- Yes.

106
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,096
All right.

107
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:36,932
It's the condenser tray.

108
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,686
Too much water for the condenser tray
or the heat exchange tubing.

109
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,771
This has got to be the fill line.

110
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,316
That's the only thing
that makes any sense.

111
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,817
Can you fix it?

112
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,237
No, not tonight.
I'll go by the hardware store tomorrow.

113
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,823
Good deal. And meanwhile,
put this on your face.

114
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,535
How's the other guy look?

115
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,248
Come on.
I know a right cross when I see one.

116
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,211
Yes or no?
Do I have to call somebody's father?

117
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:06,670
No, no.

118
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:07,922
All right.

119
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,174
Well, I wouldn't tell your Aunt May.

120
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,636
I pity the poor kid
who'd have to suffer her wrath.

121
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,889
Before you come up, see if...

122
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,475
...there's anything else worth saving.
- Okay.

123
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,619
- Plumbers don't fix appliances.
- Yes, they do.

124
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,371
They fix pipes and pump things.

125
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,373
If you ask them to...

126
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,338
I forgot all about that thing.

127
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,381
It was your dad's.

128
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,383
- Yeah.
- He asked us to keep it safe.

129
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,807
He saw it in the window of that
leather shop over on 9th Avenue.

130
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,644
He was 19. What does a 19-year-old kid
need with a briefcase?

131
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,604
And guess who sold it to him.

132
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,439
- I don't know.
- Your mother.

133
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,691
That's how they met.

134
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,651
He asked you to...

135
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,778
...keep this safe?
There's nothing in here.

136
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,697
Have you looked?
There's nothing here.

137
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,991
Your father was
a very secretive man, Peter.

138
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,660
Yeah, I know.

139
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:26,667
Who's that?

140
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,377
Do you know who that is?

141
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,878
Some guy who worked with...

142
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,171
...your dad, I guess.

143
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,970
Just take this off the table, all right?

144
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,181
We're gonna eat. Off.
And wash your hands.

145
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,225
- Now.
- All right.

146
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,393
Go on.

147
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,638
I need you to be a good boy.

148
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,931
Where are you going?

149
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,266
There's something...

150
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,435
...your mom and I have to do.

151
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,827
What is this?

152
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,957
"Zero, zero, decay rate algorithm."

153
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,378
Yeah, one sec, one sec.

154
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,179
Come in.

155
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:45,681
You okay?

156
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:48,183
- Yeah. What's up?
- Oh, my God.

157
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,643
You look just like him.

158
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,604
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

159
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,944
Listen...

160
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,571
...I don't have much education.

161
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,197
You know that, Peter.

162
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:06,034
Hell, I stopped being able to help
with your homework when you were 10.

163
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,787
What I'm trying to say is...

164
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,707
...I know it's been rough
for you without your dad.

165
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,042
And I know we don't talk
much about them.

166
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,128
- Yeah, it's all right.
- No, it is not...

167
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,671
...all right.

168
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,341
I wish I could change it, but I can't.

169
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,595
Curt Connors.

170
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,015
That's the name of the guy
in the picture with your dad.

171
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,517
They worked together for years
and they were close.

172
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,061
But after that night,
we never saw him again.

173
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,189
He never even called.

174
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,565
Not once.

175
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,694
Go figure.

176
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,282
She's pretty.

177
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:51,747
Uncle Ben.

178
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,165
What?

179
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,250
You're a pretty great dad.

180
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,599
Excuse me.

181
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:53,559
What?

182
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,310
Can I help you?

183
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,145
I don't know. I'm here to see...

184
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,772
...Dr. Connors.
- Right.

185
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,816
You'll find yourself to the left.

186
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,403
You are here for the internship?

187
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,655
Yeah. Yeah.

188
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:07,906
Okay.

189
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,950
You'll find your badge to the left.

190
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,832
Having trouble finding yourself?

191
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:18,500
No. Yeah, I got it.

192
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,837
Okay...

193
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,880
...Mr. Guevara.

194
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,136
Welcome to Oscorp.

195
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:32,139
Born from the mind of our founder,
Norman Osborn...

196
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:35,976
...the Oscorp Tower houses
108 floors of innovation.

197
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:41,148
Our scientific minds are pushing
the boundaries of defence, biomedical...

198
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,109
...and chemical technologies.
The future lies within.

199
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,569
Welcome to Oscorp.

200
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,029
I'm Gwen Stacy, a senior...

201
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,071
...at Midtown Science...

202
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,656
...and head intern to Dr. Connors.

203
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,992
I'll be with you
for the duration of your visit.

204
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,827
Where I go, you go.

205
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,704
That's the rule. Remember that...

206
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,331
...all will be fine.
- Come on!

207
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,874
- If you forget that...
- Listen!

208
00:15:59,042 --> 00:15:59,958
Look, listen.

209
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,710
Tell them Rodrigo Guevara is here.

210
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:02,961
Just tell them...

211
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,171
...Rodrigo Guevara is here!

212
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,505
My name's Rodrigo!

213
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,508
I guess I don't need to tell you
what happens if you forget.

214
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,052
Shall we?

215
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,686
Come around this way.

216
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,067
Good afternoon, Gwen.

217
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,193
Dr. Connors.

218
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,111
Welcome.

219
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,073
My name is Dr. Curtis Connors.

220
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,492
Yes, in case you're wondering,
I'm a southpaw.

221
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,910
I'm not a cripple...

222
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:38,413
...I'm a scientist, and the world's
foremost authority on herpetology.

223
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,333
That's reptiles,
for those of you who don't know.

224
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,959
Like the Parkinson's patient...

225
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,837
...who watches on in horror
as her body...

226
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,424
...slowly betrays her, or the man
with macular degeneration...

227
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:53,428
...whose eyes grow dimmer each day,
I long to fix myself.

228
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:57,432
I want to create a world
without weakness.

229
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,560
Anyone care to venture a guess
just how?

230
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:01,937
Yes.

231
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,063
Stem cells?

232
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,815
Promising. But the solution...

233
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,776
...I'm thinking of is more radical.

234
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,613
- No one?
- Cross-species genetics.

235
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,081
Person gets Parkinson's...

236
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,625
...when the brain cells
that produce dopamine...

237
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,794
...start to disappear.

238
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,629
But a zebra fish has the ability...

239
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,006
...to regenerate cells on command.

240
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,092
If you could give this ability...

241
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,137
...to the woman you're talking about,
that's that. She's...

242
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,514
She's curing herself.

243
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,559
Yeah, you just have to look past
the gills on her neck.

244
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,313
And you are?

245
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,359
He's one of Midtown Science's...

246
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,027
...best and brightest.
- Really?

247
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,195
Second in his class.

248
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,157
- Second?
- Yeah.

249
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,158
Sure about that?

250
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,784
I'm pretty sure.

251
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:05,167
I'm afraid duty calls. I'll leave you in the
more-than-capable hands of Miss Stacy.

252
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,210
Nice meeting you all.

253
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,840
If you'd like to gather round.

254
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,009
Welcome to Oscorp's tree of life.

255
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,596
Our planet's tree of life is immense.

256
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,306
At Oscorp's...

257
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,183
...Cross-Species Division...
- Hi.

258
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,352
...we endeavour to explore
exciting new methods...

259
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:26,980
What are you doing, "Rodrigo"?

260
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,276
Oh, yeah.

261
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,694
What are you doing here?

262
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,029
I work here. I don't.

263
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:35,781
I was gonna say I work here...

264
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,159
...but it seems like you do work here.
So you know that I don't.

265
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,202
You following me?

266
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,497
No, I'm not following you, no.
I had no idea you worked here.

267
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,873
Why would you be here?

268
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,875
I just snuck in because...

269
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,460
I love science.

270
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,420
- You love it.
- I'm passionate about it.

271
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,214
So you snuck in...?

272
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,549
- I have to lead this tour group.
- I know.

273
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,636
I'll ask you more about this later.
Do not get me in trouble.

274
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,055
- I promise you I won't.
- Stay with the group.

275
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:04,184
All right, guys? I'm gonna take you
to the bioreactor room now.

276
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,481
Sorry. Yo.

277
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,983
Sorry.

278
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:39,005
We received the results from
the mRNA sequences this morning.

279
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,967
They were disappointing.

280
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,890
Define "disappointing."

281
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,392
Another dead end.

282
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,227
It's the decay rate algorithm.

283
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,896
- And this is to be expected.
- Expected?

284
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,398
You said you were close.

285
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,733
We are close,
but it's gonna take time.

286
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,110
He doesn't have time.

287
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,570
Norman Osborn is dying,
Dr. Connors.

288
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,322
Save him.

289
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:08,535
Or we'll both lose our heads.

290
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,388
All right, give me the badge.

291
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,933
Give it to me.

292
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,980
Sorry.

293
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,251
Disgusting. Now I smell like beer.

294
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,004
I didn't mean to do that.

295
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,589
I didn't mean to...

296
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,508
I didn't... I didn't...

297
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,010
Get your hand off her!

298
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,845
I'm trying to get my...

299
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:55,433
Are you kidding?

300
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:56,392
I'm sorry.

301
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,769
Are you kidding me?

302
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,063
- Hey, get him, Rudy!
- Hey!

303
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,526
Man, I'm sorry!

304
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,777
Man, are you all right?

305
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,240
- Take him down!
- Come on.

306
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,452
Get him, man! Get him!

307
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:18,498
No, man, no. Not my board.

308
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:19,958
Please, dude, don't...

309
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:22,961
Sorry!

310
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,924
Sorry. Sorry.

311
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,384
I'm so sorry.

312
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,890
Coney Island, next stop.

313
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,017
Next and final stop, Coney Island.

314
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,697
Hey.

315
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,199
Hey. Hey.

316
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,576
Sorry. I'm late.

317
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,411
- I got...
- We've been so worried.

318
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:57,704
I know. I'm sorry.

319
00:24:57,872 --> 00:24:59,205
Watch out!

320
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,463
That's a fly, Peter.

321
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:13,178
Yeah.

322
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,642
I'm so sorry...

323
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:20,977
...I kept you guys up.

324
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:24,480
I'm insensitive, I'm irresponsible...

325
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,441
...and I'm hungry.

326
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:32,530
Meat loaf.

327
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,284
Drinking?

328
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:37,493
What's this?

329
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,037
I don't think so.

330
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:40,872
This is your meat loaf.

331
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,126
This beats all other meat loafs.

332
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,421
Something is very wrong.

333
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:50,089
Yeah.

334
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,300
Nobody likes your meat loaf.

335
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,974
I got it.

336
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,813
He took the frozen
macaroni and cheese.

337
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,815
I noticed that.

338
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,611
Why didn't you tell me
you didn't like my meat loaf?

339
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:14,072
You could have said that to me
37 years ago.

340
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,908
How many meat loafs
have I made for you?

341
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,830
Peter.

342
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,332
What are you doing?

343
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm...

344
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:15,086
Homework.

345
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,796
Be careful.

346
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,548
Sure.

347
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,183
Dr. Connors.

348
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:32,687
You don't remember me. I...

349
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:34,105
The intern from the other day.

350
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,357
Yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah.

351
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,818
I'm sure you're very nice,
but this is a home.

352
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,320
I ask you to make an appointment
with my office.

353
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,864
I'm Richard Parker's son.

354
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,330
Peter?

355
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:54,625
I'm afraid...

356
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,087
...I can't help you much. I don't
know why they left or where they...

357
00:29:58,255 --> 00:29:59,005
...were going.

358
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,259
Good reflexes.

359
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,802
Thank you.

360
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,893
- Thank you.
- I read your book.

361
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,519
Yeah.

362
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:14,854
It's something, you know.

363
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,814
So you really think...

364
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,692
...it's possible, cross-species genetics?
- Yes, of course.

365
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,320
Your father and I
were mocked for our theories.

366
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:25,239
Not just in the community at large,
but at Oscorp, as well.

367
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,533
They called us mad scientists.

368
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:31,037
And then your father
bred the spiders...

369
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:32,580
...and everything changed.

370
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,415
The results were
beyond encouraging.

371
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,542
They were spectacular.

372
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,672
We were gonna change
the lives of millions.

373
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,799
Including my own.

374
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,885
Then it was over.

375
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,680
He was gone.

376
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,350
Took his research with him.

377
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:56,020
And I knew without him, I...

378
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,196
I...

379
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,950
I was angry.

380
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,204
So I stayed away from you...

381
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,289
...and your family.

382
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,375
And for that, I'm truly sorry.

383
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,385
Say...

384
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,136
Say it worked.

385
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,472
Say you got it to work.

386
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:35,935
Like, how much would
the foreign species take over?

387
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,980
What could the side effects be?

388
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,778
It's hard to say,
considering no subject survived.

389
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,572
The problem was always...

390
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,156
The decay rate algorithm?

391
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,619
- Right.
- Right.

392
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,163
Can I?

393
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,999
Of course.

394
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:21,856
Extraordinary.

395
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,317
How did you come up with this?

396
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,618
Peter, how about coming
to see me at the Tower...

397
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,703
...one day after school?
- Yeah.

398
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,665
Thank you.

399
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,312
Number one, Reggie.

400
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,396
Run it, buddy.

401
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,106
Let's go, Reggie.

402
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,277
Rejected!

403
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,657
You did that on purpose, Flash!

404
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,909
I should've.
You better watch your back.

405
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,539
Hey.

406
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,376
All right?

407
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:30,925
Give it up.

408
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,515
Come on, man.

409
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,434
One sec.

410
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:46,232
- Come on, man.
- Why don't you take it from me?

411
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,654
That's right. Take it.

412
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,447
Go ahead. Take it.

413
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:15,261
Just take it.

414
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,807
All right, how about this?

415
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:21,642
All right?

416
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,727
How about that?

417
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,108
- Come on, Flash.
- Flash, stop playing, man.

418
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:31,402
- Take it from him!
- Come on, Flash. Take it.

419
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,903
Yo, Flash, let's go.

420
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,572
- Let's go!
- Do it, Flash.

421
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,490
- Stop playing, man.
- Let's go, Flash.

422
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,325
- What are you doing?
- What's up?

423
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:40,870
What you doing?

424
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:46,000
All right, bring it!
Come on, Parker! Come on!

425
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,182
Peter's behaviour is just...

426
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,141
...unacceptable.

427
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:03,184
They won't make us pay...

428
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,187
...for the backboard.
- I don't care about the backboard.

429
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,063
- Was that true?
- What?

430
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,024
What I heard in there just now.

431
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:13,152
Did you humiliate that boy?

432
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,196
Yeah, I did.

433
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,364
- But...
- But what?

434
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,991
- This guy deserved it.
- Did he?

435
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,868
- Yeah.
- Is he the kid that hit you?

436
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:24,455
Is he?

437
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,457
Yeah, yeah, but...

438
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,709
So all this is about getting even.

439
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:32,713
If so, I guess you must feel pretty good
about yourself now, right?

440
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:33,881
Am I right or wrong?

441
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,468
Yeah, I thought so.

442
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,429
Well, thanks to this
little escapade of yours...

443
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,556
...I had to change shifts at work...

444
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:46,393
...so you have to pick up Aunt May
tonight at 9:00. Understood?

445
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:48,354
- Is that understood?
- Yeah.

446
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:50,231
Okay, good.

447
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,692
She looks familiar.

448
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:57,696
The girl on your computer.

449
00:35:58,365 --> 00:35:59,532
Yeah.

450
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,660
He's got you on his computer.
I'm his probation officer.

451
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,079
Don't forget Aunt May.

452
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,584
Okay.

453
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:16,173
He's a character.

454
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,341
That's my uncle.

455
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,552
He's a pathological liar.

456
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,095
He thought you were someone else.

457
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:23,764
Oh, man, you don't have me
on your computer?

458
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:27,059
I took a photo of the debate team,
and you're in the debate team.

459
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:28,936
- Right.
- So...

460
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,438
...he must have seen...
I was touching up stuff.

461
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:33,774
- Touching up stuff?
- Come on.

462
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,610
I was... I'm not gonna answer that.

463
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,198
- Did you get expelled?
- No, no.

464
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,576
I didn't get expelled.
I got community service.

465
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,832
So you want to... I don't know?

466
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,126
Want to what?

467
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,003
I don't know.

468
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,880
Just...

469
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,596
I don't know... We could...

470
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,557
We could do something else,
or we could...

471
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,184
- If you don't feel like, we could...
- Yeah.

472
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,895
- Yeah?
- Yeah, either one.

473
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:14,440
- Really?
- Sure.

474
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:16,150
Okay.

475
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:17,651
All right, good. Sounds good.

476
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:18,777
Cool.

477
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,821
Okay.

478
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:23,324
- I can't right now, I can't right now.
- Yeah, no.

479
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,659
- I'm so busy right now.
- I know, me too.

480
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,831
But maybe...

481
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,167
- Yeah, just, you know...
- Some other...

482
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:35,002
- Time, all right.
- Okay.

483
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,837
- Bye.
- All right.

484
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:07,469
We have protein structure, rDNA...

485
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,722
...chromatography,
transgenics testing...

486
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:13,142
...that's X-ray video. That's the only
one on the planet. We have...

487
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,103
- Human line testing over...
- I remember that.

488
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,938
I've seen that before.

489
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:19,398
The Ganali device.

490
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:22,276
Yeah, I remember a picture of that
in my dad's office.

491
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:24,945
The idea was so simple.
You load it with an antigen.

492
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:27,614
It creates a cloud which can be
dispersed over a neighbourhood...

493
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:28,574
...even a city.

494
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:32,119
Theoretically, you could
cure polio in an afternoon.

495
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:34,288
That's incredible.

496
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:37,708
Well, others disagreed. What if
the device were loaded with a toxin?

497
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,877
What if you wanted to opt out?
You can't...

498
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:43,464
...run away from a cloud after all,
so here it lies, gathering dust.

499
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,925
What you see here
is a computer model of a lizard.

500
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:50,304
Many of these wonderful creatures
have so brilliantly adapted...

501
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:52,973
...that they can regenerate
entire limbs at will.

502
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,975
You can imagine my envy.

503
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,061
We're trying to harness
this capability...

504
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,480
...and transfer it
into our host subject:

505
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,899
Freddy the three-legged mouse.

506
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,110
Enter the algorithm now.

507
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,281
Need to take that?

508
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,080
System ready...

509
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,831
...for gene insertion.

510
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,625
Okay.

511
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,543
Check.

512
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,630
See what I'm trying to do?

513
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,673
- Preempt the proteins.
- The immune response.

514
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,008
Beginning trials.

515
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,761

516
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,471

517
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,598

518
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:35,641

Subject deceased. Pending.

521
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,898
Peptide algorithm accepted.

522
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:44,233
Regrowth complete.

523
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,901
- Hey.
- Vitals normal.

524
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:48,654
Blood pressure normal.

525
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,698
Limb regeneration successful.

526
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,659
Extraordinary.

527
00:40:57,831 --> 00:40:59,706
And thank you.

528
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,583
Meet Fred and Wilma...

529
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,043
...our three-legged...

530
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,336
...mice.

531
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,465
Here you go.

532
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,969
Hey, buddy, I got you.

533
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,596
Okay.

534
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,849
Careful, don't want to stick you
by mistake.

535
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,892
Human trials aren't until next week.

536
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:22,688
There.

537
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,822
Hey.

538
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:34,366
Hey, I thought you...

539
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,451
Didn't you forget something?

540
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,370
What?

541
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:42,374
Now, don't answer that,
but I'm glad to know it's working.

542
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:47,337
You owe your aunt
an apology bigtime.

543
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:50,340
Be a man.

544
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,217
Get in there and apologise.

545
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:57,181
I'm sorry, Aunt May, I...

546
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,640
Honestly, you don't have...

547
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,392
...to apologise to me. It's your...

548
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,352
- The hell he doesn't.
- Ben.

549
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,105
Look, I'm sorry, I got distracted.

550
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,191
- Oh, he got distracted.
- Yeah.

551
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,485
Your aunt, my wife,
had to walk 12 blocks alone...

552
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:14,114
...in the middle of the night and then
wait in a deserted subway station...

553
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,532
...because you got distracted.

554
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,367
Ben, sweetheart, honestly...

555
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,578
...I am completely capable
of walking home...

556
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:21,788
You will not defend this boy!

557
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,248
- I'm not defending...
- You are!

558
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,918
- Listen to me, son.
- Yeah, go ahead.

559
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,628
You're a lot like your father.

560
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,297
You really are, Peter,
and that's a good thing...

561
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:33,592
...but your father lived by a philosophy,
a principle, really.

562
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,095
He believed that if you could do
good things for other people...

563
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,723
...you had a moral obligation
to do those things.

564
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,475
That's what's at stake here.

565
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:42,643
Not choice.

566
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,811
Responsibility.

567
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,483
That is nice. That's great.

568
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,611
That's all well and good.
So where is he?

569
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,697
- What?
- Where is he?

570
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,824
Where's my dad?

571
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:01,495
He didn't think it was his responsibility
to be here to tell me himself?

572
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:02,996
Oh, come on, how dare you?

573
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:04,873
How dare I? How dare you?

574
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:10,504
Where you going?

575
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:12,464
Peter, come back here, please.

576
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:25,143
Ben, leave him alone for a little while.
He'll be all right.

577
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,157
Peter!

578
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,370
Peter?

579
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,377
Peter!

580
00:43:55,466 --> 00:44:00,929
It's $2.07.

581
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:02,431
Yeah. No, I know.

582
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,434
Yeah, you're holding up the line. No.

583
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,894
You can leave a penny,
you can't take a penny.

584
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,272
- What?
- You can leave...

585
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,066
...a penny anytime,
you have to spend 10 dollars...

586
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,152
...to take a penny.
It's store policy.

587
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,738
- You're holding up my line.
- I don't have 2 cents.

588
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,573
You can't afford milk, step aside.

589
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:21,992
Daddy didn't give you
enough milk money today?

590
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,493
We're talking about 2 cents.

591
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,703
Just step aside, kid.

592
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:32,627
Really?

593
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:47,392
Yo, not cool, bro.

594
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,271
Hey, man, stop!

595
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:52,898
Somebody stop that guy!

596
00:44:53,066 --> 00:44:54,441
Hey, kid, little help?

597
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:55,984
Not my policy.

598
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,611
Somebody stop that dude!

599
00:44:58,613 --> 00:44:59,279
Hey!

600
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:00,739
Hey, stop!

601
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,533
Somebody stop that dude!

602
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,085
Hey!

603
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:45,492
Oh, God, oh, God.

604
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,202
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

605
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:49,454
Call an ambulance!

606
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:52,040
Someone call an ambulance!
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

607
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,334
Oh, God, oh, my God.

608
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,714
Oh, God.

609
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,469
No.

610
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,598
Oh, Jesus.

611
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,481
Witnesses gave a description to the
sketch artist. I need you to take a look.

612
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:22,696
No, I don't know him.

613
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:26,408
I didn't expect you would, ma'am.
Homicide detectives...

614
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:28,535
...are on it.
We'll see what they turn up.

615
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:30,370
Okay.

616
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,335
Can I have that?

617
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,879
Sure.

618
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,175
There's one other thing.
He has a star...

619
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,092
...tattooed...

620
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,510
...on his left hand.

621
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:17,501
Peter, I know things
have been difficult lately...

622
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,794
...and I'm sorry about that.

623
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:22,589
I think I know what you're feeling.

624
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:40,398
Hey, Parker.

625
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,527
- Not today.
- Come on, I just want to talk.

626
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,617
It feels better, right?

627
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,119
Look, your uncle died.

628
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:55,247
I'm sorry.

629
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,873
I get it.

630
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,833
I'm sorry.

631
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,794
Okay?

632
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:08,343
Peter.

633
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,013
Stay away from him.

634
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,180
- You understand?
- Hey!

635
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,765
- Stay away from Joey.
- Hey!

636
00:48:58,019 --> 00:48:59,311
You like beating on girls?

637
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,021
You like beating on old men?

638
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:01,855
Hey, pal...

639
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:02,814
...keep walking.

640
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:05,400
- You're in the wrong place.
- When were you in Queens?

641
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:07,235
I asked you a question.

642
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:08,320
Nicky, no!

643
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,195
That the gun?

644
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,447
You gonna kill me too?

645
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,575
Hey! Stop it!

646
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,410
Hey, get off!

647
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:17,829
Wait, oh, don't hit Nicky!

648
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:19,205
Back up!

649
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,000
This guy is crazy!

650
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,877
Get him!

651
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,634
Get back here, man! Get him!

652
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,224
Follow him!

653
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,605
- Go around, man!
- I'll follow you!

654
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:53,740
Go, go, go!

655
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:56,284
There he is!

656
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:57,285
Can't get away!

657
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:15,762
He has a star tattooed
on his left hand.

658
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,525
Oh, yeah?

659
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:29,693
Come on!

660
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:38,660
I know what you look like!

661
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:40,620
You hear me?

662
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,415
I've seen your face!

663
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:22,829
Is that all you got?

664
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:25,999
Just take it, take it.

665
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,174
Engineered from
genetically enhanced spiders...

666
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:38,762
...Oscorp's BioCable tensile strength
is unparalleled. We're just beginning...

667
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:42,682
...to understand all the potential
industrial applications.

668
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:46,352
A single pellet can safely store
several hundred metres...

669
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,354
...of the lightweight cable.

670
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:58,114
Mother...

671
00:52:55,631 --> 00:53:00,301
Attention, all units in the confines
of Precinct 13, receiving a 10-30...

672
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:02,762
...on West 19th Street
and Broadway.

673
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,682
Assailant is Caucasian male,
mid-30s...

674
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:08,768
...170 to 180 pounds...

675
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:10,311
...shoulder-length blond hair.

676
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:13,106
Last seen on foot
heading eastbound on 19th Street.

677
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,001
Hey.

678
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,802
You got a description?

679
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,178
Well, no, he wears a mask.

680
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:45,972
A mask?

681
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,307
Most of his victims...

682
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:50,852
...are suspects with serious rap sheets.
They're calling him a vigilante.

683
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,396
Okay, he's not a vigilante,
he's an anarchist.

684
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,190
Help me, somebody! Arrest me!

685
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,483
Get me out of here.

686
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:00,236
Hey, look!

687
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,333
Spandex. Spandex.

688
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,126
Everything...

689
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:16,169
...spandex.

690
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,671
Extraordinary velocity vector
is a function...

691
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:20,673
...of both mass and acceleration.

692
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:22,634
Come on,
you know better than anyone...

693
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,261
...the weight on any pendulum
has no effect on speed.

694
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:29,182
It doesn't affect frequency,
but it's totally a factor in momentum.

695
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,011
Hey, Aunt May.

696
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,514
Yeah. Eggs?

697
00:55:09,682 --> 00:55:10,848
Organic, got it.

698
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,675
In the future,
if you're gonna steal cars...

699
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:47,802
...don't dress like a car thief, man.

700
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,512
What are you? You a cop?

701
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:54,600
Really? You seriously think I'm a cop?
Cop in a skin-tight red-and-blue suit?

702
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,269
You know, you're...

703
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:58,438
You've got a mind...

704
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,064
...of the true scholar, sir.

705
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:02,608
I was going more for the guys
who do the luge.

706
00:56:03,152 --> 00:56:04,277
Good thinking.

707
00:56:04,445 --> 00:56:05,987
Get out the window.

708
00:56:06,155 --> 00:56:07,447
There you go. You got it.

709
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:17,290
Crotch!

710
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:22,462
- Just let me go.
- Is that a real knife?

711
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,796
Yes, it's a real knife.

712
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,465
My weakness, it's small knives.

713
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,216
- Just let me go.
- Anything but...

714
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,302
...knives! Oh, it's so simple.

715
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:30,928
- That was cool.
- What is this?

716
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:33,681
Webbing I developed.
I don't think you want to know.

717
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:34,515
Let me go!

718
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:38,144
Okay, one second.
Hold on, one second.

719
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:39,437
Knock it off, man. No!

720
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:42,982
Come on, let me go. Stop it!

721
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:44,859
That isn't funny.

722
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:46,486
- It is kind of funny.
- Help!

723
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:58,831
This could've gone a lot worse.

724
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,958
Now hold still.

725
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:07,840
Boys in blue here.

726
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:10,510
- Yo, I got him.
- Freeze!

727
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,512
- He's not going anywhere.
- Don't move.

728
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:13,679
You serious?

729
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,014
Who are you?

730
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,141
No one grasps
the concept of the mask.

731
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:18,101
Freeze!

732
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:22,688
I just did 80 percent of your job.

733
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:23,981
And that?

734
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,066
That's how you repay me?

735
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:29,862
Hold it right there!

736
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:51,926
Well, that was fun.

737
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:55,012
Bus! Hey there, everybody.

738
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:00,101
What are you doing?

739
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:05,773
Hey, watch out.

740
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:08,734
I'm swinging here.

741
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:26,627
So 38 of New York's finest...

742
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:29,964
...versus one guy in a unitard.

743
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,091
Am I correct?

744
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:47,648
You don't have to wait up for me.

745
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:49,108
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

746
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:50,276
Yes, I do.

747
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:51,777
- Okay.
- Where were you?

748
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:52,987
I was out.

749
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:55,114
Did you get the eggs?

750
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:58,159
Nope. Forgot the eggs.

751
00:58:58,327 --> 00:58:59,535
I'm gonna get them now.

752
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:01,287
No, you most certainly will not.

753
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:03,456
Not at this hour.

754
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,168
Look at me, Peter.

755
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:11,505
Take off the damn hood
and look at me.

756
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:22,308
Peter. Where do you go?

757
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:23,935
Who does this to you?

758
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,895
Please go to sleep, Aunt May.

759
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:28,064
- Please tell me.
- Aunt May, please...

760
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:30,274
...please, please go to sleep.

761
00:59:30,442 --> 00:59:33,486
I can't sleep.
Don't you understand? I can't sleep.

762
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,500
Peter, listen to me.

763
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:49,418
Secrets have a cost.

764
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,128
They're not for free.

765
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:53,506
Not now, not ever.

766
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,182
Cross-species genetics
is finally working.

767
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:06,686
I've used the lizard DNA
to help Freddy regrow that limb.

768
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,437
It's a miracle.

769
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,189
No, it's hard work and promise.

770
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:12,358
It's a step closer to the primate lab.

771
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:14,277
He doesn't have time
for every little step.

772
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,361
Little?

773
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,071
I just mean he can't wait.

774
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:18,906
Well, he'll have to.

775
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:20,992
Unless he wants to be a lab rat.

776
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,734
That's not what I'm saying.

777
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,370
So, what are you saying?

778
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,331
You have to start human trials.

779
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:28,791
Now.

780
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:31,127
No, I don't, and no, I won't.

781
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:33,254
- Well, then he's going to die.
- People die.

782
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,465
Even Norman Osborn.

783
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,633
We are not finished.

784
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:39,385
Human trials?

785
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:42,138
Where are you going
to find the people to volunteer?

786
01:00:42,306 --> 01:00:44,890
As far as anyone's concerned,
it's for a flu shot.

787
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,935
I might think the Veterans Hospital
is a place to start.

788
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:49,437
You've gotta be kidding me.

789
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:51,647
I don't think I am.

790
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:00,406
It's a little late for
shock and indignation.

791
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:01,699
About 15 years late.

792
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,743
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

793
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,411
Richard Parker wore it well.

794
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:08,414
On you, it's a cheap suit,
as it was then.

795
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:10,041
I had nothing to do with that.

796
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,751
Is that what you told his son?

797
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:18,716
I don't know what you're saying.

798
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:21,427
You don't know,
or you don't wanna know?

799
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,264
I'll remind you what happened.

800
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:28,893
Richard Parker said just about the same
thing then that you are saying now.

801
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:34,440
The clock is ticking, Dr. Connors.

802
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:37,193
I...

803
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,452
I won't.

804
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:50,289
Fine.

805
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:57,588
The formula is ours now anyway.

806
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:01,550
Say goodbye to that arm
you have dreamed of.

807
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,260
I'm shutting you down.

808
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:06,347
Have your office cleared out
by the morning.

809
01:02:06,515 --> 01:02:10,017
Your toys can be taken away too,
you know.

810
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,229
Right, Freddy?

811
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:29,495
- Hey.
- Hi.

812
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:30,454
How's it going?

813
01:02:30,622 --> 01:02:31,831
Where you headed?

814
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:35,376
- Monday, B track.
- Oh, it's Thursday.

815
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:37,503
- It's Thursday?
- What happened?

816
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:39,338
- What?
- Your eye, it looks bruised.

817
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:40,756
Oh, yeah, no, I don't...

818
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:42,550
Maybe I got a rash or...

819
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,510
It's bad.
Have you gone to the nurse?

820
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,472
Do you like branzino?

821
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:50,850
Like, a fish.

822
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,852
No, no. I know. I know.

823
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,229
Well, if you want...

824
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:59,900
...you can come to this address
at 8:00 tonight.

825
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,361
My mom's making branzino.

826
01:03:02,863 --> 01:03:04,280
So...

827
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:05,322
It's apartment...

828
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,825
...2016. I didn't write that part down.

829
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:09,326
I don't know why I...

830
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,328
- I'll remember it.
- Oh, okay.

831
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,872
2016.

832
01:04:20,941 --> 01:04:22,274
Hi.

833
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:24,860
How did you get out there?

834
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:27,279
The fire escape.

835
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:29,949
Your doorman's intimidating.

836
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,493
It's 20 storeys.

837
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,286
Yeah. It's all right.

838
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:40,459
- This is your room.
- Yes, this is my room.

839
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:42,294
Books.

840
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:43,963
Shoes.

841
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:46,090
Oh, hey...

842
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:48,509
I got your mom...

843
01:04:48,677 --> 01:04:50,052
...these.

844
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:51,303
Oh, lovely.

845
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:53,138
- Beautiful, right?
- Beautiful.

846
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:54,682
They were nice.

847
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:56,642
- No, they're beautiful.
- I'm sorry.

848
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:59,562
No, it's impressive.
They actually held together very well.

849
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,272
I'm gonna keep these.

850
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:03,482
You have your suit in there?

851
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:08,195
My suit?

852
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:10,739
It's for dinner. Are you gonna...?

853
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,032
Are you gonna wear that?

854
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,200
- That's...
- Hey, hon.

855
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:19,748
You must be Peter.

856
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,750
Dad, this is Peter.

857
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:25,629
Nice to meet you, sir.

858
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:27,965
Nice to meet you.

859
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:29,717
Dinner's ready.

860
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:31,844
Hope you like branzino.

861
01:05:32,012 --> 01:05:33,554
Who doesn't?

862
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:34,406
Emma, it's Curt.

863
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:37,368
- Is he there?
- I'm afraid not, doctor.

864
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:40,371
The car is taking him
to the Veterans Hospital in Brooklyn.

865
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:41,747
No. He can't, Emma.

866
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:44,208
You have to stop him. He...

867
01:06:44,376 --> 01:06:46,794
I would, but I always lose him
on the bridge.

868
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:49,922
I'll make sure Dr. Ratha returns your call
as soon as possible.

869
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:03,268
I'm going to Holton Avenue,
across the river. I'm in a hurry.

870
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,479
You want me to take
the tunnel or the bridge?

871
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:06,897
Bridge! Take the bridge.

872
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:08,399
All right, we'll do that.

873
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:09,650
Hey, you all right...

874
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:10,567
...back there?

875
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:12,152
You tweaking...

876
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,529
...man?

877
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,281
Just drive.

878
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,075
Okay.

879
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:25,833
You're having trouble there?

880
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,668
The head goes on the other...

881
01:07:27,836 --> 01:07:29,378
Help Gwen's friend with his fish.

882
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:30,754
Oh, I...

883
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:32,005
I got no idea.

884
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:33,716
First time.

885
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,467
- Branzino.
- George.

886
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,387
- Tell us about your day.
- Did you catch that spider guy yet?

887
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:40,139
No, we didn't catch him yet.

888
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,182
But we will. He's an amateur...

889
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:45,060
...who's assaulting civilians
in the dead of night.

890
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:47,104
He's clumsy, he leaves clues...

891
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:48,647
...but he's still dangerous.

892
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:50,983
He's assaulting people?

893
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:53,819
I'm not sure.

894
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:55,446
I mean, I saw that video...

895
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:57,573
...with him and the car thief, and...

896
01:07:57,741 --> 01:08:00,868
I think most people
would say that he was...

897
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:02,995
...providing a public service.

898
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:05,664
Most people would be wrong.

899
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:10,419
If I wanted the car thief off the street,
he'd already be off the street.

900
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:11,837
So why wasn't he then?

901
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:16,884
Let me illuminate you.

902
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:19,678
The car thief was leading us
to the people who run...

903
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:22,055
...the operation.
It's a six-month-long sting.

904
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:25,225
It's called strategy.
I'm sure you're aware of the term?

905
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:27,895
- You've heard about that in school?
- Yeah.

906
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:28,937
Good.

907
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,355
I know.

908
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:33,192
- He didn't know you had a plan.
- You seem to know...

909
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,110
...a lot about this.
Know something we don't?

910
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:37,571
- Whose side are you on?
- I'm not on anyone's side.

911
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:39,114
I saw a video on the Internet...

912
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:40,824
You saw the video on the Internet.

913
01:08:40,992 --> 01:08:43,202
- Well, then the case is closed.
- Well, no.

914
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:44,328
If you watch the video...

915
01:08:44,496 --> 01:08:45,954
Maybe send you a link?

916
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,790
It looks like he's trying to help.

917
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,834
On the Internet he's being made out
to look like a hero.

918
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:51,668
No, no.

919
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,545
I'm not saying he's a hero.

920
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:56,048
- What are you trying to say?
- He's trying to help.

921
01:08:56,216 --> 01:08:57,549
He's trying to do something
the police can't.

922
01:08:57,717 --> 01:08:59,092
Something the police can't?

923
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,803
- I don't know.
- What do you think we do?

924
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,513
Sit around eating doughnuts...

925
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,473
...with our thumbs
planted up our asses?

926
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:06,683
- George. George.
- Daddy.

927
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:07,601
- Up your what?
- Howard.

928
01:09:07,769 --> 01:09:09,603
He stands for what you stand for.

929
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:11,313
Protecting innocent people
from bad guys.

930
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:13,565
I stand for law and order.
That's what I stand for.

931
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:15,317
Okay? I wear a badge.

932
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:18,529
This guy wears a mask
like an outlaw.

933
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:21,240
He's hunting down criminals
that all look the same...

934
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,575
...like he's got some sort
of personal vendetta.

935
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:26,745
But he's not protecting
innocent people, Mr. Parker.

936
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:28,747
Let's get some air, Peter.

937
01:09:29,374 --> 01:09:31,542
- Dad, we need to talk.
- Yes, we do.

938
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,754
Thank you for having me. I'm sorry...

939
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:38,173
...if I insulted you.
It was not my intention.

940
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:41,677
- You're welcome.
- Branzino was real good, Mrs. Stacy.

941
01:09:41,845 --> 01:09:43,929
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

942
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,183
- Dad.
- Yeah?

943
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:56,859
Well, that was something.

944
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:01,405
I'm sorry. I thought he was
going to arrest me at one point.

945
01:10:01,573 --> 01:10:04,199
No, I wouldn't
have let him arrest you.

946
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:11,665
- What happened to your face?
- I wanna tell you something.

947
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:14,793
Okay.

948
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,216
I've been bitten...

949
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:26,430
So have I.

950
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:33,312
Okay.

951
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:37,316
Okay, okay, okay.
I gotta tell you this one thing.

952
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,234
I gotta tell you this one thing about...

953
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:42,237
...the vigilante and the car thief.
- Oh, okay.

954
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:44,072
What?

955
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,491
- No, no, no.
- I don't want to talk about that.

956
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,327
Forget that.
I won't talk about that.

957
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:50,746
- I'm gonna talk about me, okay?
- What about you?

958
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:54,750
It's impo... I wish I could just...

959
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:56,168
I can't. It's hard to say.

960
01:10:56,336 --> 01:10:57,336
Just say it.

961
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,630
- I don't know.
- Say it.

962
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:03,759
What? What?

963
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:08,931
What?

964
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:14,853
Okay, then forget it.

965
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:24,446
You?

966
01:11:33,081 --> 01:11:35,207
- You're Spider-Man.
- Shut up.

967
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:41,713
Gwen?

968
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:44,299
Gwen...

969
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:47,260
Your father wants you to come inside.

970
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:48,887
Okay.

971
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,055
- Okay?
- Yeah.

972
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:53,892
Gwen.

973
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:55,727
I'm coming.

974
01:12:27,218 --> 01:12:28,844
Oh, I'm in trouble.

975
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:53,410
Will you please...

976
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:55,454
...find out what is going on, Alfred?

977
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:03,754
Excellent.

978
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:08,050
Hey!

979
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:12,179
Hey! What is that?

980
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,222
- Oh, my God!
- I don't know!

981
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,807
Get back in the car!

982
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:24,858
Help!

983
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:07,192
Incoming!

984
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:28,880
Somebody help!

985
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:31,383
Help me! My kid is trapped!

986
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:42,310
I want my dad!

987
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:43,687
Dad!

988
01:14:43,855 --> 01:14:45,230
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Help!

989
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:46,064
Hey, buddy.

990
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:47,399
- It's okay.
- Get away.

991
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:49,484
- Help!
- Hey, look.

992
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:52,904
Just a normal guy, all right?

993
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:55,490
Wanna hold this?

994
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:57,993
Hold my mask.

995
01:14:58,619 --> 01:14:59,536
All right.

996
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,539
What's your name?

997
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:03,498
Jack?

998
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:06,084
- Yes.
- Let's get you out of here.

999
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:09,212
Okay, stay very still.

1000
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,213
All right.

1001
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:11,631
Okay, I got you.

1002
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:16,720
Okay, look.

1003
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:18,513
I'll undo the belt. You hold on...

1004
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:20,724
...to that seat in front of you.
On three?

1005
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:23,643
- All right.
- Okay, one, two, three.

1006
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:27,939
See how easy that was?
You did a great job.

1007
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:29,816
All right, okay.

1008
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:44,789
Jack, climb now.

1009
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,583
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1010
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:53,965
Put it on, the mask.

1011
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:55,550
It's gonna make you strong.

1012
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:57,469
Jack, trust me.

1013
01:15:57,637 --> 01:15:58,595
Put it on.

1014
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:02,015
There you go. That's it.
That's it, buddy.

1015
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:03,308
Okay, now, climb.

1016
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:04,476
Come on, Jack.

1017
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:08,897
Do me a favour.

1018
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:10,565
A little faster, okay, bud?

1019
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:13,151
You're doing great, buddy.
You're doing great.

1020
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:14,402
That's it. Keep coming.

1021
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:15,987
Keep it coming.

1022
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:17,197
Keep coming.

1023
01:16:18,115 --> 01:16:19,449
No!

1024
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,799
Jack. Oh, God.

1025
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:37,467
Thank God.

1026
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:40,512
You okay?

1027
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:45,016
My son. My son.

1028
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:46,977
Oh, my son.

1029
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:48,895
My son.

1030
01:16:53,401 --> 01:16:54,442
Who are you?

1031
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:58,363
Spider-Man.

1032
01:17:45,453 --> 01:17:47,412
Beautiful.

1033
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:56,629
Settle down, guys.

1034
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,257
Settle down, boys. Settle down.

1035
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:01,593
- Come on.
- Listen. At approximately...

1036
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:05,221
...9 p.m. Last night, an incident took
place on the Williamsburg Bridge.

1037
01:18:05,765 --> 01:18:07,599
Much of what occurred
is speculation...

1038
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:10,560
...at this point.
However, several eyewitnesses...

1039
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:14,147
...to the crime, as well
as our own preliminary findings, have...

1040
01:18:14,315 --> 01:18:15,440
...positively placed...

1041
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:17,275
...one individual at the scene.

1042
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:18,902
Which is why, this morning...

1043
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:20,487
...I am issuing a warrant...

1044
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:23,990
...for the masked vigilante
known as Spider-Man.

1045
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:33,625
And lastly, city council members met
with homeowners and airport officials...

1046
01:18:33,793 --> 01:18:35,460
...in the first of four meetings...

1047
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,135
It's so beautiful.

1048
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:46,137
Knows how to bite though.

1049
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:48,056
Who else knows about this?

1050
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:49,099
Just you.

1051
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:50,517
Really?

1052
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:54,896
Hey, you don't...

1053
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:58,233
You don't believe what the police
are saying, do you?

1054
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:00,610
Of course not.

1055
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,988
Does it scare you?

1056
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:05,990
What you can do?

1057
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:12,038
No.

1058
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,125
What did that thing
on the bridge look like?

1059
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:18,128
It was real big.
Too big to be human.

1060
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:20,046
You gotta lay low.

1061
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,215
No, can't do that.

1062
01:19:22,425 --> 01:19:23,967
You've got to.

1063
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:26,302
I mean, why?

1064
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:29,097
Because of last night.

1065
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:31,266
Those people on the bridge.

1066
01:19:31,434 --> 01:19:35,437
Whatever was attacking them
would have killed them.

1067
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:37,772
So...

1068
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,607
...I gotta go after it.

1069
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:42,152
That's not your job.

1070
01:19:43,571 --> 01:19:45,155
Maybe it is.

1071
01:19:50,077 --> 01:19:51,619
I really liked kissing you.

1072
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:55,748
You're an amazing kisser.

1073
01:19:58,544 --> 01:19:59,711
Well, you know, it was...

1074
01:19:59,879 --> 01:20:01,880
It was good for me too.

1075
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:06,176
Yeah?

1076
01:20:15,603 --> 01:20:16,728
Who did that?

1077
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:39,459
Hello!

1078
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:51,304
It's not nice to snoop.

1079
01:20:54,225 --> 01:20:56,100
I gave everyone the week off.

1080
01:20:58,354 --> 01:20:59,020
Yeah.

1081
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:01,606
Shouldn't you be at school?

1082
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,401
No, I got a free track.

1083
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:07,570
I wanted to ask you a question.

1084
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,322
How would a predator...

1085
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:10,782
...track a reptile?

1086
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:13,785
Oh, they don't.
Most reptiles are at the top...

1087
01:21:13,953 --> 01:21:15,203
...of their food chain.

1088
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:16,871
Kings of their domain.

1089
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:18,540
They gotta have vulnerabilities.

1090
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:21,292
Why the sudden interest
in the cold-blooded?

1091
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:26,089
Just asking a question.

1092
01:21:26,257 --> 01:21:29,092
I got school stuff.

1093
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:31,261
Biology profiles to do.

1094
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:33,930
So because of the cold blood...

1095
01:21:34,098 --> 01:21:36,015
...would they react to changes
in temperatures?

1096
01:21:36,183 --> 01:21:37,559
You'd have to catch one first.

1097
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:41,771
Did you know there's a rumour
of a new species in New York?

1098
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:43,439
Beautiful and quite large.

1099
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:46,568
What do you know about it?
You seen it?

1100
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:48,736
No, it's not yet classified.

1101
01:21:51,699 --> 01:21:53,700
But it can be aggressive...

1102
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:55,535
...if threatened.

1103
01:22:03,294 --> 01:22:04,544
Doc, you all right?

1104
01:22:04,712 --> 01:22:07,338
Never been better, Peter.
Never been better.

1105
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:09,048
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1106
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:11,968
Afraid I have to ask you to leave.
I have a new project...

1107
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:14,554
...I'm working on.
I need to be alone.

1108
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,473
Good. Good, good.

1109
01:22:18,017 --> 01:22:19,851
Good.

1110
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:23,146
Don't worry, Mr. Parker.
I'll be back.

1111
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,482
Wonderful things are coming.

1112
01:22:27,735 --> 01:22:29,527
Wonderful things.

1113
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:45,376
Fred?

1114
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:52,383
Mr. Mayor,
if there was a giant dinosaur...

1115
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:55,053
...running around
you would be the first to know.

1116
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:57,764
So tell your son
he can rest easy, all right?

1117
01:22:57,931 --> 01:22:59,974
Yeah. You and me both, sir.

1118
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:02,352
Okay. Bye-bye.

1119
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:04,395
Mr. Parker, why are you...

1120
01:23:04,563 --> 01:23:06,397
...not in school?
- Got a free track.

1121
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:07,815
Okay, well, I do not.

1122
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,233
So make your point quickly.

1123
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:11,778
Fine, there may not be a dinosaur
running around.

1124
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:14,238
There is something more dangerous,
and I know who.

1125
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:15,990
- You know who?
- Dr. Curtis Connors.

1126
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:17,533
- He's a biochemist.
- Of Oscorp?

1127
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:19,202
- That's right.
- Dr. Connors...

1128
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:21,371
...who's my daughter's mentor.
Is that who?

1129
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:22,747
- That's the one.
- Okay.

1130
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:26,209
Recently, Dr. Connors gave Gwen
a college recommendation.

1131
01:23:26,377 --> 01:23:28,419
It was beautiful.
When I read it, I cried.

1132
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:30,755
You would have me believe
that he...

1133
01:23:30,923 --> 01:23:33,132
...is running around dressed up
like a dinosaur?

1134
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:36,969
Not dressing up and not a dinosaur.
He has transformed himself into a lizard.

1135
01:23:40,224 --> 01:23:41,766
Let me ask you a question.

1136
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:45,061
Do I look like the mayor
of Tokyo to you?

1137
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:47,689
I'm telling you the absolute truth.

1138
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:50,900
This man has worked for his whole life
on cross-species genetics.

1139
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:54,612
He lost an arm, he tried to grow it back,
but the equation was imbalanced.

1140
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:57,240
He has turned into a lizard.
He's using lizard DNA.

1141
01:23:57,408 --> 01:24:01,119
He is dangerous, and he is planning
something horrific. I know. I know.

1142
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:03,746
Okay. All right, I get it.

1143
01:24:04,623 --> 01:24:05,665
Here's what we'll do.

1144
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:08,918
You'll go back to hanging out
with the citizens of Tokyo.

1145
01:24:09,086 --> 01:24:11,295
I'm gonna go back
to protecting the citizens...

1146
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:13,506
...of this fine, fair city of ours.

1147
01:24:13,674 --> 01:24:15,925
Sergeant Butler,
please escort Mr. Parker...

1148
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:19,053
...back to school.
- Captain Stacy, I'm not messing around.

1149
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:22,265
Just bring him in. Just call him in.
You have to call him in.

1150
01:24:22,433 --> 01:24:24,058
He is a danger to everybody.

1151
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:26,477
- Just, please, listen to me.
- Let's go.

1152
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:32,150
Jimmy.

1153
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,237
Get me everything we have
on Dr. Curtis Connors.

1154
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:38,740
- Okay? Right away.
- Yeah.

1155
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:06,309
Subject: Dr. Curtis Connors.

1156
01:25:06,477 --> 01:25:08,019
Current temperature: 89.7.

1157
01:25:08,187 --> 01:25:09,645
Steady for 48 hours.

1158
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:12,315
Blood panels reveal
lymphocyte and monocyte readings...

1159
01:25:12,483 --> 01:25:14,150
...consistent with subject's past.

1160
01:25:19,907 --> 01:25:21,574
Clotting rate vastly improved.

1161
01:25:21,742 --> 01:25:23,242
Marked enhancement...

1162
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:24,744
...in muscle response...

1163
01:25:24,912 --> 01:25:26,287
...strength and elasticity.

1164
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,214
Eyesight similarly improved.

1165
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:38,883
Subject no longer requires
corrective lenses.

1166
01:25:44,223 --> 01:25:46,140
This is no longer about curing ills.

1167
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:48,059
This is about...

1168
01:25:48,227 --> 01:25:49,310
...finding perfection.

1169
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:00,655
In attempt to redress
regenerative relapse...

1170
01:26:00,823 --> 01:26:04,575
...dosage has been increased
to 200 milligrams.

1171
01:27:39,379 --> 01:27:41,130
You stopped me once.

1172
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:44,342
You won't stop me again.

1173
01:27:46,345 --> 01:27:49,347
I'm getting stronger every day!

1174
01:28:28,095 --> 01:28:29,637
Oh, that sucked.

1175
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:42,733
Peter Parker.

1176
01:29:00,419 --> 01:29:01,961
Come in.

1177
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:05,756
You should maybe...

1178
01:29:05,924 --> 01:29:07,758
...consider coming in
through the lobby.

1179
01:29:09,386 --> 01:29:12,430
Also, my father is under
the impression...

1180
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:15,433
...that you require psychiatric attention.
- Oh, really?

1181
01:29:15,684 --> 01:29:17,268
Peter.

1182
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:18,811
What happened?

1183
01:29:18,979 --> 01:29:20,312
You should see the other guy.

1184
01:29:22,149 --> 01:29:26,569
The other guy, in this instance,
being a giant mutant lizard.

1185
01:29:26,737 --> 01:29:27,737
Hey, Gwen, honey.

1186
01:29:27,904 --> 01:29:28,821
Do you want cocoa?

1187
01:29:28,989 --> 01:29:30,114
Howard's making some.

1188
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:36,120
No, Dad, I do not want cocoa.

1189
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:37,955
Honestly, I'm 17 years old.

1190
01:29:38,123 --> 01:29:38,956
Okay.

1191
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:43,169
I remembered somebody saying her
fantasy was to live in a chocolate house.

1192
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:44,795
Well, that's impractical.

1193
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:46,380
And fattening.

1194
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:50,718
Chocolate house.

1195
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:55,389
- Sorry, Dad.
- It's good.

1196
01:29:55,557 --> 01:29:58,350
I can't have cocoa right now
because I'm work...

1197
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:01,604
I'm doing this...

1198
01:30:01,772 --> 01:30:03,397
I have cramps.

1199
01:30:04,274 --> 01:30:06,317
I feel kind of pukey and just sort of...

1200
01:30:06,485 --> 01:30:08,778
- Like, emotional. I keep crying.
- It's okay. Good.

1201
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:10,654
- Good.
- It's brutal.

1202
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:12,865
You don't want to know.

1203
01:30:13,033 --> 01:30:14,200
- It's, like, bad.
- Got it.

1204
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:16,327
- Thanks, Daddy.
- All right.

1205
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:43,854
Easy, Bug Boy.

1206
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:46,023
What'd you call me?

1207
01:30:51,113 --> 01:30:52,947
I'm going to be all right.

1208
01:30:53,115 --> 01:30:55,825
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

1209
01:30:57,202 --> 01:30:59,703
I know what this is.

1210
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:01,205
What is it?

1211
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:05,292
Every day, for as long
as I can remember, my father...

1212
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,919
...has left every morning...

1213
01:31:07,087 --> 01:31:09,755
...and he's put a badge on his chest...

1214
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:12,216
...and strapped a gun to his hip.

1215
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:17,263
And every day,
for as long as I can remember...

1216
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:19,890
...I haven't known if he was
gonna make it home.

1217
01:31:29,442 --> 01:31:31,277
I got you.

1218
01:31:32,529 --> 01:31:37,408
Okay?

1219
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:41,078
I gotta stop him, though.

1220
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:44,665
I have to, because I created him.

1221
01:31:47,961 --> 01:31:49,420
What do you mean?

1222
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:52,923
I gave him an equation...

1223
01:31:55,468 --> 01:31:57,595
...that made all of this possible.

1224
01:32:05,228 --> 01:32:08,105
Something my father
had been working on, you know.

1225
01:32:08,273 --> 01:32:11,275
Secretly. Now I realise
why he kept it a secret.

1226
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:16,530
Point is, this is my responsibility.

1227
01:32:19,868 --> 01:32:22,036
I have to fix it.

1228
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:26,790
Peter.

1229
01:32:27,834 --> 01:32:29,543
Hey.

1230
01:32:32,839 --> 01:32:34,965
Let's get out of here.

1231
01:32:35,133 --> 01:32:36,926
Let's just get out of here.

1232
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:38,802
Just for a minute. Can we?

1233
01:32:39,512 --> 01:32:41,472
- No. No.
- Yeah. Yes.

1234
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:42,806
- Yes.
- No.

1235
01:32:42,974 --> 01:32:44,141
Yes.

1236
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:46,810
If my parents see me leaving,
I'm dead.

1237
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:53,484
Your parents aren't
gonna see you leaving.

1238
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:08,457
Peter Parker.

1239
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:10,292
Spider-Man.

1240
01:33:10,669 --> 01:33:12,419
I'm not the one who needs...

1241
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:13,879
...help.

1242
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:15,756
There will be no more loneliness...

1243
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:17,383
...no more outcasts.

1244
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:21,303
Species-wide distribution
could enhance...

1245
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:23,847
...humanity on an evolutionary scale.

1246
01:33:24,307 --> 01:33:26,642
One has to adapt to survive.

1247
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:32,731
"That, changing like the snake,
I might be free...

1248
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:36,527
...to cast off flesh
wherein I dwell confined."

1249
01:33:36,695 --> 01:33:39,863
Would you give it all up
after all you know...

1250
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:40,990
...you can do?

1251
01:33:41,157 --> 01:33:43,784
All the power you feel.

1252
01:33:47,289 --> 01:33:48,539
I can save...

1253
01:33:48,707 --> 01:33:49,623
...them!

1254
01:33:56,339 --> 01:33:57,339
You won't get in...

1255
01:33:57,507 --> 01:33:58,674
...the way of my plan...

1256
01:33:58,842 --> 01:34:00,467
...Peter Parker!

1257
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:28,120
Go. Go!

1258
01:35:04,491 --> 01:35:06,492
Nowhere to hide, Peter.

1259
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:25,052
All these souls...

1260
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:26,470
...lost and alone.

1261
01:35:26,638 --> 01:35:27,513
I can save them.

1262
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:29,306
I can cure them.

1263
01:35:29,474 --> 01:35:31,058
There's no need to stop me...

1264
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:32,142
...Peter.

1265
01:35:41,694 --> 01:35:43,779
You're not thinking straight, doc.

1266
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:49,118
Stop this. This isn't you.

1267
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:55,249
Let's talk this out.

1268
01:35:56,376 --> 01:35:57,126
Doc!

1269
01:36:03,216 --> 01:36:04,258
Oh, boy.

1270
01:36:09,848 --> 01:36:10,889
You don't want to talk?

1271
01:36:11,724 --> 01:36:13,267
There you go.

1272
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:18,105
Don't...

1273
01:36:18,898 --> 01:36:20,274
...make me...

1274
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:21,650
...have to...

1275
01:36:22,152 --> 01:36:23,110
...hurt you!

1276
01:36:30,994 --> 01:36:32,327
That is disgusting.

1277
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:43,755
Gwen.

1278
01:37:07,697 --> 01:37:09,907
- I'm gonna throw you out the window.
- What?

1279
01:37:23,129 --> 01:37:24,171
Somebody's been...

1280
01:37:24,339 --> 01:37:26,006
...a bad lizard.

1281
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:14,972
This is Lieutenant Williams
from the New York City...

1282
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:18,600
...Police Department.
We've got this building surrounded.

1283
01:38:27,777 --> 01:38:29,570
Alpha, let's move ahead. Go!

1284
01:38:41,416 --> 01:38:42,708
- Hey.
- Where are you?

1285
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:43,792
I'm fine. I'm okay.

1286
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:47,337
I'm in the sewer, tracking him.
I gotta stop him before anyone gets hurt.

1287
01:38:47,505 --> 01:38:48,630
But we need an antidote.

1288
01:38:48,798 --> 01:38:51,383
- Do you know how to run a serum?
- I do it all the time.

1289
01:38:51,551 --> 01:38:53,969
Okay, great.
Okay, I need you to go to Oscorp.

1290
01:38:54,137 --> 01:38:57,139
I need you to access
the cross-species file. It's a blue serum.

1291
01:38:57,307 --> 01:38:59,433
File 12389.

1292
01:38:59,601 --> 01:39:00,684
Okay, got it.

1293
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:02,603
On my way.

1294
01:39:34,093 --> 01:39:37,721
I spent my life as a scientist trying
to create a world without weakness...

1295
01:39:37,889 --> 01:39:40,057
...without outcasts.

1296
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:42,768
I sought to create
a stronger human being...

1297
01:39:42,935 --> 01:39:44,853
...but there's no such thing.

1298
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:48,273
Human beings are weak,
pathetic, feeble-minded...

1299
01:39:48,441 --> 01:39:50,108
...creatures.

1300
01:39:50,276 --> 01:39:51,735
Why be human at all...

1301
01:39:51,903 --> 01:39:53,153
...when we can be so...

1302
01:39:53,321 --> 01:39:54,154
...much more?

1303
01:39:54,322 --> 01:39:56,615
Faster. Stronger.

1304
01:39:56,783 --> 01:39:58,200
Smarter.

1305
01:39:58,368 --> 01:40:01,203
This is my gift to you.

1306
01:40:09,712 --> 01:40:11,380
Oscorp.

1307
01:40:13,633 --> 01:40:14,758
- Captain Stacy!
- What?

1308
01:40:14,926 --> 01:40:17,386
We have a confirmed sighting, sir.
The Lizard's headed...

1309
01:40:17,553 --> 01:40:19,763
...toward Canal Street.
- What about Spider-Man?

1310
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:21,139
Inside the high school.

1311
01:40:21,307 --> 01:40:23,225
I want that Spider-Man off the street.

1312
01:42:10,208 --> 01:42:12,709
The lizard creature
has released a biological agent.

1313
01:42:12,877 --> 01:42:14,669
All efforts to stop him have failed...

1314
01:42:14,837 --> 01:42:18,048
...and he is now proceeding
north on 7th Avenue. Over.

1315
01:42:22,053 --> 01:42:22,928
- Hi.
- Where are you?

1316
01:42:23,095 --> 01:42:24,387
Peter, hi. I'm at Oscorp.

1317
01:42:24,555 --> 01:42:26,306
You have to get out of there now.

1318
01:42:26,474 --> 01:42:28,850
- The antidote is cooking.
- No, no, no.

1319
01:42:29,018 --> 01:42:31,478
Connors is on the way.
He's coming to you right now.

1320
01:42:31,646 --> 01:42:34,189
He needs the device.
He's gonna infect the whole city!

1321
01:42:34,357 --> 01:42:35,524
Eight minutes left.

1322
01:42:35,691 --> 01:42:38,235
You're gonna wait eight minutes
after what I told you?

1323
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:39,736
You leave right now.

1324
01:42:39,904 --> 01:42:40,946
That is an order, okay?

1325
01:42:41,113 --> 01:42:42,197
I'll get everybody out.

1326
01:42:42,365 --> 01:42:43,865
Did you hear wh...?

1327
01:42:44,033 --> 01:42:47,077
Gwen! Gwen! You Mother Hubbard.
Are you serious?

1328
01:43:03,594 --> 01:43:04,761
He's heading south.

1329
01:43:15,523 --> 01:43:17,524
Stand down now, or we will open fire.

1330
01:43:17,692 --> 01:43:19,442
You are surrounded. There is...

1331
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:20,944
...no escape.

1332
01:43:21,404 --> 01:43:22,821
Go, go!

1333
01:44:24,759 --> 01:44:26,134
Clear!

1334
01:44:26,302 --> 01:44:27,427
Clear up top!

1335
01:44:29,263 --> 01:44:30,513
Clear, sir!

1336
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:31,848
All clear here, sir!

1337
01:44:57,333 --> 01:44:58,875
Freeze!

1338
01:44:59,543 --> 01:45:00,710
Down on the ground.

1339
01:45:00,878 --> 01:45:02,337
Your hands behind your head.

1340
01:45:02,505 --> 01:45:04,130
Now!

1341
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:08,969
Parker.

1342
01:45:10,846 --> 01:45:11,846
It's headed to Oscorp!

1343
01:45:12,014 --> 01:45:14,391
And your daughter's there right now.

1344
01:45:27,154 --> 01:45:28,446
You gotta let me go.

1345
01:45:43,045 --> 01:45:43,795
Hold your fire!

1346
01:45:50,886 --> 01:45:53,388
Well, Paul, if I didn't see it,
I wouldn't believe it.

1347
01:45:53,556 --> 01:45:55,974
I won't venture to say
what it is crawling up...

1348
01:45:56,142 --> 01:45:58,059
...the north side
of the Oscorp Tower...

1349
01:45:58,227 --> 01:46:01,479
...but clearly it is not human
and it is very, very strong.

1350
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:19,789
Time remaining: One minute.

1351
01:47:32,738 --> 01:47:34,823
Antidote complete.

1352
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:49,379
Oh, man.

1353
01:47:49,547 --> 01:47:52,215
We're getting the latest details.
This is just coming in.

1354
01:47:52,383 --> 01:47:54,050
The New York Police Department...

1355
01:47:54,218 --> 01:47:56,219
...has called for
a city-wide evacuation...

1356
01:47:56,387 --> 01:47:58,346
...everything south of 54th Street.

1357
01:47:59,181 --> 01:48:00,974
If you are south of 54th Street...

1358
01:48:01,142 --> 01:48:03,601
...you have to move out
of the area immediately.

1359
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:15,655
Spider-Man appears
to be heading towards Oscorp.

1360
01:48:15,823 --> 01:48:16,865
He looks injured...

1361
01:48:17,032 --> 01:48:19,701
...and it's really not clear
if he's gonna make it.

1362
01:48:19,869 --> 01:48:20,952
That's the guy who...

1363
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,495
...saved my boy on the bridge.

1364
01:48:22,663 --> 01:48:24,038
Troy, they're clearing us out.

1365
01:48:24,206 --> 01:48:26,624
Something bad's
going down in Midtown.

1366
01:48:26,792 --> 01:48:29,377
Still friends with Matthews,
that crane operator on 6th?

1367
01:48:29,545 --> 01:48:31,462
- Yeah.
- Get him on the phone for me.

1368
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:33,715
The cops are evacuating everybody.

1369
01:48:33,883 --> 01:48:36,092
Get him on the phone for me.

1370
01:48:53,694 --> 01:48:56,321
Hey, Charlie, get me Enriquez
on 54th Street!

1371
01:48:56,488 --> 01:48:58,573
- You got it.
- Angelo, get your mug over here.

1372
01:48:58,741 --> 01:49:01,075
Wolski! You're getting some overtime!

1373
01:49:02,453 --> 01:49:04,412
All tower cranes on 6th...

1374
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:08,291
...swing your jib arms over the avenue.
Boom angles at 90 degrees.

1375
01:49:08,459 --> 01:49:10,793
Spider-Man needs those big boys
high and lined up.

1376
01:49:10,961 --> 01:49:13,004
Let's give him a clear approach. Over.

1377
01:49:46,747 --> 01:49:48,414
Come on, Parker.

1378
01:51:44,156 --> 01:51:44,864
Hey.

1379
01:51:45,157 --> 01:51:46,240
Dad!

1380
01:51:46,408 --> 01:51:48,576
- I have to get this to Spider-Man.
- Get in.

1381
01:51:48,744 --> 01:51:50,578
- It can stop the Lizard.
- Get in the car.

1382
01:51:50,746 --> 01:51:53,623
- You don't understand!
- Yes, I do.

1383
01:51:53,791 --> 01:51:56,042
Your boyfriend
is a man of many masks.

1384
01:51:56,210 --> 01:51:57,377
I get it.

1385
01:51:57,544 --> 01:51:58,628
Give me this.

1386
01:51:58,796 --> 01:52:00,630
Get in the car.

1387
01:52:04,218 --> 01:52:06,302
Please make sure he's okay.

1388
01:52:18,816 --> 01:52:21,818
Initializing Ganali device.

1389
01:52:21,985 --> 01:52:24,987
Detonation in T-minus two minutes.

1390
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:49,822
Poor Peter Parker.

1391
01:53:50,949 --> 01:53:54,744
No mother, no father...

1392
01:53:55,871 --> 01:53:57,622
...no uncle.

1393
01:53:58,790 --> 01:54:00,666
All alone.

1394
01:54:01,919 --> 01:54:02,919
He's not alone.

1395
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:24,565
Detonation in T-minus 45 seconds.

1396
01:54:33,450 --> 01:54:34,242
Hey!

1397
01:54:34,409 --> 01:54:35,159
Gift from Gwen.

1398
01:54:37,663 --> 01:54:39,121
I got this, Peter! Go!

1399
01:54:45,045 --> 01:54:46,796
T-minus...

1400
01:54:46,964 --> 01:54:48,130
...30 seconds.

1401
01:55:05,899 --> 01:55:07,358
Detonation in T-minus...

1402
01:55:07,526 --> 01:55:09,235
...10 seconds.

1403
01:55:09,695 --> 01:55:10,695
Nine.

1404
01:55:11,905 --> 01:55:13,447
Eight.

1405
01:55:13,615 --> 01:55:14,991
Seven.

1406
01:55:15,492 --> 01:55:16,784
Six.

1407
01:55:17,578 --> 01:55:18,869
Five.

1408
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:20,288
Four.

1409
01:55:21,248 --> 01:55:22,248
Three.

1410
01:55:24,001 --> 01:55:24,667
Two.

1411
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:27,086
One.

1412
01:55:52,863 --> 01:55:54,530
No.

1413
01:55:56,033 --> 01:55:58,034
No!

1414
01:57:09,106 --> 01:57:10,231
The captain.

1415
01:57:11,775 --> 01:57:13,275
Captain!

1416
01:57:15,946 --> 01:57:17,363
The Lizard.

1417
01:57:17,531 --> 01:57:18,239
It's okay.

1418
01:57:18,407 --> 01:57:19,615
We stopped him.

1419
01:57:20,283 --> 01:57:21,158
Okay.

1420
01:57:21,326 --> 01:57:23,494
Let's get you out of here.
Come on.

1421
01:57:24,830 --> 01:57:26,163
Okay, okay, okay.

1422
01:57:26,331 --> 01:57:27,790
Look at me. Stay with me.

1423
01:57:27,958 --> 01:57:30,042
- Help's on the way, okay?
- You need to...

1424
01:57:30,210 --> 01:57:33,713
You need to be gone
when they get here.

1425
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:35,214
Okay?

1426
01:57:35,382 --> 01:57:36,674
I'm not going anywhere.

1427
01:57:37,259 --> 01:57:39,677
I was wrong about you, Peter.

1428
01:57:40,387 --> 01:57:41,929
This city needs you.

1429
01:57:43,932 --> 01:57:45,516
Here.

1430
01:57:45,684 --> 01:57:46,851
You're gonna need this.

1431
01:57:51,273 --> 01:57:53,232
You're gonna make enemies.

1432
01:57:55,652 --> 01:57:57,486
People will get hurt.

1433
01:57:59,072 --> 01:58:00,990
Sometimes the people closest to you.

1434
01:58:04,911 --> 01:58:06,912
So I want you to promise me
something, okay?

1435
01:58:08,832 --> 01:58:12,626
Leave Gwen out of it.

1436
01:58:15,172 --> 01:58:16,797
Promise me that.

1437
01:58:22,429 --> 01:58:24,096
You promise me.

1438
01:59:37,796 --> 01:59:39,046
An eerie calm...

1439
01:59:39,214 --> 01:59:41,257
...has set in over New York City.

1440
01:59:41,424 --> 01:59:42,716
Apparently, some sort of...

1441
01:59:42,884 --> 01:59:45,886
...aerosolized antidote
was launched from...

1442
01:59:46,054 --> 01:59:49,265
...Oscorp Tower, which seems to have
counteracted the biotoxins.

1443
01:59:49,432 --> 01:59:52,393
Residents of Lower Manhattan
can rest peacefully...

1444
01:59:52,561 --> 01:59:54,562
...knowing that
the alleged mastermind...

1445
01:59:54,729 --> 01:59:58,357
...of this terror plot,
Dr. Curtis Connors, is behind bars.

1446
01:59:58,525 --> 01:59:59,900
We've got John Niles...

1447
02:00:00,068 --> 02:00:02,486
...on the street for a report
in Lower Manhattan.

1448
02:00:02,654 --> 02:00:04,697
John, what do you see?

1449
02:00:37,564 --> 02:00:39,607
Sweetheart, it's all right.

1450
02:00:41,776 --> 02:00:46,155
It's all right.

1451
02:00:46,656 --> 02:00:47,615
Rough night.

1452
02:00:49,701 --> 02:00:51,368
It's gonna be all right.

1453
02:01:45,131 --> 02:01:46,840
Where have you been?

1454
02:01:49,844 --> 02:01:51,428
Hi.

1455
02:01:56,267 --> 02:01:57,893
My father died.

1456
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:03,607
There was a funeral.

1457
02:02:05,068 --> 02:02:06,402
They shot off...

1458
02:02:08,405 --> 02:02:11,156
...rifles and they made speeches.

1459
02:02:14,703 --> 02:02:16,662
Two of my teachers showed up.

1460
02:02:18,081 --> 02:02:19,456
And Flash showed up.

1461
02:02:24,379 --> 02:02:27,006
Everyone was there but you.

1462
02:02:41,604 --> 02:02:43,731
Can't do this. Can't do this.

1463
02:02:45,984 --> 02:02:48,027
I'm sorry. I can't...

1464
02:02:48,194 --> 02:02:49,611
What are you saying?

1465
02:02:49,779 --> 02:02:51,613
I can't see you anymore.

1466
02:02:53,575 --> 02:02:55,034
I can't.

1467
02:03:20,643 --> 02:03:22,644
He made you promise, didn't he?

1468
02:03:26,649 --> 02:03:30,527
To stay away from me, so I'd be safe.

1469
02:03:57,013 --> 02:03:57,846
What a pretty...

1470
02:03:58,014 --> 02:03:58,889
...girl.

1471
02:03:59,057 --> 02:04:00,224
Yeah.

1472
02:04:00,391 --> 02:04:02,184
That's what Uncle Ben said.

1473
02:04:03,228 --> 02:04:04,895
Did you ask her out?

1474
02:04:08,650 --> 02:04:09,983
Why?

1475
02:04:11,069 --> 02:04:12,528
Can't.

1476
02:04:13,822 --> 02:04:15,197
Why?

1477
02:04:17,784 --> 02:04:19,493
I'm just no good for her.

1478
02:04:22,664 --> 02:04:26,125
Peter Parker, if there's
one thing you are, it's good.

1479
02:04:27,168 --> 02:04:28,335
Anyone has a problem...

1480
02:04:28,503 --> 02:04:30,212
...with that can talk to me.

1481
02:04:47,939 --> 02:04:50,983
Peter, I know things have been...

1482
02:04:51,151 --> 02:04:52,359
...difficult lately...

1483
02:04:52,527 --> 02:04:54,611
...and I'm sorry about that.

1484
02:04:55,029 --> 02:04:57,990
I think I know what you're feeling.

1485
02:04:58,158 --> 02:05:00,742
Ever since you were a little boy...

1486
02:05:00,910 --> 02:05:05,330
...you've been living with
so many unresolved things.

1487
02:05:06,541 --> 02:05:08,834
Well, take it from an old man:

1488
02:05:09,419 --> 02:05:12,504
Those things send us
down a road.

1489
02:05:12,672 --> 02:05:13,755
They make us...

1490
02:05:13,923 --> 02:05:15,007
...who we are.

1491
02:05:15,258 --> 02:05:20,512
And if anyone's destined for greatness,
it's you, son.

1492
02:05:21,097 --> 02:05:23,515
You owe the world your gifts.

1493
02:05:24,100 --> 02:05:26,977
You just have to figure out
how to use them.

1494
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:30,856
And know that wherever
they take you...

1495
02:05:31,024 --> 02:05:33,317
...we'll always be here.

1496
02:05:34,152 --> 02:05:36,737
So come on home, Peter.

1497
02:05:37,614 --> 02:05:39,448
You're my hero.

1498
02:05:39,616 --> 02:05:41,116
And I love you.

1499
02:05:49,542 --> 02:05:51,251
- What's up, Parker?
- What's up?

1500
02:05:51,419 --> 02:05:52,878
Hey. How's it going?

1501
02:05:53,838 --> 02:05:55,214
You coming along, man?

1502
02:05:56,799 --> 02:05:57,633
Cool shirt.

1503
02:05:59,510 --> 02:06:00,636
Yeah.

1504
02:06:00,803 --> 02:06:02,304
Dude's crazy.

1505
02:06:02,472 --> 02:06:03,847
But chicks dig him.

1506
02:06:06,643 --> 02:06:09,353
Come on, guys, you heard the bell.
Get to class.

1507
02:06:18,821 --> 02:06:21,698
I had a professor once
who liked to tell his students...

1508
02:06:21,866 --> 02:06:25,118
...that there were only 10 different plots
in all of fiction.

1509
02:06:26,079 --> 02:06:28,163
Well, I'm here to tell you
he was wrong.

1510
02:06:28,331 --> 02:06:29,748
There is only one:

1511
02:06:30,667 --> 02:06:32,167
"Who am I"?

1512
02:06:32,877 --> 02:06:34,795
Mr. Parker.

1513
02:06:34,963 --> 02:06:35,963
Tardy again.

1514
02:06:37,924 --> 02:06:39,758
At least we can always count on you.

1515
02:06:39,926 --> 02:06:42,678
Sorry, Miss Ritter,
won't happen again, I promise.

1516
02:06:42,845 --> 02:06:44,930
Don't make promises you can't keep.

1517
02:06:47,183 --> 02:06:49,351
Yeah, but those are the best kind.

1518
02:06:49,519 --> 02:06:51,353
Okay, class, open your books.

1519
02:06:51,521 --> 02:06:53,522
Let's begin on page one.

1520
02:09:48,781 --> 02:09:51,366
Hello, doctor.

1521
02:09:51,534 --> 02:09:52,868
Did you tell the boy?

1522
02:09:53,035 --> 02:09:54,077
Tell him what?

1523
02:09:54,245 --> 02:09:57,998
Did you tell the boy
the truth about his father?

1524
02:09:59,667 --> 02:10:00,542
No.

1525
02:10:00,710 --> 02:10:02,294
Well, that's very good.

1526
02:10:02,628 --> 02:10:03,712
So we'll let him be...

1527
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:04,838
...for now.

1528
02:10:05,882 --> 02:10:07,966
You should leave him alone!

1529
02:10:08,305 --> 02:11:08,824
