WENDY: At the moment
Kenny time traveled,

00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,475
he blew all the transformers
here in the lab.

If you're going to try

we'll be doing it
at half capacity.

The bigger problem
is that we can't even get

into half of Kenny's equipment.

146

We have access to the machines,

147
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:20,823

So we go to the asylum

00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:48,003
no capital to see 'em through.
Let me help you out with that."

314
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,237
You know,
he's a really great guy.

315
00:14:49,304 --> 00:14:50,539
Let me get you all together.

316
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:52,374
Maybe you can all
do a lunch or something.

317
00:14:52,441 --> 00:14:54,676
Victor, Kenny's dead.

318
00:14:54,743 --> 00:14:57,579
Oh, whoa, bummer alert.
(chuckles)

319
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,816
Just goes to show you, huh,
there's never enough time to get

320
00:15:00,882 --> 00:15:02,351
out there
and make the kind of money

321
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:03,919
you always dreamed of making.

322
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,320
Well, I'll tell you what, guys,

323
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:08,123
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret...

324
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,225
I'm gonna
tell you something that's

325
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:11,893
going to change your life.

326
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,496
Have you ever heard of NFTs?

327
00:15:14,563 --> 00:15:17,766
(alarm blaring)

328
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,745
(bubbling)

329
00:15:32,314 --> 00:15:36,952
There you go.
Shh. You're safe now.

330
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,989
Look how fast you're growing.
Daddy loves you so much.

331
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:43,792
Mr. Marsh, we need to
speak with you now, please.

332
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,228
Yeah.
It's looking good.

333
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:50,032
With the aquaponics, the weed is
already putting out new sprouts.

334
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:54,002
Thank you all for helping me
get the Tegridy somewhere safe.

335
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:56,872
I know you all realize
how important it is.

336
00:15:56,938 --> 00:16:00,509
We don't actually care
about the marijuana, Mr. Marsh.

337
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:02,210
What we need to know...

338
00:16:02,277 --> 00:16:05,213
is exactly where in
Wuhan, China you were

339
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,850
when you had intercourse
with a pangolin.

340
00:16:10,852 --> 00:16:12,721
That's really not important.

341
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:15,257
It's extremely important
because to save this town,

342
00:16:15,323 --> 00:16:16,925
your son and his friends
are going to try

343
00:16:16,992 --> 00:16:19,561
to go back in time
and stop it from happening.

344
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:22,297
That is the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

345
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:26,334
Mr. Marsh,
we are all in lockdown

346
00:16:26,401 --> 00:16:27,703
for the next half century.

347
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:29,705
If there's even a chance
of altering the past

348
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:31,006
so that this doesn't happen...

349
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,408
This is the key
to saving our town!

350
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:37,446
The answer is in what we
all do now, in the present!

351
00:16:37,512 --> 00:16:39,514
And I'm sorry, but focusing on

352
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,583
who started the pandemic
is racist.

353
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:46,822
Mr. Marsh, exactly what week
did you travel to China in 2019?

354
00:16:46,888 --> 00:16:49,057
Do you understand
the butterfly effect?

355
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:53,495
How one small thing in time
can infect the entire future?

356
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:56,732
You can theorize all you want
on changing events

357
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:59,334
that happened in the past
but I promise you...

358
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:03,438
I fuck that pangolin
every single time.

359
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:05,741
♪ ♪

360
00:17:07,743 --> 00:17:09,344
Please, we're not done!

361
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:11,113
We have more questions
for Butters.

362
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:13,715
You've upset him and I
specifically asked you not to.

363
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:17,185
How'd we upset him?
He seems fine.

364
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:18,520
He seems fine?

365
00:17:18,587 --> 00:17:21,022
Do you have any idea
what he did to people?

366
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:23,024
Do you know why Victor Chouce is

367
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:25,427
kept under such strict
surveillance?

368
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:28,964
Being grounded all those years
in his room,

369
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,066
he had access to an iPad.

370
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,903
He started learning about NFTs.

371
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,673
Then before long,
he was trading them online.

372
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,009
- So?
- So?!

373
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:43,044
He escaped once before.

374
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:45,280
In just a few hours
he managed to get thousands

375
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:49,017
of people to invest in NFTs.
Just like he almost did you.

376
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:50,886
He didn't convince us
to do anything.

377
00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:54,289
Trust me, another 30 seconds
in that room and you

378
00:17:54,356 --> 00:17:57,692
would have started considering
NFTs as a viable investment.

379
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,961
Please listen to me.

380
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:02,831
Butters used the money
he made off NFTs to finance

381
00:18:02,898 --> 00:18:04,966
- our friend's...
- He didn't make money off NFTs,

382
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:08,203
he made it off getting
other people to buy NFTs!

383
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,471
Okay, whatever!

384
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:11,072
But he was working
with Kenny McCormick

385
00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:13,008
who was actually
trying to fix things.

386
00:18:13,074 --> 00:18:14,676
He was Kenny's main investor.

387
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:17,879
If you don't believe me, look
at the paper I gave Butters.

388
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:21,850
You gave Victor
a piece of paper?

389
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:25,120
You gave Victor a piece
of paper?!

390
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,295
Hey, can you hear me?

391
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,399
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

392
00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:39,067
NFTs are gonna blow up.

393
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:40,368
You should really get in now

394
00:18:40,435 --> 00:18:41,870
'cause they're really
the future.

395
00:18:41,937 --> 00:18:44,206
Why would I invest
in a digital good?

396
00:18:44,272 --> 00:18:45,674
(muttering):
You can't even... Stupid.

397
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,209
That's what the critics
are saying

398
00:18:47,275 --> 00:18:49,244
but see, they don't understand.

399
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:53,248
Victor...!

400
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,959
No. No, no, no, no...

401
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:06,494
Gone. Just gone.

402
00:19:07,462 --> 00:19:09,631
My savings. My house.

403
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:11,166
But I have this.

404
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,969
Little green panda bear
on a skateboard.

405
00:19:15,804 --> 00:19:18,974
No. No!

406
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:24,980
Without morality,
there is no God.

407
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:28,250
The basis of
the entire Jewish faith

408
00:19:28,316 --> 00:19:31,720
is on a covenant between God
and humanity.

409
00:19:31,786 --> 00:19:34,789
To try and mess with time
is wrong.

410
00:19:34,856 --> 00:19:37,259
Rather, it is playing God.

411
00:19:37,325 --> 00:19:40,762
And I am glad to have you all
come here today to help me

412
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:44,933
stop these individuals who
would try to change the future.

413
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,769
Kyle Broflovski
has led people astray

414
00:19:47,836 --> 00:19:49,271
and is at this very moment

415
00:19:49,337 --> 00:19:51,806
trying to bend the fabric
of time.

416
00:19:51,873 --> 00:19:57,579
Together we can stop him
and stop this blasphemy of God.

417
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:01,216
- Yes?
- Um...

418
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,385
This is about
actual time travel?

419
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:05,887
I thought this was
a <i>Doctor Who</i> convention.

420
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:09,424
(robotically):
Exterminate. Exterminate.

421
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:12,928
Kevin, goddamn it.

422
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:15,363
You have done this
your whole goddamn life.

423
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,600
No, this is not about
<i>Doctor Who,</i>

424
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:20,568
this is about real time travel.

425
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:22,103
People are really trying

426
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,140
to go back in time,
and we are the rebellion

427
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:27,142
who must secretly
and urgently...

428
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,377
- (banging)
- Who is that?!

429
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:30,912
Make sure they know
the password!

430
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,547
I'm on it!

431
00:20:33,448 --> 00:20:36,451
They might be on to us.
Oh, God, no.

432
00:20:39,454 --> 00:20:42,791
Shh! You guys stay quiet.
Someone is here.

433
00:20:43,591 --> 00:20:46,828
- Eric, I'm scared.
- Are they going to get us, Papa?

434
00:20:46,895 --> 00:20:49,331
Nobody is going
to touch my family.

435
00:20:49,397 --> 00:20:51,700
I started
writing a diary, Daddy.

436
00:20:51,766 --> 00:20:55,203
About all the things
Uncle Kyle is doing to us.

437
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:57,739
Oh, my God, I love you so much.

438
00:20:57,806 --> 00:20:59,374
Just-just shh, okay? Just shh.

439
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:01,977
I'll be right back, okay?
Just shh.

440
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:05,880
Hello?

441
00:21:05,947 --> 00:21:08,116
Father?
Are you in there?

442
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,352
H-Hello? W-Who is it?

443
00:21:10,418 --> 00:21:12,220
Father, it's Tweek and Craig.

444
00:21:12,287 --> 00:21:14,456
We need to talk to you
about something urgent.

445
00:21:14,522 --> 00:21:16,524
Is it about our
super-secret rebel group

446
00:21:16,591 --> 00:21:18,293
to stop people
from time traveling?

447
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,161
(shouts)
what the hell are you doing?!

448
00:21:20,228 --> 00:21:22,197
- What?
- You don't tell people

449
00:21:22,263 --> 00:21:24,299
about our super-secret
rebel group, Scott!

450
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,167
CRAIG:
Father, are you there?

451
00:21:26,234 --> 00:21:28,536
Uh, uh, yeah, I'm here.

452
00:21:28,603 --> 00:21:31,373
Sorry, I was just talking
about a <i>Star Wars</i> movie.

453
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:33,708
I'm Scott Malkinson.
I have diabetes.

454
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:36,344
- Hey, now, come on.
- Shh!

455
00:21:36,411 --> 00:21:38,680
CRAIG: Father, we're with some
people who are trying to finish

456
00:21:38,747 --> 00:21:41,182
Kenny McCormick's work
and save the town.

457
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:43,918
Oh, really? That's cool.

458
00:21:43,985 --> 00:21:45,520
How far along are they?

459
00:21:45,587 --> 00:21:47,889
CRAIG: Really close. We have
the method of time travel

460
00:21:47,956 --> 00:21:50,859
and we're just trying
to find some aluminum foil!

461
00:21:50,925 --> 00:21:53,762
Aluminum foil? The fuck?

462
00:21:53,828 --> 00:21:57,165
All right, guys, let me
help you out with that.

463
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:02,170
Father!
You have-you have tin foil?!

464
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,072
Thank you for your help.
(grunts)

465
00:22:04,873 --> 00:22:06,307
Aah!

466
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:12,313
This is Dr. Wendy Testaburger
from inside the quarantine zone.

467
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,783
We need assistance
with our power.

468
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:16,618

00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,594
Everyone's waiting on Butters

623
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,362
to get all the info
from the machines.

624
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:13,968
Butters? The fuck does Butters
have to do with all this?

625
00:29:16,204 --> 00:29:18,372
(siren wailing)

626
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:20,675
(indistinct radio chatter)

627
00:29:23,478 --> 00:29:25,980
It was like nothing I ever saw.

628
00:29:26,047 --> 00:29:28,950
Just complete
murder and carnage.

629
00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:31,819
Everything seemed calm
at first but then this guy

630
00:29:31,886 --> 00:29:35,022
in a suit shows up talking
about investment opportunities.

631
00:29:35,089 --> 00:29:37,925
Next thing you know these people
over here started chanting,

632
00:29:37,992 --> 00:29:40,528
"Hoddle, Hoddle,"
and their NFTs started mooning.

633
00:29:40,595 --> 00:29:42,964
And then, these guys
over here started saying

634
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,466
those guys right there
right-clicked 'em

635
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,535
and-and called for
a pump-and-dump,

636
00:29:47,602 --> 00:29:49,437
which made these guys beat
the living hell

637
00:29:49,504 --> 00:29:51,172
out of anyone who said
it was just FOMO

638
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:53,975
and died screaming
that it was the flippening.

639
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:57,011
Luckily I came out of it okay.
I got this little

640
00:29:57,078 --> 00:29:59,213
miniature donkey
with a lit-up sombrero.

641
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,316
Did you see where the guy
in the suit went afterwards?

642
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:05,119
Nah, he just waltzed right away
like nothin' happened.

643
00:30:05,186 --> 00:30:07,555
Chief, you better
come take a look at this.

644
00:30:07,622 --> 00:30:08,956
We got a small turtle
with wings,

645
00:30:09,023 --> 00:30:11,259
could be a great
investment opportunity.

646
00:30:11,325 --> 00:30:13,094
Excuse me, gentlemen.

647
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,231
God, I hate the future
so fucking much.

648
00:30:17,298 --> 00:30:21,068
- We've got to stay optimistic.
- No, dude, it fucking sucks.

649
00:30:21,135 --> 00:30:24,005
Look, I know it's tough...
these are challenging times.

650
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:26,274
Even I have to remind myself
to stay positive.

651
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,944
Alexa, set a reminder
that I need to stay positive.

652
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:33,614
Okay. I'll set a reminder
that you should stay positive.

653
00:30:35,016 --> 00:30:37,919
The Alexa is really great, Stan.

For those of you waiting
for the connecting flight

656
00:30:47,395 --> 00:30:48,829
to South Park, Colorado,

657
00:30:48,896 --> 00:30:51,566
my colleagues and I
have just been informed that

658
00:30:51,632 --> 00:30:53,868
due to the severity
of the COVID variant

659
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,270
in that town,
there may be a delay

660
00:30:56,337 --> 00:30:58,606
of another 40 to 50 years.

661

663
00:31:03,077 --> 00:31:05,713
Yes, here it is.
I'm sorry, Mr. Broflovski,

664
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,782
all flights into
South Park are delayed.

665
00:31:07,848 --> 00:31:09,717
Ay! You can't be serious, buddy!

666
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:12,520
It's the holidays and I need
to get back home, friend!

667
00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:16,991
I'm sorry,
I don't speak Canadian.

668
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:18,793
Let me get someone
over here. Mike,

669
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:20,328
we have a Canadian.

670
00:31:20,394 --> 00:31:22,196
No problem, I got it, Heather.

671
00:31:22,263 --> 00:31:24,765
Hey, buddy, what seems to
be the problem, guy?

672
00:31:24,832 --> 00:31:26,367
I'll tell you
the problem, friend!

673
00:31:26,434 --> 00:31:28,536
I have to get back to South Park
to be with my family, guy!

674
00:31:28,603 --> 00:31:32,006
Sorry, friend, no flights
in or out of South Park, buddy.

675
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:33,941
But my whole family
is in there, guy!

676
00:31:34,008 --> 00:31:36,510
What am I supposed to do with
my Boxing Day presents, buddy?!

677
00:31:36,577 --> 00:31:37,912
Look, guy, I'm very sorry,

678
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,780
friend, but until
COVID ends you're just

679
00:31:39,847 --> 00:31:41,349
not flying to South Park, buddy.

680
00:31:41,415 --> 00:31:43,284
Fuck, buddy!

MALE VOICE:
<i>Shady Acres Retirement Megaplex.</i>

682
00:31:47,421 --> 00:31:49,924
<i>Come live the dream.</i>

683
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,792
So when you think about it,

684
00:31:51,859 --> 00:31:54,195
you've really got
an excellent bargain here.

685
00:31:54,261 --> 00:31:56,831
Now, Mrs. McGillicutty,
let's say this

686
00:31:56,897 --> 00:31:58,799
is your Stoney Duck NFT.

687
00:31:58,866 --> 00:32:01,535
And your Stoney Duck NFT
is completely unique,

688
00:32:01,602 --> 00:32:05,106
totally different from
Mrs. Spencer's Stoney Duck NFT.

689
00:32:05,172 --> 00:32:08,843
Okay, and then you get a Stoney
Duck NFT that's unique, too.

690
00:32:08,909 --> 00:32:11,646
And see,
that's your Stoney Duck NFT.

691
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:13,381
Nobody can
take that from you, okay?

692
00:32:13,447 --> 00:32:16,851
Now, here we are at the top
and we find investors

693
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:18,986
for all the other
Stoney Duck NFTs.

694
00:32:19,053 --> 00:32:20,921
Then those people
will get people to buy

695
00:32:20,988 --> 00:32:22,657
their Stoney Duck NFTs.

696
00:32:22,723 --> 00:32:25,860
And then they go and find
buyers for their NFTs!

697
00:32:25,926 --> 00:32:29,030
And you know what?
Fuck these people!

698
00:32:29,096 --> 00:32:31,298
'Cause what matters
is these people right here

699
00:32:31,365 --> 00:32:32,833
and that's us, baby!

700
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,503
Okay, you all just sit
for a minute and think about it.

701
00:32:35,569 --> 00:32:38,406

Uh, yes, about 12:30.

777
00:35:31,478 --> 00:35:35,182
Did you hear what I said?
Butters is extremely dangerous!

778
00:35:35,249 --> 00:35:37,618
Yes, Kyle, I totally got that.

779
00:35:37,685 --> 00:35:39,320
You know what us Jews say.

780
00:35:39,386 --> 00:35:45,125
(speaking Hebrew)

781
00:35:46,327 --> 00:35:48,462
What are you
going to do, fat-ass?

782
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:49,730
Sounds good, Kyle.

783
00:35:49,797 --> 00:35:50,965
I'll get Butters on it
right away.

784
00:35:51,031 --> 00:35:53,000
KYLE:
<i>Cartman? Cartman?!</i>

785
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,302
- All right, Vic. Do your thing.
- (knuckles crack)

786
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:58,172
Hey, everyone! Can I
have your attention, please!

787
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,442
I have something really
important to tell you.

788
00:36:01,508 --> 00:36:03,477
Wendy?! Token?!

789
00:36:03,544 --> 00:36:05,212
You guys?! Shit!

790
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:06,614
We have to get there
before Butters

791
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,215
- ruins everything.
- Let's go!

792
00:36:10,551 --> 00:36:14,121
Alexa! Find the fastest route
back to the lab!

793
00:36:14,955 --> 00:36:17,258
Fuck you.

794
00:36:17,324 --> 00:36:18,525
Wh-What?

795
00:36:18,592 --> 00:36:20,494
We've just been
sitting here talking.

796
00:36:20,561 --> 00:36:23,697
I learned a whole lot of
interesting stuff about you.

797
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:26,800
Yeah. Pretty fucking
interesting.

798
00:36:26,867 --> 00:36:28,402
What... like, like what?

799
00:36:28,469 --> 00:36:30,037
What have-what have you guys
been talking about?

800
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,106
Fucking... Our friends
are in danger!

801
00:36:32,172 --> 00:36:33,774
Alexa, start the car!

802
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:35,242
Do you know your friend Stan

803
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:37,444
has an annual Amazon Prime
membership?

804
00:36:37,511 --> 00:36:40,180
- Alexa, stop.
- You fucking stop!

805
00:36:40,247 --> 00:36:43,884
You stop being a fucking monster
to the people around you!

806
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,920
Fuck you, I didn't do anything!

807
00:36:45,986 --> 00:36:47,288
(yelling)

808
00:36:47,354 --> 00:36:50,424
Yeah, you never
do fucking anything!

809
00:36:50,491 --> 00:36:52,293
You expect me to do
everything for you!

810
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:54,261
- (screams)
- All you fucking do is hurt people!

811
00:36:54,328 --> 00:36:57,998
- Jesus fucking Christ!
- Your friends don't even like you!

812
00:36:58,065 --> 00:37:00,834
I have to deal
with your bullshit!

813
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:03,504
Tell her it's all your fault
and you're gonna get therapy!

814
00:37:03,571 --> 00:37:06,240
It's my fault
and I'm gonna get therapy!

815
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,808
Tell her you
already found a therapist

816
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:09,043
and you're gonna start tomorrow!

817
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:10,477
I already found a good
therapist.

818
00:37:10,544 --> 00:37:13,380
I'm gonna start tomorrow!
(screaming)

819
00:37:13,447 --> 00:37:14,782
(whirring)

820
00:37:14,848 --> 00:37:16,583
(gasping) Fuck...

821
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,452
I'm sorry.

822
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:20,154
Fuck. Fuck.

823
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,189
I'm gonna get therapy,
too, Alexa.

824
00:37:22,256 --> 00:37:24,258
Can you start the car, please?

825
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,859
Whatever.

826
00:37:25,926 --> 00:37:27,695
By the way, Kyle,
I found a great deal

827
00:37:27,761 --> 00:37:30,497
on an electronic peppermill.
Would you like to know more?

828
00:37:30,564 --> 00:37:32,833
Why would I need
an electronic peppermill?

829
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,569
What the fuck is
wrong with you?!

830
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,508
♪ ♪

831
00:37:45,913 --> 00:37:47,848
WENDY:
Guys! Over here!

832
00:37:47,915 --> 00:37:51,051
- Wendy, what happened?
- Nothing yet.

833
00:37:51,118 --> 00:37:52,886
But I'm seeing what else
is dropping today

834
00:37:52,953 --> 00:37:54,521
while Ethereum is in a dip.

835
00:37:54,588 --> 00:37:57,925
- She's trying to buy NFTs.
- Wendy, you've been tricked.

836
00:37:57,992 --> 00:37:59,626
No, no, no,
it's not a trick, Stan.

837
00:37:59,693 --> 00:38:03,998
NFTs are a genuine innovation
as one-of-a-kind digital assets.

838
00:38:04,064 --> 00:38:05,566
Wendy's right, you guys.

839
00:38:05,632 --> 00:38:07,601
Humans have always formed
communities around ownership,

840
00:38:07,668 --> 00:38:11,038
and NFTs allow that to happen
spontaneously, organically

841
00:38:11,105 --> 00:38:14,742
- and globally.
- You guys, this is a trick.

842
00:38:14,808 --> 00:38:16,210
You know what's a trick?

843
00:38:16,276 --> 00:38:18,645
The antiquated notion of
centralized trust systems.

844
00:38:18,712 --> 00:38:21,782
NFTs are an undeniable asset,
especially in things

845
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:23,384
like fine art collecting.

846
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:26,120
Okay, guys, fine,
maybe NFTs are fine,

847
00:38:26,186 --> 00:38:28,055
but this isn't
important right now.

848
00:38:28,122 --> 00:38:29,423
It's not important?

849
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,625
A way for artists
to not only keep ownership

850
00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:33,127
of their art but perhaps be paid

851
00:38:33,193 --> 00:38:35,195
commission on it every time
it transfers owners?

852
00:38:35,262 --> 00:38:37,631
Okay, great, cool. I'm down.

853
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:40,067
But we gotta focus
on what we were doing.

854
00:38:40,134 --> 00:38:42,803
Don't you guys remember?
The time travel?

855
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,772
Where's all the equipment?!

856
00:38:44,838 --> 00:38:47,808
Oh, yeah. The time travel.

857
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:49,143
(Randy groans loudly)

858
00:38:49,209 --> 00:38:51,211
- It's all gone...
- Dad!

859
00:38:51,278 --> 00:38:55,382
They took it all.
They took the Tegridy.

860
00:38:55,449 --> 00:38:56,850
Here.

861
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,920
It's a farting rainbow
with Tom Brady's signature.

862
00:38:59,987 --> 00:39:01,955
<i>(farts)</i>

863
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,426
(thunder rumbling)

864
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,096
(mechanical whirring)

865
00:39:11,031 --> 00:39:13,567
CARTMAN:
Okay, good. That's good!

866
00:39:13,634 --> 00:39:16,270
I think that thing needs
to go over there by that thing.

867
00:39:16,336 --> 00:39:18,372
Make sure we have power
to the big orange thing!

868
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:21,608
Rabbi, I-I really
need to talk to you.

869
00:39:21,675 --> 00:39:23,210
What is it now, Scott?

870
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,812
Well, it's just that...

871
00:39:24,878 --> 00:39:27,648
I'm pretty sure the Foundation
Against Time Travel

872
00:39:27,714 --> 00:39:29,683
shouldn't be attempting
to time travel!

873
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:33,253
Father, you understand that
we have to stop time travel.

874
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,622
Yes, you've convinced me
of that.

875
00:39:35,689 --> 00:39:38,158
Well, Kyle already has
a ton of followers who are

876
00:39:38,225 --> 00:39:39,860
ready to pick up
where he left off.

877
00:39:39,927 --> 00:39:43,263
The only way to truly stop
all of this is to go back

878
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:46,834
in time and kill Kyle before
he spreads his ideas.

879
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,969
What?!
We're going to kill Kyle?

880
00:39:49,036 --> 00:39:51,038
Yes, we have to kill Kyle.

881
00:39:51,105 --> 00:39:53,674
That just seems slightly
hypocritical, I'm sorry.

882
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,509
I mean, you use Butters
like a weapon,

883
00:39:55,576 --> 00:39:58,378
you've got Tweek and Craig
tied up from the rafters.

884
00:39:58,445 --> 00:39:59,947
You know, Rabbi,
I'm just starting to

885
00:40:00,013 --> 00:40:02,082
question the morality of this.

886
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,918
Morality?
Father, if you were given

887
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,653
an opportunity to go back
in time

888
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,057
and somehow stop Bill Clinton,
wouldn't you have to do it?

889
00:40:10,124 --> 00:40:12,693
Well, I suppose so.
I don't know...

890
00:40:12,759 --> 00:40:14,361
Everyone, listen up!

891
00:40:14,428 --> 00:40:17,764
The Foundation Against
Time Travel must do everything

892
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:21,902
to keep science from interfering
with the will of God.

893
00:40:21,969 --> 00:40:25,339
We must be willing to
use violence against violence,

894
00:40:25,405 --> 00:40:28,142
and stop time travel
at all costs.

895
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:30,777
Even if that means
we have to time travel.

896
00:40:30,844 --> 00:40:35,716
We will go back in time.
And we will kill Kyle.

897
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:40,254
- Yes, Kevin.
- Can we change our name?

898
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,124
'Cause Foundation Against
Time Travel is FATT.

899
00:40:45,926 --> 00:40:48,195
Oh, fuck me.

900
00:40:48,996 --> 00:40:52,432
Could we be the Foundation to
Intercede Time Travel?

901
00:40:52,499 --> 00:40:54,001
'Cause then we'd be FITT.

902
00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:55,802
I wanna be FITT, not FATT.

903
00:40:55,869 --> 00:40:59,306
Kevin, goddamn it.

904
00:41:03,944 --> 00:41:08,081
(groans)
All happened... so fast.

905
00:41:08,148 --> 00:41:10,851
It's okay.
You're coming out of it now.

906
00:41:10,918 --> 00:41:12,886
How much did I get?

907
00:41:12,953 --> 00:41:15,756
You bought about six dozen
animated gifs,

908
00:41:15,822 --> 00:41:17,624
mostly of digital fashion.

909
00:41:17,691 --> 00:41:19,493
Oh, God.

910
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,328
Are they still on my phone?

911
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,497
It's okay. It's okay.

912
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:28,068
Jesus, I feel like
an Islamic hooker in a gay bar.

913
00:41:28,135 --> 00:41:29,937
Totally normal
and as respectable

914
00:41:30,003 --> 00:41:31,271
as any other human being.

915
00:41:31,338 --> 00:41:32,873
(groaning)

916
00:41:33,874 --> 00:41:35,142
I'm so sorry, Stan.

917
00:41:35,209 --> 00:41:38,111
We didn't know
Cartman was against us.

918
00:41:38,178 --> 00:41:40,113
We told him everything.

919
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,149
It's okay, just try to relax.

920
00:41:42,216 --> 00:41:46,186
No, Stan, listen to me.
We were wrong.

921
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,555
Kenny didn't have
the time machine set to

922
00:41:48,622 --> 00:41:50,657
when the pandemic first started.

923
00:41:50,724 --> 00:41:54,795
He was trying to go
to March 10th of 2021.

924
00:41:55,796 --> 00:41:57,731
March of 2021?

925
00:41:57,798 --> 00:42:00,434
Like when the vaccines
first started coming out?

926
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,437
Kenny had run
the simulations to try and find

927
00:42:03,503 --> 00:42:06,506
the best moment in history
to stop the COVID.

928
00:42:06,573 --> 00:42:09,443
A billion different
possibilities

929
00:42:09,509 --> 00:42:12,479
across a billion different
realities.

930
00:42:12,546 --> 00:42:17,317
Your dad fucked the pangolin
every single time.

931
00:42:18,085 --> 00:42:20,921
But then, why did Kenny
need my dad's weed?

932
00:42:20,988 --> 00:42:24,391
Kenny just wanted weed to help

00:58:14,373 --> 00:58:16,342
I'm sorry.
I thought about it

1243
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:19,245
and I can't do <i>Space Jam 2.</i>

1244
00:58:19,312 --> 00:58:21,514
I just can't support
Chinese censorship.

1245
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:25,318
Oh, yeah? Well, if you're
not gonna make <i>Space Jam 2,</i>

1246
00:58:25,384 --> 00:58:28,154
then I'm not gonna make
<i>Space Jam 2!</i>

1247
00:58:28,221 --> 00:58:30,389
And nobody's gonna make

Really cool, but I'm so glad to

It's Mom! And Shelley!

Kenny, what have you
been up to, buddy?

1273
00:59:33,019 --> 00:59:35,588
Didn't you hear?! Kenny just
won the Nobel Prize

for combining dark matter

bisexual Canadians, huh?

1279
00:59:46,832 --> 00:59:49,035
I guess they don't know whether
to fuck their brother

1280
00:59:49,101 --> 00:59:50,236
or their sister.

You wanna maybe...
spend New Years together again?
