2
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:03,665
Good, that was lovely.
Moll, I need more from you.

3
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,999
Can we take it from the beginning?

4
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,332
And...

5
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,915
<i>I was obsessed by killer whales
when I was a kid.</i>

6
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,999
<i>They always seem to be smiling.</i>

7
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,665
<i>You know, they travel
a hundred miles a day in the ocean.</i>

8
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,665
<i>But in captivity, their sound waves
bounce off the walls</i>

9
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,124
<i>and they become deaf and dumb.</i>

10
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,249
<i>Some even go insane.</i>

11
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,624
<i>I read about one whale
that broke all its teeth</i>

12
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,540
<i>trying to break free.</i>

13
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,457
<i>Just got too much for him.</i>

14
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,957
<i>He didn't want to smile any more.</i>

15
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,624
I'll have a pint of Heineken
and a glass of red wine, please.

16
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,332
And a packet of crisps.

17
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,374
- Hey, Cliff.
- Hey.

18
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,749
- How are you?
- Yeah, good. You?

19
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,915
- Yeah, no, I'm good, I'm good.
- Good.

20
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,415
Just, uh, hang on a sec.

21
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,749
Oh. Cliff, you didn't have to, honestly.

22
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,415
- Please. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

23
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,332
Oh.

24
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,332
They give you one of these
when you enter the force.

25
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,082
Wow. Thank you.

26
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,040
- That's fine.
- Um...

27
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,290
It just goes, uh,

28
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,207
- just anywhere. Yeah, anywhere.
- Anywhere, yeah.

29
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,582
- I think I'm...
- Just, uh... Sorry. May I?

30
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:43,999
It's okay.

31
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,165
You're not really supposed to give these away

32
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,499
but you can keep a secret.

33
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,582
- Hiya!
- Oh. Better say hi.

34
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:55,749
No, of course.

35
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,665
- Thanks for coming.
- Not at all.

36
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,832
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

37
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,415
And help yourself to more drinks

38
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,749
and there's plenty of food as well
if you want anything to eat.

39
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,415
Okay. Sure.

40
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,040
Oh. Who gave you that?

41
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,082
Oh, um, Clifford.

42
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,957
Oh. How sweet.

43
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,207
I'd like to make a toast

44
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,499
to someone very special,

45
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,582
someone we can all rely on.
Happy birthday, sis.

46
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,207
- To Moll!
- To Moll!

47
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,540
And, uh, while she's got you lot
to be quiet for the moment...

48
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:35,749
Uh, we would like to take
this opportunity to announce

49
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,957
Spence and me are expecting twins.

50
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,915
Get the champagne, sweetheart,
there's a case in the garage.

51
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,207
There's champagne?

52
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:50,340
Don't pull that face.
She's having twins, Moll.

53
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,082
Come on! Over here!

54
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,232
What are you doing?

55
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,499
I frightened you.

56
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,415
Hang on, I've got to go home.

57
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,832
Oh, come on, I spent the whole night
buying you drinks.

58
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,165
I know, I... I've got to get home
and look after my dad.

59
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,165
He'll be all right. Just a little kiss.

60
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,707
Don't do that, please.

61
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:50,999
Why?

62
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:52,957
Don't.

63
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,332
Wait, I... I need to get home.

64
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,624
I know you want it.

65
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:00,707
Don't... Don't.

66
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:01,915
- Just a little kiss.
- Don't... Don't.

67
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,207
- I don't... I need to get home.
- Just a little kiss, come on.

68
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,832
- Don't! Please don't do that!
- Hey!

69
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,124
What are you doing, you freak?

70
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,040
What?

71
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,124
Do you know how to use that?

72
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:04,665
You're wounded.

73
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,624
Well, I can fix that.

74
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:01,940
Get in.

75
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,265
No, thanks.

76
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,082
Doesn't hurt?

77
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,165
You have blood on your hands.

78
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,124
Isn't that illegal?

79
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,457
Can you keep a secret?

80
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,790
Then, I'm okay.

81
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,957
Just missing a section on humans.

82
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:44,915
Shit.

83
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,457
You don't have to tell them what happened.

84
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,499
- You sure?
- Yeah. I don't want any trouble.

85
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,249
- Morning, officer.
- Seat belt.

86
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,582
Yeah, sorry. We just got on the road.

87
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:07,915
Up early.

88
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,832
You mean late, we've been at the Wipeout.

89
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:16,957
The, um, the DJ was great,
we couldn't stop dancing.

90
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,749
You can breathalyse me.

91
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:42,165
Incidentally, I'm an amazing dancer.

92
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,874
Really?

93
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,040
And what do you do?

94
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,415
Work with my hands, I'm a craftsman.

95
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,499
You?

96
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,207
Uh, I'm a historical guide.

97
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:57,999
Not the granny wagons?

98
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,665
It's only temporary.

99
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,665
Nice place.

100
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,707
Yeah, it's... It's my parents'.

101
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,165
I'm just helping look after my dad.

102
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,707
Someone's birthday?

103
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,457
Mine, actually.

104
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,124
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

105
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,999
Uh, thanks for the, um, lift.

106
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:22,749
You're safe.

107
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,082
I was worried sick. What happened?

108
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,749
- I, um...
- Come here.

109
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,124
I won't bite.

110
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,665
I felt funny, so I went for a walk.

111
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,957
And I fell asleep on the beach.

112
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,790
- I thought we were best friends.
- We are.

113
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,874
Then don't lie to me.

114
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,290
I just wanted to go dancing.

115
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,332
I put all that effort into making it special

116
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,999
and you wanted to go dancing.

117
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,540
I'm so sorry.

118
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,915
Mum, it was irresponsible and thoughtless.

119
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,582
You've come so far, Moll.

120
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,249
I worry when things like this happen.

121
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,582
It won't happen again, I promise.

122
00:17:14,591 --> 00:17:16,149
It was your birthday.

123
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,665
We'll let this one go.

124
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,332
Eat your cake.

125
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,040
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen

126
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,415
and welcome to Tantivy Blue Coach Tours.

127
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,457
My name's Moll
and I will be your hostess for the day.

128
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,082
Um, just to give you a rough outline

129
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,290
of what you can expect from today's travels.

130
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,949
Firstly, um, we will...

131
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,749
What are you doing here?

132
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,249
Just wanted to check how you're doing.

133
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,665
Yeah, I'm... I'm good, thank you.

134
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,290
Here, birthday present.

135
00:18:57,223 --> 00:18:58,957
Thank you.

136
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:10,082
It's my... My mum.

137
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,082
- Hilary.
- Pascal Renouf.

138
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,290
How do you do?

139
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,957
Your dad needs you, sweetheart.

140
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,749
Have a pleasant evening.

141
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,915
- Who was that?
- No one. Just...

142
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,999
He gave me a lift the other night.

143
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,915
Could smell him a mile off.

144
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,665
My name's Moll.

145
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,415
What are you doing Saturday?

146
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,582
There's a few odd jobs around the house.

147
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:06,707
Uh, a bench needs fixing
and some patio slabs.

148
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,499
And you said you were good with your hands.

149
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:12,999
Okay, Saturday.

150
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,082
What homework have you got tonight, Jade?

151
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,707
Usual. Bit of maths, bit of science.

152
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,374
Hey.

153
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:45,082
- How was the game?
- Cock-up. Lost 50 quid.

154
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:49,582
Mum, uh, can Jade stay here tonight?

155
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,207
I've got a friend coming over.

156
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,374
I've got a fête meeting, sweetheart.

157
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,749
Moll can look after her.

158
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,624
<i>Everyone is hoping for the best.</i>

159
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,374
<i>But there is of course speculation
that Melissa's disappearance</i>

160
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:03,374
<i>is connected to the unsolved
abduction and murder</i>

161
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,999
<i>of three other girls
over the past four years.</i>

162
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:12,290
<i>It's been 22 hours since
I saw Melissa tucked up in bed.</i>

163
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:19,749
<i>And if anyone can help us to find her...</i>

164
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,124
<i>We miss her very, very much.</i>

165
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,374
- Harrison, turn it off.
- <i>We miss...</i>

166
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,915
How was the game?

167
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,499
It was great.

168
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:16,207
Whose house is this?

169
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,457
It's ours, Dad.

170
00:23:51,675 --> 00:23:53,424
That's everything.

171
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:12,665
Thanks.

172
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:16,249
You've got, um...

173
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:34,040
You want to go for a ride?

174
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:19,790
Come on.

175
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:38,624
I got you.

176
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:18,207
You're unbelievable, Moll.

177
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:20,790
What? What did I do?

178
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:23,082
- Oh, come on!
- Harry.

179
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,499
You left Jade alone.

180
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:29,582
With Dad.

181
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:31,332
He doesn't know what the fuck's going on!

182
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:34,082
- Well, you were supposed to be here.
- Moll.

183
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:37,749
Sit down.

184
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:50,374
Where were you?

185
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:52,999
I just needed to pop into work.

186
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:55,124
You're lying again.

187
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:58,290
You went off with that Pascal, didn't you?

188
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:00,165
We just went for a drive.

189
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:02,999
Sophie Healey's daughter is missing

190
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:05,207
there's a killer stalking this island

191
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:08,457
and you abandoned her
because you wanted to go for a drive?

192
00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:10,124
She's family!

193
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,415
Families are supposed to
look after each other.

194
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,749
But the only thing that seems
to matter in your world is you.

195
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:15,832
That's not true.

196
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:18,624
So you must be plain stupid. Is that it?

197
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:21,374
You don't know the difference
between right and wrong?

198
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,999
I know the difference.

199
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:26,332
So you're selfish?

200
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,457
Are you going to apologise to your niece?

201
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:35,540
- It's okay...
- Be quiet!

202
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:40,790
I'm sorry.

203
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:43,207
For?

204
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:47,582
I'm sorry for being selfish.

205
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:54,665
I'm sorry for being selfish
and for being a liar.

206
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:09,165
Okay, that's enough.

207
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,165
Let's be friends again, hmm?

208
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,457
You need to pick your daughter up on time.

209
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,207
Moll around?

210
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:51,082
She's busy this evening.
Maybe I can get her to call you...

211
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:52,165
Hey.

212
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,874
So I was just off down the pub,
wondered if you wanted to get shit-faced?

213
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:01,124
- We're about to have dinner.
- There's plenty.

214
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:05,082
I never get the measurements right.

215
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,124
Well, I never turn down food.

216
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:30,999
- Is Renouf a Jersey name?
- Yeah.

217
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:33,082
I'm about as local as they come.

218
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:35,499
My ancestors were Norman noblemen.

219
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,165
They owned a lot of the west coast

220
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,999
probably the land we're on right now.

221
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:43,582
Where are you from? You're on my land.

222
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:46,707
Who are your parents?

223
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,249
Victor and Maude.

224
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:53,332
And what do they do?

225
00:30:54,458 --> 00:30:56,374
Passed away.

226
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:58,207
Oh. I'm sorry.

227
00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:00,332
It's all right. It was a long time ago.

228
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:02,165
What's your take on this maniac?

229
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,249
Can we talk about something else?

230
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:07,332
He might have some native intuition.

231
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:10,957
You know what? I'm with Mum.
Can we talk about something else?

232
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,207
I bet it's that Porco

233
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:13,332
- from L'Etac Farm.
- Hear, hear.

234
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:15,790
- I'm sure of it.
- Sorry about this.

235
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:19,415
It's okay, people often adopt the values
that they're born into.

236
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:23,332
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Just what I said.

237
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:27,915
I just don't think that Moll needs
to apologise on your behalf, that's...

238
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:32,999
Where's Spencer?

239
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:36,332
Geneva. My fiancé is a pilot.

240
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:41,290
Watch your step. Moll's a wild one.

241
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:04,665
- All right, Vic?
- All right, mate?

242
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:14,707
What can I get you?

243
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:17,915
A bottle of Liberation and, um...

244
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,665
I'll have the same, thanks.

245
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:22,207
So...

246
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:24,624
"Wild one"?

247
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:30,207
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

248
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:32,874
You gotta give me something.

249
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:35,874
I hurt someone.

250
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,415
When I was 13, I stabbed a girl.

251
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,582
What?

252
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:47,332
I was bullied at school

253
00:32:47,416 --> 00:32:50,999
and this one day in class,
this girl came at me and I...

254
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:54,915
Well, I can't really remember what happened

255
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,124
but one minute, I'm holding some scissors

256
00:32:58,208 --> 00:33:00,749
and the next, they're sticking out of her.

257
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:03,499
And what happened?

258
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:06,499
I was expelled.

259
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,499
Mum quit her job and schooled me at home.

260
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:17,665
Tried to weed the bad out of me.

261
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:23,665
You're a good person, Moll.

262
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,457
You don't know me.

263
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:30,457
I know that people make mistakes.

264
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:34,415
If you keep carrying that around with you,
you won't be able to stand up straight.

265
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,832
I reckon you're one of those
super-bright home-schooled kids.

266
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:45,551
You can do anything you want.

267
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,249
Yeah. Well, I don't know, maybe.

268
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:53,915
Fuck, country night.

269
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:59,499
Am I going to try and do that?

270
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:31,999
It's a short-cut.

271
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,665
You scared?

272
00:39:19,916 --> 00:39:21,382
It's just here.

273
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:45,665
Christ. One minute the sun's out and...

274
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,915
Now, obviously, you've, uh,
you've seen the news.

275
00:39:55,416 --> 00:39:56,457
Yeah.

276
00:39:56,541 --> 00:39:58,707
I just wanted to ask you a few questions.

277
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:02,707
How long have you known Pascal Renouf?

278
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:07,082
A couple of weeks.

279
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:09,832
And what's the nature of your relationship?

280
00:40:11,916 --> 00:40:13,790
We're lovers.

281
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,124
Uh, this isn't easy but

282
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:23,999
I need to ask about your love life.

283
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,082
Look, Moll, I'm the last person
in the world that wants to ask this

284
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:31,832
but we're dealing with
an extremely dangerous individual.

285
00:40:31,916 --> 00:40:36,874
So it's important for me to know
if there's anything out of the ordinary.

286
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:39,707
It's not ordinary,

287
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:42,749
it's amazing.

288
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:54,344
Melissa Healey went missing
on the night of your birthday.

289
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:58,082
It's important that we get a full picture
of that night so tell me what happened.

290
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:06,124
Um...

291
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:09,290
As you know, there was a barbecue at my house

292
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,624
and I...

293
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:17,124
wasn't enjoying myself.

294
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:21,915
So I went to the Wipeout about 10:00.

295
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:24,540
I met Pascal there

296
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:28,332
and we danced until closing.

297
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:34,457
You going to tell me what this is about?

298
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:41,499
Pascal was on a list of suspects
a few years back.

299
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,249
Now, his stories always checked out
but I was never convinced.

300
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:53,290
How many people were on this list?

301
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:56,249
I can't go into that, Moll.

302
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,540
All right, well, I need to go.

303
00:42:04,541 --> 00:42:06,124
I shouldn't be showing you this.

304
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:11,957
Pascal Renouf.

305
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:14,165
Previous convictions.

306
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:18,082
Vandalism, three cases,
six accounts of dangerous driving

307
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:19,374
two of affray

308
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:22,374
illegal poaching, countless times.

309
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:26,332
At 18, he was sentenced to 12 months

310
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:28,957
for indecent assault on a minor.

311
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:32,082
She was 14.

312
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:39,374
You might want to rethink how amazing he is.

313
00:42:49,291 --> 00:42:50,790
Keep up the good work, Cliff.

314
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:07,124
Well, I think they should just tell you
the truth about it...

315
00:44:08,408 --> 00:44:10,540
You gave me goose bumps.

316
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:13,249
Thanks. We practised enough.

317
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:22,665
So, where you been hiding, then?

318
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:25,915
I just... I've been really busy.

319
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,290
- I called.
- Yeah, I know. I just...

320
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,957
I have a lot on at the moment.

321
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,415
Yeah, well, I'll...

322
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,499
I'll see you around, then, yeah?

323
00:44:38,583 --> 00:44:39,707
Yeah.

324
00:44:57,458 --> 00:44:58,999
That's my girl.

325
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:19,582
Hey.

326
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:22,415
Hey.

327
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:27,332
I thought I'd lost you.

328
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:31,415
Can we talk?

329
00:45:32,541 --> 00:45:34,290
No! No!

330
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,332
- No!
- ...girls around here. Come on.

331
00:45:37,416 --> 00:45:39,165
You know you want to say something.

332
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,332
Just talk to us.

333
00:45:41,416 --> 00:45:43,790
- Just talk...
- All right, easy, easy.

334
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:46,790
- What's that?
- Everything okay?

335
00:45:46,875 --> 00:45:48,665
I'm just talking to my friend Nuno here.

336
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,957
He's got something
he wants to get off his chest.

337
00:45:51,041 --> 00:45:53,015
Let's just calm down, yeah?

338
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,915
"Calm down"?

339
00:45:56,416 --> 00:45:59,290
I'm sorry. Who are you?

340
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:01,082
I'm Pascal Renouf.

341
00:46:02,041 --> 00:46:04,374
You have a daughter, Pascal?

342
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:06,332
I do. Two.

343
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:10,040
And as a father,
it's my job to keep them safe.

344
00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:13,499
- But you understand that, don't you?
- I didn't do anything.

345
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:16,332
And that's what I'm doing,
trying to get this Porco scum...

346
00:46:16,416 --> 00:46:17,957
You're just a racist bully!

347
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,540
Why don't you just leave him alone?

348
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:22,790
Go fuck yourself.

349
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:25,749
- Don't do that.
- What are you going to do?

350
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,915
Fuck! Get off!

351
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,415
Knock it off!

352
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,624
Get off of me!

353
00:46:37,708 --> 00:46:40,207
- Break it up! Easy, easy.
- All right, all right, all right!

354
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:41,874
- Get off!
- Get off him!

355
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:43,082
- Cool down!
- Get off!

356
00:46:43,166 --> 00:46:44,290
Walk that way!

357
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:50,415
Clifford questioned me.

358
00:46:52,666 --> 00:46:54,290
It was about you.

359
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,832
About your past.

360
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:25,749
What the fuck did he say?

361
00:47:25,833 --> 00:47:27,415
Don't do that.

362
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,957
I want to know what the fuck
you were talking about behind my back!

363
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:33,624
That you hurt someone.

364
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:35,540
What? Who?

365
00:47:36,166 --> 00:47:38,707
A girl, a 14-year-old girl.

366
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,040
That's what he told you? That I hurt her?

367
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:44,124
Just tell me what happened.

368
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:47,374
It was consensual. Okay?

369
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:49,790
We liked each other.

370
00:47:50,875 --> 00:47:52,790
But the parents had it in for me.

371
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:55,749
They turned her against me.

372
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:58,082
They made her say all sorts of shit.

373
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,249
I...

374
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:05,082
I regret it every single day.

375
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:17,332
He thinks you're the man
that's been killing those girls.

376
00:48:21,375 --> 00:48:23,290
Do you think it's me?

377
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:30,332
Hey.

378
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:33,207
Hey, don't walk away from me!

379
00:48:33,291 --> 00:48:35,207
What the fuck do you want from me?

380
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:37,207
I want you to tell me that you didn't do it!

381
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:42,040
I lied for you!
I said we were together that night

382
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:44,290
and I need to know
I did it for the right reason!

383
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:46,040
Yeah, well, you don't need to lie
for me any more!

384
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:47,290
I'll get through this by myself.

385
00:48:47,375 --> 00:48:49,790
Oh, God, I don't understand you.

386
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:52,707
How can you ask me that?

387
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:54,540
I love you and you're asking me that!

388
00:48:59,875 --> 00:49:01,082
Hey.

389
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:03,540
- Hey!
- What?

390
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,624
You just said you love me.

391
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:11,707
Why?

392
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:14,499
I don't know.

393
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:17,874
Just... Just happened.

394
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:23,999
Look, if you know what's good for you,
you'll turn and walk away.

395
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:27,832
But I didn't hurt those girls.

396
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:30,665
I won't walk away from you.

397
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:37,749
I love you.

398
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,082
Hi.

399
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:03,324
Thank you.

400
00:50:05,791 --> 00:50:09,707
Oh. Feel a bit underdressed.

401
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,207
You look lovely.

402
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:13,874
Wait, just that.

403
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:15,290
- What are you doing?
- Just that little there.

404
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:17,790
- So who's this lot, then?
- Um...

405
00:50:21,941 --> 00:50:25,457
- I think your mum fancies me.
- I think she does. I'll see you.

406
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:29,957
- I'll take that, thanks.
- Sure. Thank you.

407
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:33,165
Hi.

408
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:36,999
- Congratulations again.
- Oh, thank you.

409
00:50:37,625 --> 00:50:39,332
I didn't expect to see...

410
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:43,957
My boyfriend?

411
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,749
Wow! Good for you.

412
00:50:49,666 --> 00:50:51,249
What is it about him?

413
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:55,707
His smell.

414
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:04,082
- Oh, he's wearing jeans.
- They're black jeans, Polly.

415
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:07,457
You know what they're like here.

416
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:11,124
You look great.

417
00:51:12,041 --> 00:51:13,832
Everyone loves you.

418
00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:16,707
Thanks.

419
00:51:18,566 --> 00:51:20,957
Oh, I've just seen someone, sorry.

420
00:51:28,875 --> 00:51:31,040
You need to put a leash on him.

421
00:51:32,458 --> 00:51:34,624
He's just playing with Jade.

422
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:36,707
He's ruining the grass.

423
00:51:38,416 --> 00:51:40,457
Your father's been acting up,
where have you been?

424
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,165
I'm in a relationship, Mum.

425
00:51:44,208 --> 00:51:46,540
I can't be there all the time.

426
00:51:47,916 --> 00:51:50,290
Sweetheart, you can't just change the rules

427
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:51,874
because someone's shown an interest.

428
00:51:54,875 --> 00:51:57,540
Maybe I've been too soft on you.

429
00:52:25,708 --> 00:52:27,290
There we go.

430
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:28,874
- Boo!
- Ah!

431
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:35,332
You kind of scared me.

432
00:52:37,416 --> 00:52:40,374
I'm sorry, sir, but jeans aren't allowed
in the clubhouse.

433
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:44,040
It's the club dress code.

434
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:46,665
But they're black jeans!

435
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:50,540
I'm sorry.

436
00:52:57,791 --> 00:53:00,499
- So, maybe the burger, then?
- Yes.

437
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:13,165
I'd like to make a toast.

438
00:53:17,333 --> 00:53:19,499
To my family

439
00:53:21,083 --> 00:53:22,790
for everything you've done for me

440
00:53:26,083 --> 00:53:27,207
I forgive you.

441
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,624
Get out!

442
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:52,290
Actually, wait here.

443
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:02,624
You can do it.

444
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:06,290
Use the weight as you come down

445
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:08,999
and make sure that
that's at a right angle there.

446
00:56:09,083 --> 00:56:10,415
Okay.

447
00:56:12,791 --> 00:56:13,957
Yes!

448
00:56:19,166 --> 00:56:21,874
No! No!

449
00:57:19,916 --> 00:57:22,915
- I haven't got it in me.
- Yeah, you do.

450
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,624
Anticipate its movements.

451
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:33,082
Feel its every breath

452
00:57:34,916 --> 00:57:36,582
every heartbeat.

453
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,540
It's still alive.

454
00:58:15,875 --> 00:58:18,040
It's crueller if you leave it like that.

455
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:19,665
I can't.

456
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:21,499
Yeah, you can,
just pick it up by its back legs.

457
00:58:21,583 --> 00:58:23,165
I don't want to.

458
00:58:32,541 --> 00:58:34,807
All right, all right.

459
00:58:40,541 --> 00:58:41,957
You okay?

460
00:58:45,416 --> 00:58:46,707
Yeah.

461
00:59:30,041 --> 00:59:31,290
What's that?

462
00:59:41,041 --> 00:59:42,790
Open the door!

463
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:44,874
Hello? What's going on?

464
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:46,749
- Is your name Pascal Renouf?
- Yeah.

465
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,374
I'm DCI Steven May.

466
00:59:48,458 --> 00:59:50,207
What? What are you talking about?

467
00:59:50,291 --> 00:59:51,740
She's up here.

468
00:59:55,916 --> 00:59:57,415
What's going on?

469
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:42,624
Wait here.

470
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,624
Moll, this is DCI Theresa Kelly.

471
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:13,082
She's come over from the mainland
to help with the investigation.

472
01:01:13,166 --> 01:01:16,040
Firstly, I'd like to apologise
for the surroundings.

473
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:19,957
We have a lot of people working on this
and we need the extra space.

474
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,374
Just to establish

475
01:01:23,458 --> 01:01:25,999
you are not under arrest
but you are under caution.

476
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:27,665
You do not have to say anything

477
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,790
but it may harm your defence
if you do not mention when questioned

478
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:32,957
something which you later rely on in court.

479
01:01:33,041 --> 01:01:35,874
Anything you do say can be given in evidence.

480
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:37,582
Do you understand?

481
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:41,749
Bit of a mouthful, that one.

482
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:44,707
Please state your full name.

483
01:01:45,541 --> 01:01:46,749
Can I just leave?

484
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:50,082
Why would you do that?

485
01:01:50,166 --> 01:01:52,332
Have you got something to hide?

486
01:01:53,708 --> 01:01:54,790
No.

487
01:01:58,125 --> 01:01:59,124
Name.

488
01:02:01,291 --> 01:02:02,624
Moll Huntford.

489
01:02:03,541 --> 01:02:06,999
Tell me what you were doing the night
Melissa Healey was abducted.

490
01:02:07,833 --> 01:02:09,874
June 8th of this year.

491
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:12,374
Uh...

492
01:02:13,333 --> 01:02:15,040
It was my birthday.

493
01:02:15,125 --> 01:02:19,749
I had a barbecue at my house
and I decided to leave.

494
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:23,332
So I went to the Wipeout about 10:00.

495
01:02:23,416 --> 01:02:28,874
About 10:30, I met Pascal,
we danced all night and left at closing.

496
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:33,124
Why did you leave your own birthday party?

497
01:02:35,583 --> 01:02:37,665
I wasn't enjoying the company.

498
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:44,624
Do you know a Mr Leigh Dutot?

499
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,624
Are you saying you've never met him?

500
01:03:00,458 --> 01:03:01,499
No.

501
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:04,249
Not to my knowledge.

502
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:14,707
Here you are
engaging in conversation with him.

503
01:03:18,791 --> 01:03:21,707
Well, I was drunk,
I can't remember everyone I met.

504
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:24,874
He said you danced all night together.

505
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:31,124
Moll, you won't get into any trouble
if you change your statement.

506
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:32,624
You have my word.

507
01:03:37,458 --> 01:03:40,582
Show us the pictures of the dance floor.

508
01:03:40,666 --> 01:03:42,290
That's where I met Pascal.

509
01:03:46,291 --> 01:03:48,790
Clifford, go and get some sleep.

510
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,624
Cause of death was suffocation.

511
01:04:26,041 --> 01:04:28,332
He filled her mouth with earth.

512
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:39,332
Why are you showing me these?

513
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:44,624
I need you to understand the gravity
of what we're dealing with.

514
01:04:50,291 --> 01:04:52,457
He doesn't love you, Moll.

515
01:04:52,541 --> 01:04:54,040
He can't love.

516
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:57,499
And you can't appeal to his humanity.

517
01:04:58,458 --> 01:05:00,290
He doesn't have any.

518
01:05:03,825 --> 01:05:05,465
Not again.

519
01:05:09,416 --> 01:05:11,415
They'll be back on in a moment.

520
01:05:33,708 --> 01:05:36,290
I entered the Wipeout at 10:00 p.m.

521
01:05:38,458 --> 01:05:41,082
Shortly afterwards, I met Pascal.

522
01:05:41,166 --> 01:05:43,915
We danced all night and left at sunrise.

523
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,915
You weren't popular in school, were you?

524
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:04,832
I was bullied.

525
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:07,124
So was I.

526
01:06:08,375 --> 01:06:09,999
So were lots of people.

527
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,082
- But you tried to kill a girl.
- No.

528
01:06:13,166 --> 01:06:16,457
It was a mistake. I was defending myself.

529
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:22,457
You see, it makes me wonder...

530
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:27,707
Are you protecting Pascal
because you think he's innocent

531
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:32,874
or is this just another way
of taking revenge on the world?

532
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,040
You think because you sing in the choir

533
01:06:41,125 --> 01:06:43,207
and you help look after your father

534
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:45,790
you can fool people into thinking
you're someone else.

535
01:09:11,833 --> 01:09:12,915
Good morning, Miss Huntford.

536
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,165
I'd like to ask you a few questions
for Channel Television.

537
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:17,932
Miss Huntford. Miss Huntford!

538
01:09:18,416 --> 01:09:21,457
Okay, let's just do this here. You ready?

539
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:26,165
I'm standing outside
the house of Pascal Renouf

540
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:29,124
a local man with a previous conviction
for sexual assault.

541
01:09:29,208 --> 01:09:32,082
He's being held for questioning
for a further 36 hours.

542
01:09:32,166 --> 01:09:34,832
Now, this is all happening on the day
of Melissa Healey's funeral

543
01:09:34,916 --> 01:09:36,374
so emotions and tensions...

544
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:40,174
Miss Huntford!

545
01:09:41,375 --> 01:09:45,040
Miss Huntford! Just a couple of
questions, please, just need to ask you.

546
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:47,374
Just a couple of questions.
Miss Huntford, please!

547
01:09:47,458 --> 01:09:50,665
...explore some of the rugged
and wild landscape

548
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:53,915
and give you a chance
to whet your appetite before lunch

549
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,915
by tasting some of the wines of Jersey

550
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,665
in one of Jersey's largest vineyards.

551
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:02,499
After that, we will be then
going up to the...

552
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:04,249
Over to the east.

553
01:10:06,083 --> 01:10:07,957
We'll be going over...

554
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,540
I'm so sorry.

555
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:14,432
Terry, do you mind pulling...

556
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:58,332
- Thank you, have a nice day! Bye.
- Thanks so much. You, too.

557
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:05,374
- Green looks great on redheads.
- Yeah, I've got one just like it.

558
01:11:05,458 --> 01:11:08,624
Then... What about this?

559
01:11:16,041 --> 01:11:17,499
Moll Huntford.

560
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:23,040
Would you like to, um, try it on?

561
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:25,124
I just wanted to talk to you.

562
01:11:25,208 --> 01:11:26,540
About?

563
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:29,582
About what happened.

564
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:31,915
It was 14 years ago.

565
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,124
I know, I just wanted to set things right.

566
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:35,749
So you came to my shop?

567
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:39,707
I'm so sorry about what happened.
It was a mistake.

568
01:11:39,791 --> 01:11:41,374
I'm a good person.

569
01:11:42,333 --> 01:11:44,499
What's wrong with you?

570
01:11:44,583 --> 01:11:45,915
Nothing's wrong with me.

571
01:11:46,958 --> 01:11:48,665
I was defending myself.

572
01:11:49,541 --> 01:11:50,665
What?

573
01:11:52,625 --> 01:11:54,582
Are you saying I deserved this?

574
01:11:54,666 --> 01:11:57,540
No. No. No, no, I'm not...

575
01:11:57,625 --> 01:11:59,415
Get the fuck out of here.

576
01:12:00,791 --> 01:12:02,374
Get out!

577
01:13:24,583 --> 01:13:26,040
Please be seated.

578
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:37,415
How can we begin to find words

579
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:42,040
to express the grief in the hearts
of Lionel and Sophie?

580
01:13:44,083 --> 01:13:46,957
Nothing will take away
the loss you have suffered

581
01:13:48,416 --> 01:13:52,290
and nothing will replace
the pain in our hearts today.

582
01:13:54,875 --> 01:13:56,290
You need to leave.

583
01:13:57,458 --> 01:13:59,874
But we may take some comfort

584
01:13:59,958 --> 01:14:02,582
that the perpetrator will be judged

585
01:14:03,791 --> 01:14:05,415
and will have to account for his actions...

586
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,082
Fuck off.

587
01:14:07,166 --> 01:14:08,499
...like all of us.

588
01:14:09,208 --> 01:14:12,124
Because God's judgment never fails...

589
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:25,790
For we must all appear
before the judgment seat of Christ

590
01:14:26,666 --> 01:14:30,665
that each may receive what is due
for what he has done

591
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:35,374
whether good or evil.

592
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:45,415
What are you doing?

593
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:47,915
I just want to offer my condolences.

594
01:14:48,916 --> 01:14:52,374
No, leave with me
and we'll forget about everything.

595
01:14:52,458 --> 01:14:54,457
Okay? It'll be just like it was.

596
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,790
Moll, please don't.

597
01:15:02,458 --> 01:15:04,749
I'm so sorry for your loss.

598
01:15:21,125 --> 01:15:22,332
Hey!

599
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:24,624
Where do you think you're going?

600
01:15:27,416 --> 01:15:28,415
Hey!

601
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,371
Hey!

602
01:16:39,416 --> 01:16:40,957
Can we talk?

603
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:45,374
Inside?

604
01:16:52,125 --> 01:16:53,374
Leave it open.

605
01:17:03,458 --> 01:17:04,790
We got him.

606
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:10,790
Nuno Alvarez, Portuguese man,
worked on the farms.

607
01:17:13,541 --> 01:17:15,415
He finally made a mistake.

608
01:17:18,833 --> 01:17:21,707
I just wanted you to hear it from me

609
01:17:23,458 --> 01:17:27,040
and I wanted to apologise
for everything I've put you through.

610
01:17:33,875 --> 01:17:35,082
What, it's...

611
01:17:37,625 --> 01:17:39,165
It's over?

612
01:17:40,833 --> 01:17:41,915
Yes.

613
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:44,749
It's over.

614
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,499
This doesn't mean that Pascal isn't bad news.

615
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:59,082
And it doesn't change
the way I feel about you.

616
01:18:05,458 --> 01:18:08,374
Do you know what I dislike
most about you, Cliff?

617
01:18:13,333 --> 01:18:14,832
Your smell.

618
01:20:43,125 --> 01:20:45,332
What would you have done if it was me?

619
01:20:48,958 --> 01:20:50,374
But it wasn't.

620
01:20:51,625 --> 01:20:53,582
Must have crossed your mind.

621
01:20:57,916 --> 01:20:59,915
I believed in you.

622
01:21:09,041 --> 01:21:11,040
- Would you still love me?
- What?

623
01:21:13,458 --> 01:21:15,415
Why are you asking me that?

624
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:22,624
My mother left me when I was in prison.

625
01:21:22,708 --> 01:21:24,999
I never heard from her again.

626
01:21:25,958 --> 01:21:27,957
She told me she loved me.

627
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:35,332
Hey.

628
01:21:38,541 --> 01:21:40,207
I'm still here.

629
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:26,999
It's over.

630
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:39,290
You all right with that?

631
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:43,707
I'm sorry. Watch the waterfall.

632
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:47,290
All right?

633
01:22:47,375 --> 01:22:49,415
Come on, I want to dance! Come on.

634
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:50,665
All right.

635
01:22:55,291 --> 01:22:57,665
I want to leave this place.

636
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:59,457
But you just bought another round.

637
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:01,915
No, no, no, no, the island.

638
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,749
We could just run away.

639
01:23:03,833 --> 01:23:07,124
We could just go somewhere
really hot or, or cold

640
01:23:07,208 --> 01:23:09,332
or I don't know, I don't know,
just somewhere.

641
01:23:09,916 --> 01:23:12,999
I've got a life here,
I've got a business, a house.

642
01:23:13,083 --> 01:23:16,499
I can't live here, Pascal.

643
01:23:27,333 --> 01:23:28,915
I gave up everything for you.

644
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,624
Yeah, well, I didn't ask you
to give everything up.

645
01:23:30,708 --> 01:23:32,415
I lied for you!

646
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:33,540
And I appreciate that

647
01:23:33,625 --> 01:23:36,915
but you can't just rip my life apart
because you don't like the weather!

648
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:40,374
Hey, you're hurting me.

649
01:23:40,458 --> 01:23:43,999
Good, maybe it'll sink in.
Keep your fucking mouth shut!

650
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:49,082
- You got something to hide?
- Don't push me.

651
01:23:49,166 --> 01:23:52,290
What are you going to do?
You going to hurt me? Go on!

652
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:55,165
Go on! Fucking hurt me
like you hurt that girl.

653
01:24:16,333 --> 01:24:19,374
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

654
01:24:37,916 --> 01:24:38,915
Moll!

655
01:24:40,916 --> 01:24:41,957
Moll!

656
01:25:06,416 --> 01:25:08,249
I need to talk to you.

657
01:25:22,291 --> 01:25:23,790
What do you want?

658
01:25:25,041 --> 01:25:26,832
How do you know it was him?

659
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:30,790
- Who?
- Nuno Alvarez.

660
01:25:33,125 --> 01:25:34,790
Evidence.

661
01:25:34,875 --> 01:25:36,540
His DNA was all over her.

662
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:39,207
Did he... Did he confess?

663
01:25:39,291 --> 01:25:41,999
- He said they were on a date.
- Maybe they were.

664
01:25:42,083 --> 01:25:45,124
With a 16-year-old girl
who was murdered that evening?

665
01:25:45,208 --> 01:25:48,624
Yeah, I'm not being funny
but that's pretty unlucky.

666
01:25:50,833 --> 01:25:51,957
So...

667
01:25:53,291 --> 01:25:55,582
you going to tell me what this is about?

668
01:25:56,375 --> 01:25:58,790
Now, you can talk to me, Moll, you know that.

669
01:25:59,541 --> 01:26:01,457
Regardless of what happened.

670
01:26:07,666 --> 01:26:08,874
I lied.

671
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:13,707
I didn't see Pascal at the Wipeout.

672
01:26:16,208 --> 01:26:18,207
You think it's Pascal?

673
01:26:21,291 --> 01:26:23,124
Why are you smiling?

674
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:28,749
You know, I was always there for you

675
01:26:28,833 --> 01:26:30,457
but you wanted a bit of rough.

676
01:26:31,141 --> 01:26:34,040
- You're a monster.
- So I'm a monster?

677
01:26:37,958 --> 01:26:41,790
You're the one who lied during
a multiple murder investigation.

678
01:26:45,125 --> 01:26:48,540
What's wrong with you? Hmm?

679
01:26:48,625 --> 01:26:50,415
Nothing's wrong with me.

680
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:53,332
Do you want to go to jail?

681
01:26:54,083 --> 01:26:55,665
Is that it?

682
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:56,915
No?

683
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,374
- No.
- No.

684
01:27:08,875 --> 01:27:09,957
Get out.

685
01:27:11,166 --> 01:27:12,582
Go on, fuck off.

686
01:31:06,333 --> 01:31:07,374
Pascal?

687
01:32:08,208 --> 01:32:09,207
Hey.

688
01:32:11,375 --> 01:32:12,374
Hey.

689
01:32:18,625 --> 01:32:20,082
Where have you been?

690
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,999
I had to think about a lot of things.

691
01:32:25,791 --> 01:32:28,082
I'm sorry about what I said last night.

692
01:32:29,166 --> 01:32:30,790
I didn't mean it.

693
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:38,749
I feel terrible about last night.
I was just, I was...

694
01:32:40,291 --> 01:32:42,499
I was drunk and, um...

695
01:32:44,875 --> 01:32:48,040
What with everything that's happened,
I just lost it. I'm really...

696
01:32:50,208 --> 01:32:51,540
I'm sorry.

697
01:32:54,833 --> 01:32:57,415
And look, if you still want
to go away, then...

698
01:32:58,541 --> 01:33:00,790
You want to leave this place, I'm in.

699
01:33:02,791 --> 01:33:04,290
You'd do that for me?

700
01:33:05,166 --> 01:33:06,832
I'd do anything for you.

701
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:47,124
No cities, I need mountains or sea.

702
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:52,165
How about Norway?

703
01:33:53,958 --> 01:33:55,165
You get both.

704
01:33:56,791 --> 01:33:57,957
Yeah.

705
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:00,832
Viking country, I could do that.

706
01:34:17,333 --> 01:34:19,540
I need to tell you something.

707
01:34:23,125 --> 01:34:24,874
I know it was you.

708
01:34:26,625 --> 01:34:27,707
What?

709
01:34:29,791 --> 01:34:31,540
I know it was you.

710
01:34:40,291 --> 01:34:41,290
This a wind-up?

711
01:34:42,625 --> 01:34:44,040
You were sick.

712
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:48,290
You had a sickness and it overpowered you

713
01:34:49,416 --> 01:34:52,165
and you fought it for a long time
and now you're better

714
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:54,457
and I need to hear you say it.

715
01:34:55,375 --> 01:34:57,415
I need us to be absolutely honest
with each other

716
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:59,582
if we're going to start a new life together.

717
01:35:00,541 --> 01:35:02,374
You need help.

718
01:35:03,375 --> 01:35:05,290
I'm not who I say I am.

719
01:35:08,958 --> 01:35:12,540
The girl I stabbed,
it wasn't an accident, it was revenge.

720
01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:15,249
I tried to kill her.

721
01:35:16,541 --> 01:35:18,207
You tried to kill a girl? Why...

722
01:35:19,125 --> 01:35:20,582
Why are you telling me this?

723
01:35:20,666 --> 01:35:23,415
I'm telling you because
I know you'll understand.

724
01:35:26,041 --> 01:35:29,040
Whatever you've done and whoever you've hurt

725
01:35:29,125 --> 01:35:31,915
I can understand because we're the same.

726
01:35:32,833 --> 01:35:35,499
And so from the deepest part of who I am

727
01:35:37,708 --> 01:35:39,249
I accept you.

728
01:35:42,458 --> 01:35:45,082
And I won't give up on you, not for them

729
01:35:45,166 --> 01:35:47,874
not for anything that you've done.

730
01:35:47,958 --> 01:35:51,540
I'm prepared to give you all of my love

731
01:35:51,625 --> 01:35:55,207
as deep and as powerful
as a human can give another human.

732
01:35:59,916 --> 01:36:01,290
But I need...

733
01:36:03,125 --> 01:36:05,540
I need you to tell me it's over.

734
01:36:31,666 --> 01:36:32,999
It's over.

735
01:36:42,541 --> 01:36:44,624
They were nothing to me.

736
01:36:50,875 --> 01:36:53,457
Hi, guys. Sorry about the wait.

737
01:36:53,541 --> 01:36:54,665
Here's your steaks.

738
01:36:56,375 --> 01:36:59,040
Is there anything else I can get for you?

739
01:37:00,958 --> 01:37:03,082
Any mustard or mayonnaise?

740
01:37:05,625 --> 01:37:07,707
Okay, enjoy your meal, then.

741
01:37:15,166 --> 01:37:16,165
Cheers.

742
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:22,624
Cheers.

743
01:37:33,125 --> 01:37:35,040
Can we get out of here?

744
01:38:33,375 --> 01:38:34,624
Kiss me.

745
01:40:54,666 --> 01:40:56,290
Wait, wait.

746
01:41:00,750 --> 01:41:02,399
We're the same.

746
01:41:03,305 --> 01:42:03,628
