2
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,353
Hunger strike?
How long has this been going on?

3
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:19,147
She hasn't had a thing
yesterday or today.

4
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:21,265
- Send her meals up regularly?
- Yes, sir.

5
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:26,153
- Why don't you jam it down her throat?
- It's not as simple as that, Mr. Andrews.

6
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:29,740
I'll talk to her myself.
Have some food brought up to her.

7
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,575
Yes, sir.

8
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,995
I'm not going to eat until
you let me off this boat!

9
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,748
Come, now, Ellie.
You know I'll have my way.

10
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:41,251
Not this time, you won't.
I'm already married to him.

11
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,421
You're never going live under
the same roof. I'll see to that.

12
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,325
Can't you get it through your head
King Westley and I are married?

13
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:49,885
Definitely, legally,
actually married.

14
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:54,014
It's over. There's not a thing you
can do. I'm over 21. So is he.

15
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,067
Would it interest you to know
while you've been on board...

16
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:58,628
I've been making arrangements
to have your marriage annulled?

17
00:01:58,728 --> 00:02:02,481
"Annulled!" I'll have something to
say about that, and so will King.

18
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,173
I expect him to.

19
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,070
The vittles. Come in, come in.

20
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,489
I told you not to bring any food in.

21
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:14,250
Wait a minute. This isn't for you.
Put it right down here.

22
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,421
Smart, aren't you? So subtle.

23
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:26,839
Strategy, my dear.

24
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:31,051
I suppose it was strategy sending gorillas
to drag me from that justice of the peace.

25
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,220
Your idea of strategy is a lead pipe.

26
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,264
I've won a lot of arguments
with a lead pipe.

27
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:39,226
Outside the fact you don't like him,
you haven't got a thing against King.

28
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,312
- He's a fake.
- He's one of the best fliers in the country.

29
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,982
You married him only
because I told you not to.

30
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,293
You've been telling me what not
to do since I can remember.

31
00:02:47,393 --> 00:02:49,222
Because you've always
been a stubborn idiot.

32
00:02:49,323 --> 00:02:51,580
I come from a long line
of stubborn idiots!

33
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,616
Don't shout so. You may
work up an appetite.

34
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,661
I'll shout if I want to!
I'll scream if I want to!

35
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,122
- All right, scream.
- If you don't let me off...

36
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,624
I'll break every piece of
furniture in this room!

37
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,753
Here, now. Have a nice
piece of juicy steak.

38
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,172
You don't have to eat it.
Just smell it.

39
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,139
It's a poem.

40
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,431
Oh!

41
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,815
Ellie! Ellie!

42
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,187
Ellie!

43
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,987
Ellen!

44
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,858
- Lower the boats!
- Lower the boats!

45
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,777
Catch her! Catch her!

46
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,119
Come on, men. Come on!

47
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,536
- She got away.
- Of course. She's too smart for you.

48
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,539
Send a wireless to the
Lovington Detective Agency.

49
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,875
"Daughter escaped again.
Watch all roads...

50
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,211
airports, and railway
stations in Miami."

51
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:49,087
All aboard!

52
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:52,716
Palm Beach, Savannah, Jacksonville...

53
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,968
New York, Philadelphia...

54
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,971
We're wasting our time.
You imagine Ellie Andrews riding a bus?

55
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,140
I told the old man it was bunk.

56
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,024
Ticket for New York, please.

57
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,281
- Here's your ticket.
- Thank you very much.

58
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:14,120
- Here.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

59
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,160
What's going on?
I'd like to use that phone.

60
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,372
Go away. This is
history in the making.

61
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,458
- What?
- There's a man biting a dog in there.

62
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,919
Attaboy, Petey, old boy!

63
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,338
I can't stand this any longer.

64
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:34,591
- In a pig's eye, you will!
- That's telling him!

65
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,052
Listen, monkey face,
when you fired me...

66
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:40,823
you fired the best newshound your
filthy scandal sheet ever had.

67
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:44,601
You wouldn't know a newspaper
story if it kicked you in the pants.

68
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,395
Yeah, I got all your copy.

69
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:49,857
Why didn't you tell me you were
going to write it in Greek?

70
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,526
That was free verse,
you gashouse palooka.

71
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,529
What was free about it?
It cost this paper dough...

72
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,823
and it's not gonna cost us any more.

73
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,325
Mr. Gordon, he reversed
the charge on that call.

74
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,953
What? Why, you...

75
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,747
Say, listen, you. When you
get back to New York...

76
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,875
keep far away from this office.

77
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:12,052
You're fired. You don't work here
anymore, and you never will.

78
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,431
What did he say?

79
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:20,477
Oh, so you're changing your tune?

80
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,974
You're late with your apologies.

81
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:28,020
I wouldn't go back to work for you
if you begged on hands and knees!

82
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,564
I hope this will be a lesson to you!

83
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,482
That's telling him, isn't it?

84
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,109
Did we tell that baby?

85
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,279
- Won't give me any more of his lip.
- You tell him!

86
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,282
I guess he knows now
how I feel about his job.

87
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,160
- I'll bet he does too.
- Is my chariot ready?

88
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,914
Your chariot awaiteth
"withouteth," O mighty king.

89
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,625
Lead on, sire.

90
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:52,878
- Make way for the king.
- Make way for the king.

91
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,631
Long live the king.

92
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:58,050
Make way for the king.

93
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,057
Philadelphia. New York. All aboard!

94
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,851
- Attaboy.
- Look out for the king's baggage.

95
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,646
Your good-bye chariot.

96
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,699
Scram!

97
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,906
Make yourself comfortable
with a pleasant pillow.

98
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:24,284
Pillow, sir? Two bits.

99
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,453
A thousand miles is a long trip.

100
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,004
Make yourself comfortable
with a pleasant pillow.

101
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,125
Hey, driver!

102
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,511
If you'll move those newspapers,
I'll have a seat.

103
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,981
Hey, wait a minute!

104
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,728
- What do you think you're doing?
- Huh?

105
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,147
The papers... what's the
idea of throwing them out?

106
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,818
Oh, the papers?
That's a long story, my friend.

107
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,278
I never did like
sitting on newspapers.

108
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:04,449
I did it once, and the headlines
came off on my white pants.

109
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,661
It actually happened.
Nobody bought a paper that day.

110
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:11,873
They just followed me around town and
read the news off the seat of my pants.

111
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:16,218
Oh, fresh guy? What you
need's a good sock on the nose.

112
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,090
Listen, partner...

113
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,551
you may not like my nose, but I do.

114
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,678
I always wear it out in the open...

115
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,563
where if anybody wants
to sock it, they can.

116
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,649
Oh, yeah?

117
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,604
That's a brilliant answer.
Why didn't I think of it?

118
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,107
Our conversation could
have been over long ago.

119
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,650
Oh, yeah?

120
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,570
If you keep that up,
we're not going to get anywhere.

121
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,787
Oh, yeah?

122
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,867
You got me. Yeah!

123
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,753
Excuse me, lady...

124
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:00,054
but that upon which you sit is mine.

125
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,383
- I beg your pardon?
- Now, listen.

126
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,969
I put up a stiff fight
for that seat...

127
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,687
so if it's just the
same to you, scram.

128
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,100
Driver, are these seats reserved?

129
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,478
No. First come, first served.

130
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:17,064
- Thank you.
- Hey, driver.

131
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,191
These seats accommodate
two, don't they?

132
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,193
Maybe they do and maybe they don't.

133
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,993
Thank you.

134
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,908
Move over.

135
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,417
This is a "maybe they do."

136
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:41,804
If you'd ask me real nice, I might
put that bag up there for you.

137
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,408
Next time you drop in,
bring your folks.

138
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,898
Red-hot coffee, folks. Yes, sir.

139
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:27,217
Come on inside and enjoy
yourselves. Hot dogs, folks.

140
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,387
You can't enjoy the ride unless
you put something in your stomach.

141
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,556
Rest station. Fifteen minutes.

142
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:35,692
- We'll only be here 15 minutes.
- Red-hot coffee.

143
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:40,981
Right around there, boss. Yes, sir!
Red-hot coffee. Hot dogs.

144
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:44,442
You can't enjoy the ride unless
you put something in your stomach.

145
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,977
He got away.

146
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:30,280
I suddenly found myself in the
brush and not a sign of the skunk.

147
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,534
I don't know what you're raving about, young
man, and furthermore, I'm not interested.

148
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,703
Well, of all the...

149
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,332
Maybe you'll be interested
to know your bag's gone.

150
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:44,294
- Oh, my heavens, it's gone!
- I knew you'd catch on eventually.

151
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,130
Oh! What am I going to do now!

152
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,299
Don't tell me your ticket was in it.

153
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,970
No, I've got that, but not my money.
All I have is four dollars.

154
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,973
You can wire home for more
when you get to Jacksonville.

155
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,851
No, I can't... Yes, I guess I will.

156
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:03,605
- I'll tell the driver about your bag.
- No! Thank you. I'd rather you didn't.

157
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,691
Don't be a fool.
The company ought to make good.

158
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,236
- What's your name?
- I don't want it reported.

159
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,571
That's ridiculous.
The company will take care...

160
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,740
Can you understand English?

161
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,159
Would you please keep
out of my affairs?

162
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,669
I want to be left alone.

163
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,501
Why, you ungrateful brat.

164
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,253
Board!

165
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,178
All aboard!

166
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,474
Board!

167
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,649
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks.

168
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:12,609
Jacksonville. Thirty minutes
for breakfast, folks.

169
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:16,029
- Only 30 minutes for breakfast.
- Read all about it!

170
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,990
Just 30 minutes. That's all. No more.

171
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,785
Thirty minutes for breakfast,
folks. That's all.

172
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,162
Read all about it!

173
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,755
Just 30 minutes
for breakfast. That's all.

174
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,517
Oh.

175
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,485
Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

176
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,905
Silly, isn't it?

177
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:55,492
Why, everybody's gone!

178
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,622
Oh. Thank you very much.

179
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,119
We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?

180
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:06,002
Yes.

181
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,125
That was foolish of me.

182
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:13,503
W-Well, why didn't you shove me away?

183
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,630
I hated to wake you up.

184
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,508
You look kind of pretty asleep.

185
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,510
How about some breakfast?

186
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,720
Oh, no, no. No, thank you.

187
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,557
No, I'm going to the Windsor Hotel.

188
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:29,352
Windsor? You'll never make it in time.
We leave in half an hour.

189
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,862
Oh, no. They'll wait for me.

190
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,235
Driver, I'm going to
be a few minutes late.

191
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:40,321
- Be sure to wait for me.
- Oh, yeah?

192
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,706
Yes.

193
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:07,348
- Where's the bus to New York?
- It left about 20 minutes ago.

194
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,309
But that's ridiculous.

195
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,061
I was on that bus.
I told them to wait.

196
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,230
I'm sorry, miss, but it's gone.

197
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,149
Good morning.

198
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:20,202
Remember me? I'm the fellow
you slept on last night.

199
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,781
Seems to me I've already
thanked you for that.

200
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,701
- What time is the next bus?
- 8:00 tonight.

201
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,746
Eight o'clo... That's 12 hours!

202
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,880
I'm sorry, miss.

203
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,502
What's the matter?
Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?

204
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,087
What are you excited about?
You missed it too.

205
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,055
Yeah, I missed it too.

206
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,892
Don't tell me you did
it on my account.

207
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:48,355
I hope you haven't any idea that
what happened last night...

208
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,851
Look here, young man, you needn't
concern yourself about me.

209
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,522
- I can take care of myself.
- You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.

210
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,732
Here's your ticket.

211
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,158
- My ticket?
- I found it on the seat.

212
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,616
Thank you.

213
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,543
It must have fallen out of my purse.

214
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,421
You'll never get away
with it, Miss Andrews.

215
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,042
What are you talking about?

216
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:20,345
Your father will stop you before
you get halfway to New York.

217
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,133
You must have me confused
with someone else.

218
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,601
Quit kidding. It's all
over the front page.

219
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:36,062
I've always been curious to know
what kind of girl would marry...

220
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,398
a front-page aviator
like King Westley.

221
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,025
Take my advice: Grab the
next bus back to Miami.

222
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,285
That guy's a phony.

223
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,490
I didn't ask for your advice.

224
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,451
That's right. You didn't.

225
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,329
You're not going to notify
my father, are you?

226
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,206
What for?

227
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,650
You probably could get
some money out of him.

228
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:59,127
I never thought of that.

229
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:02,755
If you promise not to,
I'll pay you as much as he will.

230
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:07,343
You won't gain anything by giving me away
as long as I make it worth your while.

231
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,749
I've got to get to New York
without being stopped.

232
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:14,142
It's terribly important to me. I'd pay
you now, only the only thing I had...

233
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:18,313
when I jumped off was a wristwatch,
and I had to pawn that to get clothes.

234
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,392
I'll give you my address.
Get in touch with me

235
00:17:20,493 --> 00:17:23,252
- the minute you get to New York.
- Never mind.

236
00:17:23,353 --> 00:17:26,321
I had you pegged right
from the jump...

237
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,531
just a spoiled brat of a rich father.

238
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,200
The only way you get
anything is to buy it.

239
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,580
You're in a jam, and all you can think of
is your money. It never fails, does it?

240
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,624
Ever hear of the word "humility"?

241
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:41,127
No, you wouldn't. I guess it never
occurred to you to just say...

242
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,963
"Please, mister, I'm in trouble.
Will you help me?"

243
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,382
No. That'd bring you down
off your high horse.

244
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:51,012
Let me tell you something:
You don't have to worry about me.

245
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,556
I'm not interested in your
money or your problem.

246
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:57,651
You, King Westley, your father...
you're all a lot of hooey to me.

247
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,068
Do you send telegrams here?

248
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:08,161
I'm just fine, thanks.
And how are you?

249
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,662
"To Joe Gordon, in care of
New York Mail, New York.

250
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,205
"Am I laughing.

251
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:20,166
The biggest scoop of the
year just dropped in my lap.

252
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,293
I know where Ellen Andrews is."

253
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,462
No! Do you really?

254
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,756
Go on, go on. Send the telegram.

255
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,926
"How would you like to have
the story, you big tub of..."

256
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,678
"of..."

257
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,888
- "Mush."
- "Tub of mush.

258
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,265
Well, try and get it.
What I said about...

259
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,018
never writing another
line for you still goes.

260
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,354
Are you burning? Peter Warne."

261
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,398
That'll be $2.60.

262
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:45,441
- Send it collect.
- "Collect"?

263
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,325
Collect.

264
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:53,282
Bus leaving for Savannah,
Charleston, Columbia...

265
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,994
Greensborough, Richmond,
Washington, Baltimore...

266
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,372
Philadelphia, New York.

267
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:03,501
Savannah, Charleston, Columbia...

268
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,962
Greensborough, Richmond...

269
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,256
Washington, Baltimore...

270
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,270
All aboard!

271
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,735
Hi, sister. All alone?

272
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,945
My name's Shapeley.
Might as well get acquainted.

273
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:34,490
It's gonna be a long trip. Gets tiresome,
especially for somebody like you.

274
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,703
You look like you've got class.
Yes, sir, with a capital K.

275
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:42,665
And I'm the guy that knows class
when he sees it, believe you me.

276
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:46,294
Ask the boys. They'll tell you:
"Shapeley knows how to pick 'em."

277
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:50,173
Yes, sir. Shapeley's the name,
and that's the way I like 'em.

278
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:52,341
You made no mistake
sitting next to me.

279
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,720
The mugs on a hop like this ain't
nothin' to write home about.

280
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,556
You gotta be awful careful
who you hit it up with.

281
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:01,142
You can't be too particular neither.

282
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,770
What's the matter, sister?
You ain't sayin' much.

283
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,964
Seems to me you're doing excellently
without any assistance.

284
00:20:08,064 --> 00:20:09,358
That's pretty good.

285
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,570
"Seems to me you're doing excellently
without any assistance."

286
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:16,331
Well, shut my big nasty mouth!

287
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,243
Looks like you're one up on me.

288
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,497
There's nothing I like better
than to meet a high-class mama...

289
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:24,582
that can snap 'em back at ya.

290
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:28,211
The colder they are, the hotter
they get. That's what I always say.

291
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:32,006
Yes, sir. When a cold
mama gets hot...

292
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,050
boy, how she sizzles!

293
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,471
You're just my type.

294
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:42,016
Believe me, sister, I could
go for you in a big way.

295
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,101
"Fun-on-the-side
Shapeley," they call me...

296
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,480
with accent on the "fun,"
believe you me.

297
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,241
Believe you me,
you bore me to distraction.

298
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,822
Looks like you're two up on me now.

299
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,282
- Hey, you.
- Huh?

300
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,869
- There's a seat over there for you.
- What's the idea?

301
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:05,456
I'd like to sit next to my
wife, if you don't mind.

302
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,917
- Your wife?
- Yeah.

303
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,752
Come on, come on.

304
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,129
Oh, yeah, sure. Excuse me.

305
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,382
I was just... Excuse me, miss.

306
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:17,844
I just was trying to make
things pleasant, you see?

307
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:21,013
Excuse me. I... I didn't
mean anything, doc.

308
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,684
- N-no offense, doc.
- No.

309
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,651
No.

310
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:34,944
If you promise not to snap my
head off, I'd like to thank you.

311
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,238
Forget it. I didn't do it for you.

312
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,581
His voice gets on my nerves.

313
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,416
What'd you do all day?

314
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:52,594
Ran in and out of doorways
trying to keep out of the rain.

315
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,848
Your clothes are all wet.

316
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,012
Here.

317
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:04,515
- You're as helpless as a baby.
- Thank you.

318
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:07,184
Here you are, folks:
cigars, cigarettes...

319
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,645
chewing gum, candy, magazines.

320
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,571
Here, boy.

321
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,526
- Yes, ma'am?
- A box of chocolates, please.

322
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,486
Never mind. She doesn't want it.

323
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,530
- But the lady...
- Of course I do!

324
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,490
Beat it!

325
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,667
You've got your nerve! Here, boy.

326
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,831
Dollar and 60 cents.

327
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,125
You had four dollars last night.

328
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:34,879
How do you expect to get to New
York at the rate you're going?

329
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,797
That is none of your business.

330
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,258
You're on a budget from now on.

331
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,560
- Just a minute. You can't...
- Shut up.

332
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,286
- What's the matter, Officer?
- Bridge washout.

333
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,455
Looks like we can't get
through till morning.

334
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,083
If any of you passengers
want a place to sleep...

335
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,752
you'll find an auto camp
up yonder a piece.

336
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:17,213
- Where?
- Right over there. See those lights?

337
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,465
- Oh, yeah.
- Dyke's Auto Camp.

338
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,759
All right, thanks. Hey, brat.

339
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,095
Are you talking to me?

340
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:27,355
Yeah. Come on.
We're stopping here for the night.

341
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:46,291
- Thank you.
- Hey, come on! We're all set!

342
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:57,920
Good evening.

343
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,638
Hope you and your husband
rest comfortable.

344
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,474
Come on, come on.

345
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,650
You going to stay there all night?

346
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,833
Darn clever, these Armenians.

347
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,134
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift.

348
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:43,049
I just had the unpleasant sensation
of hearing you referred to...

349
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,342
as my husband.

350
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:49,305
Oh, yeah. I forgot to tell you:
I registered as "Mr. and Mrs."

351
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,481
Oh, you did?

352
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:55,644
What am I expected to do?
Leap for joy?

353
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,279
I kind of half expected
you to thank me.

354
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,068
Your ego is absolutely colossal.

355
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:05,203
Yeah, yeah. Not bad. How's yours?

356
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,829
You know, compared to you...

357
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,297
my friend Shapeley is an amateur.

358
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:21,003
Just whatever gave you any
idea I'd stand for this?

359
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,838
Now, wait a minute.

360
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,007
Let's get this straightened
out right now.

361
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:28,928
If you're nursing any silly notion
that I'm interested in you, forget it.

362
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,347
You're just a headline to me.

363
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,766
A headline?

364
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,352
You're not a newspaperman, are you?

365
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:39,271
Chalk up one for your side.

366
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,900
Now, listen. You want to get
to King Westley, don't you?

367
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,944
All right. I'm here to help you.

368
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,029
What I want is your story.

369
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,949
Exclusive. A day-to-day account.

370
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,493
All about your mad
flight to happiness.

371
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:56,254
I need that story. Between you
and me, I've got to have it.

372
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,343
Isn't that just too cute?

373
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:07,007
There's a brain behind that
face of yours, isn't there?

374
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,094
You've got everything nicely
figured out for yourself...

375
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,054
including this.

376
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:15,057
This? That's a matter
of simple mathematics.

377
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,268
These cabins cost
two bucks a night...

378
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:19,895
and I'm very sorry to
inform you, wifey dear...

379
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,864
that the family purse won't stand
for separate establishments.

380
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,115
Well, thank you.

381
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,909
Thank you very much.
You've been very kind.

382
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,579
It's all right with me.
Go out in the storm.

383
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,747
But I'm going to follow you, see?

384
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,667
Yeah. And if you get tough...

385
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:45,379
I'll just have to turn you over
to your old man... right now.

386
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:48,681
Savvy? Now, that's my
whole plot in a nutshell.

387
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,928
A simple story for simple people.

388
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,806
If you behave, I'll see that
you get to King Westley.

389
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:59,400
If not, I'll just have to
spill the beans to Papa.

390
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:03,738
Now, which of these
beds do you prefer?

391
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,492
This one? All right.

392
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,551
That, I suppose,
makes everything quite all right.

393
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,186
Oh, this?

394
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,558
I like privacy when I retire.

395
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:43,027
I'm very delicate in that respect.
Prying eyes annoy me.

396
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,027
Behold the walls of Jericho.

397
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:53,822
Maybe not as thick as the ones
Joshua blew down with his trumpet...

398
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,658
but a lot safer.

399
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:58,827
You see, I have no trumpet.

400
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,538
Just to show you my heart's
in the right place...

401
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,881
I'll give you my best
pair of pajamas.

402
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,678
Do you mind joining the Israelites?

403
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:12,841
You don't want to join
the Israelites? All right.

404
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:16,804
Perhaps you're interested
in how a man undresses.

405
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:20,057
There's a funny thing about that.
Quite a study in psychology.

406
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:21,850
No two men do it alike.

407
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,813
I knew a man who kept his hat on
until he was completely undressed.

408
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,856
He made a picture!

409
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,276
Years later, his secret came out.

410
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:33,362
He wore a toupee. Yeah.

411
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:35,489
I have a method all my own.

412
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,700
If you'll notice,
the coat came first...

413
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,369
then the tie, then the shirt.

414
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,496
Now, according to Hoyle...

415
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:45,040
after that, the pants should be next.

416
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,961
There's where I'm different:
I go for the shoes next.

417
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,754
First the right...

418
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,215
then the left.

419
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,883
After that...

420
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,935
it's every man for himself.

421
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,460
Still with me, brat?

422
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,548
Don't be a sucker.

423
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,502
A good night's rest will do you good.

424
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,005
Besides, you've got
nothing to worry about.

425
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:36,641
The walls of Jericho will protect
you from the big bad wolf.

426
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:54,651
Who's afraid of the big bad wolf

427
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:58,113
The big bad wolf
The big bad wolf

428
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,616
She's afraid of the big bad wolf

429
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:03,167
Tra, la, la, la, la

430
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,082
Would you mind please
putting out the light?

431
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:10,758
No, not at all.

432
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:53,419
I wish you'd take those things
off the walls of Jericho.

433
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,970
Oh, excuse me.

434
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,490
By the way, what's your name?

435
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,451
What's that?

436
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,668
Who are you?

437
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,963
Who, me?

438
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:35,085
I'm the whippoorwill
that cries in the night.

439
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:39,381
I'm the soft morning breeze
that caresses your lovely face.

440
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:42,134
You've got a name, haven't you?

441
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:45,804
Yeah, I got a name: Peter Warne.

442
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,599
"Peter Warne."

443
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,476
I don't like it.

444
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:54,361
Don't let it bother you.
You're giving it back to me in the morning.

445
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,567
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne.

446
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:03,120
The pleasure is all mine, Mrs. Warne.

447
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,634
Another message, sir.

448
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:26,762
- What is it?
- It's from Charleston, Mr. Andrews.

449
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:30,557
"Checking every northbound train. Also
assigned 20 operators to watch highways.

450
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:34,102
No sign of your daughter yet.
Will continue to do everything possible.

451
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,063
Signed, Lovington Detective Agency."

452
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,440
Just the same as all the others.

453
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,154
Yes, sir?

454
00:32:39,255 --> 00:32:41,610
I made it clear I was in a
hurry to get to New York.

455
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,321
- What are we crawling for?
- I've got it wide open, sir.

456
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,031
- Step on it!
- Yes, sir.

457
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,200
Oh, I hope she's all right, sir.

458
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,788
"All right"? Of course she's all right.
What could happen to her?

459
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,840
- Nothing, sir.
- Then shut up about it!

460
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,740
Hello?

461
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,744
Hey, mister.

462
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:30,784
Oh, hello.

463
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,161
What's the matter? You not up yet?

464
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,289
- What time is it?
- 8:00.

465
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:36,790
Here.

466
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,419
What... Oh, it's a
toothbrush. Thanks.

467
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,045
My dress...

468
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,922
you had it pressed!

469
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,174
Come on. Breakfast will be ready.

470
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,510
You sweet thing.
Where'd you get it pressed?

471
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:53,015
I'm gonna count ten. If you're not out of
that bed, I'm coming and drag you out.

472
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:56,059
- One, two, three, four, five, six...
- I really think you would.

473
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,020
- seven, eight, nine...
- I'm out, I'm out.

474
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,272
I'm out. I'm out.

475
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,490
You'll find the showers and things
just behind the second cottage.

476
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,987
Outside?

477
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,496
Certainly. All the best
homes have them outside.

478
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:14,411
Really, I-I can't go out like this.

479
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,997
- Like what?
- Like this. I have no robe.

480
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:18,915
Oh. Here.

481
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,834
- Use mine.
- Oh, thanks.

482
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,753
Come on. Make it snappy.

483
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:25,589
It's not my fault.
You got the sleeve.

484
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:29,141
- Here. Here are my puppets.
- Thanks.

485
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:33,555
Where'd you say the
showers and things were?

486
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,766
Here. Here's a towel.

487
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:37,858
Thank you.

488
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:41,772
You're kind of little, aren't you?

489
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:44,441
- Where's the shower?
- Your hair's cute like that.

490
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,534
- You should never comb it.
- I'll find it myself.

491
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,604
Are the showers in there?

492
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,731
Well, they ain't out here.

493
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,573
Thank you.

494
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,913
Can't a body have a little
privacy around here?

495
00:35:37,493 --> 00:35:41,280
If you want a shower around
here, you'll stand in line.

496
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,386
Hi, sister.
You remember me? Shapeley?

497
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:57,472
I'm sorry about last night.
Didn't know you was married.

498
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,565
You shoulda told me right off.

499
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,486
High time you got back.

500
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,864
I met some very interesting
women at the showers.

501
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:17,325
We got chatting about this and that.
You know how time flies.

502
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:23,047
Come on, sit down.

503
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,502
My, my, my. Scrambled eggs.

504
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,713
"Egg." One egg.

505
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:33,258
One doughnut. Black coffee.
That's your ration till lunch.

506
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,677
- Any complaints?
- No, no complaints.

507
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:39,181
I'd have gotten cream, but it'd
have meant buying a whole pint.

508
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:41,433
You don't have to apologize to me.

509
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,852
You'll never know how much
I appreciate all this.

510
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,730
What makes you so disgustingly
cheerful this morning?

511
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,523
It must be the spring.

512
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:51,735
I thought "believe you me"
told you a couple snappy stories.

513
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:54,488
Oh, no. He apologized for last night.

514
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:56,490
Said he didn't know we were married.

515
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,124
Just shows you how
wrong a guy can be.

516
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:02,537
Doughnut?

517
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,123
Thanks.

518
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,919
You think this whole business is silly,
don't you? I mean, running away.

519
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:11,213
No, no. Makes too good a story.

520
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:14,633
Yes, you do. You think I'm
a fool and a spoiled brat.

521
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,552
Perhaps I am, though I
don't see how I can be.

522
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,472
Spoiled people are accustomed
to having their way. I never have.

523
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,058
I've always been told what to do...

524
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,645
and how to do it and
when and with whom.

525
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:30,774
Would you believe it? This is the first
time I've ever been alone with a man.

526
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,527
- Yeah.
- It's a wonder I'm not panic-stricken.

527
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:35,987
You're doing all right.

528
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,031
Thanks.

529
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:40,659
Nurses, governesses...

530
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:44,866
chaperones, even bodyguards.
Oh, it's been a lot of fun.

531
00:37:44,967 --> 00:37:47,374
One consolation:
You can never get lonesome.

532
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:50,794
It has its moments.
It's become a sort of game...

533
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:53,213
trying to outwit Father's detectives.

534
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:57,092
I did once. I actually went
shopping without a bodyguard.

535
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,928
It was swell. I felt
absolutely immoral.

536
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,973
It didn't last long. They caught
me in a department store.

537
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:05,433
I was so mad, I ran out the back...

538
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,769
and jumped into the first car I saw.

539
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:11,481
- Guess who was in it.
- Santa Claus. Gandhi.

540
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:13,985
King Westley was in it.

541
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:17,279
Is that how you met him?

542
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:20,156
We rode around all afternoon.
Father was frantic.

543
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,417
By 6:00 he was having
all the rivers dragged.

544
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:28,623
Say, where'd you learn to dunk?
In finishing school?

545
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:31,167
Don't you start telling
me I shouldn't dunk.

546
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,129
Of course you shouldn't.
You don't know how. Dunking's an art.

547
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:38,133
Don't let it soak so long. A dip...
and sock! Into your mouth.

548
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:42,721
Let it hang too long, it'll get soft
and fall off. All a matter of timing.

549
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,807
- I'll write a book about it.
- Thanks, Professor.

550
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:49,686
Just goes to show you: 20 millions,
and you don't know how to dunk.

551
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:53,064
I'd change places with a
plumber's daughter any day.

552
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,651
How do I know who you are?
I never saw you before.

553
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,737
You can't go around
bothering my tenants.

554
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:01,156
There's no girl by that name here.

555
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,158
Besides, how do I know
you're detectives?

556
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:05,500
Show him your credentials, Mac.

557
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,457
- Detectives!
- Oh!

558
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:13,043
That's Father at work.
Peter, what'll I do?

559
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:15,962
Maybe I can jump out the window.
They won't see me.

560
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,714
Sit down. Get yourself mussed up.

561
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:21,183
Get your hair down over your
eyes and your blouse unfastened.

562
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:24,971
Yeah, I got a letter from
Aunt Bella last week.

563
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:28,391
If we don't stop over to Wilkes-Barre,
she'll never forgive us.

564
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,518
What are you talking about?

565
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,438
The baby's due next month.
They want us to come.

566
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:38,158
Oh, yeah. She saw your sister
the other day. Said she's looking swell.

567
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:44,532
- Come in.
- I hope Aunt Bella has a boy.

568
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:48,126
Grandma says it's a girl.
She hasn't missed calling one in years.

569
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,123
Man here to see you, sweetheart.

570
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,459
Me? You want to see me?

571
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,212
- What's your name?
- Are you addressin' me?

572
00:39:57,312 --> 00:40:00,131
- Yeah. What's your name?
- Hey, wait a minute.

573
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,217
That's my wife you're talking to.

574
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,886
What do you mean, coming here?
What do you want?

575
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,221
We're looking for somebody.

576
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,723
Look your head off,
but don't come in here.

577
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,351
I've got a notion to
take a sock at you.

578
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:13,979
- Take it easy, son.
- These men are detectives.

579
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,108
I don't care if they're police. They can't
bust in here shooting questions at my wife.

580
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:21,069
Don't get so excited.
The man asked a simple question.

581
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:25,907
Oh, is that so? How many times have
I told you to stop butting in?

582
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,378
You don't have to lose your temper.

583
00:40:27,479 --> 00:40:30,028
"You don't have to lose your temper."
That's what you said the other time.

584
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:33,093
Every time I try to protect you!
The other night at the dance,

585
00:40:33,194 --> 00:40:37,127
- when that Swede made a pass...
- He didn't make a pass at me!

586
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:39,736
I saw him. He kept pawing
you all over the dance floor.

587
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:43,633
- He didn't. You were drunk.
- Nuts! You're just like your old man!

588
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,885
Once a plumber's daughter,
always a plumber's daughter.

589
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,221
Ain't an ounce of
brains in your family!

590
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:51,433
- You've gone far enough!
- Shut up!

591
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:53,560
See what you've done?

592
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,980
Sorry, Mr. Warne, but we've
got to check up on everybody.

593
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:01,609
We're looking for Ellen Andrews,
the daughter of that Wall Street mug.

594
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,154
Too bad you ain't looking
for a plumber's daughter.

595
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:06,489
Quit bawling! Quit bawling!

596
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:10,417
I told you they were a
perfectly nice married couple.

597
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,467
You weren't bad,
jumping in like that.

598
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:28,470
- You've got a brain, haven't you?
- You're not so bad yourself.

599
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,472
We could start a
two-people stock company.

600
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,974
If things get tough, we'll play
the small-town auditoriums.

601
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,477
We'll call this one
The Great Deception.

602
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:37,896
What about Cinderella or
A Real Hot Love Story?

603
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,231
- No, too mushy.
- I like mushy stuff.

604
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,569
Quit bawling! You're just like...

605
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,071
- Five minutes.
- What?

606
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:47,739
Your bus leaves in five minutes.

607
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,708
Oh! Holy smoke!
We're not even packed yet.

608
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,751
I'm beginning to believe you fellas
couldn't find your way home.

609
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,711
- Yeah?
- Telegram for you.

610
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:04,339
- Bring it in.
- Another wire from Peter Warne.

611
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:06,466
Warne? Throw it in the wastebasket.

612
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:09,351
Wait a minute. What does it say?

613
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,138
"Have I got a story. Stop.

614
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:15,100
It's getting hotter and hotter.
Stop. Hope you're the same."

615
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:19,020
- Collect?
- Yes.

616
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,147
If you accept another one,
you're fired.

617
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:24,526
- Yes sir.
- That gives me a good idea for all of you!

618
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:26,402
I want action, Lovington!

619
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:29,614
- We can't do the impossible.
- What I'm asking isn't impossible.

620
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:32,575
My daughter is between here
and Miami. I want her found.

621
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:35,703
- I put extra men on all along the way.
- That's not enough.

622
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,873
Send in Clark and Brown.
You're sure she isn't with King Westley?

623
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:42,043
No. He's been trailed 24 hours
a day since this thing started.

624
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:44,940
He can't even get a phone
call we don't know about.

625
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:49,050
I'm worried, Lovington.
Something might have happened to her.

626
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,845
Brown, make arrangements
for a radio broadcast.

627
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:54,970
Coast-to-coast hookup. Offer a
reward of $10,000 for information

628
00:42:55,071 --> 00:42:56,905
- leading to her whereabouts.
- Yes, sir.

629
00:42:57,006 --> 00:42:59,227
Clark, send the story
to all the newspapers.

630
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,938
Some out-of-town papers may
not have a picture of her.

631
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:03,898
Here. Wire this to them.

632
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,651
- I want the story to break right away.
- Yes, sir.

633
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,736
Now we'll get some action!

634
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,317
That's fine. Say, fellas...

635
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:50,862
do you know that one about the
man who flew on the trapeze?

636
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:52,822
- Sure.
- Oh, yeah.

637
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:55,457
- "Flying Trapeze."
- Attaboy.

638
00:43:58,011 --> 00:43:59,954
Once I was happy

639
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,123
But now I'm forlorn

640
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:05,668
Like an old coat that
is tattered and torn

641
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:10,048
Left in this wide world
to weep and to mourn

642
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:14,219
Betrayed by a maid in her teens

643
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,437
Oh, this maid that I loved
she was handsome

644
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:22,352
And I tried all I knew how to please

645
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:26,022
But I never could please her
one quarter so well

646
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:29,943
As the man on the flying trapeze

647
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:34,155
He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

648
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:37,659
The daring young man
on the flying trapeze

649
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:41,663
His actions are graceful
All girls he does please

650
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:45,583
And my love he purloined away

651
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:55,051
Hey, I know the second verse there.

652
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:56,427
Yeah.

653
00:44:56,527 --> 00:45:00,598
Now, he'd play with a miss
like a cat with a mouse

654
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:04,352
His eyes would undress
every girl in the house

655
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:08,231
Perhaps he is better
described as a louse

656
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:11,484
And still people came just the same

657
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:16,197
Now, he smiles from the
bar on the people below

658
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:19,332
And one night he smiled on my love

659
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:24,038
She blew him a kiss and
she hollered "Bravo!"

660
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:27,125
As he hung by his
schnozzle from above

661
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:29,711
Oh, he floats through the air

662
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:31,879
With the greatest of ease

663
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:35,550
The daring young man
on the flying trapeze

664
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:39,512
His actions are graceful
The girls he does please

665
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:43,690
My love he has stolen away

666
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:48,695
Say, you mind if
I take the third one?

667
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:57,572
I wept and I whimpered
I simpered for weeks

668
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:01,576
While she spent her time
with the circus's freaks

669
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:05,455
The tears were like hailstones
that rolled down my cheeks

670
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:08,082
Alas, alack, and Alaska

671
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:12,587
I went to this fellow,
the villain and I said

672
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:16,174
I'll see that you get your deserts

673
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:20,136
His thumb to his nose
he put up with a sneer

674
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:23,765
- He sneered once again and said...
- Whoa!

675
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:27,769
He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

676
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:31,272
The daring young man
on the flying trapeze

677
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:34,567
His actions are graceful
All the girls he does please

678
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:39,371
And my love he has stolen away

679
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:49,832
- Everybody keep your seats.
- Thank the man for me, Peter.

680
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:53,169
It's the first comfortable
position I've been in all night.

681
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:57,131
Oh, she flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

682
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,467
Ma! Ma!

683
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,761
Ma! What's the matter with you?

684
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:04,347
Somebody help us!
Something's happened to her!

685
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,975
Get some water, somebody.
Let me in there, son.

686
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,895
You got some smelling salts?

687
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,779
Ma!

688
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,443
Come on. Let's give your mother
a chance to snap out of it.

689
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:21,489
Don't worry. She'll be all
right in a few minutes.

690
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:25,076
We ain't ate nothing since yesterday.

691
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:28,162
Oh? What happened to your money?

692
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,373
Ma spent it all on the tickets.

693
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:33,626
We didn't know it was
gonna be so much.

694
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:36,304
We shouldn't have come, I guess.

695
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:40,258
But Ma said there was a job
waiting for her in New York...

696
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:44,060
and if we didn't go,
she might lose it.

697
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:50,768
She'll be all right when
she's had something to eat.

698
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:55,189
Here, honey. The next town we
come to, buy some food. Come on.

699
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:58,818
I shouldn't oughta take this.
Ma'll get mad.

700
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:02,363
Don't tell her. You don't want
her to get sick again, do you?

701
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:04,782
- No, but you might need it.
- Come on.

702
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,452
- I got millions.
- Gee, thanks.

703
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:09,836
Come on. Let's go
back to your mother.

704
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,682
- Better phone for help.
- You can if you want.

705
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:31,851
The nearest town is
10 miles from here.

706
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:34,187
- Yeah?
- Say, buddy...

707
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:37,363
like to take a look at my paper?

708
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:41,736
Traveling like this, you lose track
of what's going on in the world.

709
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:45,072
Take that story there, for instance.

710
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:48,493
If I was to see that dame,
you know what I'd do?

711
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:49,492
No, what?

712
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,877
- I'd go 50-50 with you.
- Why?

713
00:48:52,978 --> 00:48:54,832
Because I don't believe
in hogging it, see?

714
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:58,461
A bird that figures that way always
ends up behind the eight ball.

715
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:01,095
That's what I always say.

716
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:07,602
- What's on your mind?
- Five Gs or I crab the works.

717
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:16,437
Let's get away from this gang,
talk this over privately.

718
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:19,113
I knew she wasn't
your wife all the time.

719
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:26,280
You know, lucky thing, my running
into you. Just the man I need.

720
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,617
- You made no mistake.
- I can use a smart guy like you.

721
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,953
When you're talking to
Shapeley, you're talking to...

722
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:33,871
You pack a gat?

723
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,499
- Huh?
- A gat, a gat.

724
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:38,834
A rod. Got any fireworks on you?

725
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,711
Why, no.

726
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,339
It's all right. I got machine
guns in my suitcase.

727
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:46,259
I'll let you have one.
We may have trouble up north...

728
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:49,242
have to shoot it out with the cops.
But if you come through,

729
00:49:49,343 --> 00:49:52,668
those five Gs are in the bag...
maybe more. I'll talk with the Killer,

730
00:49:52,769 --> 00:49:55,176
- see he takes care of you.
- "Killer"?

731
00:49:55,276 --> 00:49:58,312
Yeah, the big boy.
The boss of the outfit.

732
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,648
You're not kidnapping her, are you?

733
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:04,485
What else, stupid? You don't think
we're after that penny-ante reward?

734
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:07,655
- Ten thousand bucks?
- Chicken feed.

735
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:11,325
Hey, listen. We're holding that
dame for a million smackers.

736
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:15,538
I didn't know it was anything
like this. You see, I've got...

737
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:17,957
What's the matter?
You getting yellow?

738
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:21,043
I'm married, a couple kids.
I can't afford to...

739
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:24,505
Pipe down, you mug, before I...

740
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:27,675
What are you trying to do,
tell the whole world about it?

741
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:30,636
Listen, you're into this thing,
and you're staying in, get me?

742
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,346
You know too much.

743
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,181
I-I won't say anything, honest.

744
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:37,435
How do I know that?
I got a notion to plug you.

745
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:39,604
Why should I take a chance with you?

746
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:41,731
Trust me, mister,
I'll keep my mouth shut.

747
00:50:41,831 --> 00:50:43,531
Yeah?

748
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,527
What's your name?

749
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:48,404
Oscar Shapeley.

750
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:51,198
- Where do you live?
- Orange, New Jersey.

751
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,117
Got a couple of kids?

752
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:56,412
Y-Yes, sir. Just babies.
A little golden-haired girl...

753
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:59,165
- You love them, don't you?
- Yes, I do.

754
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:01,208
Why, you wouldn't...
You're not thinking...

755
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:04,086
- You keep your trap shut, all right?
- Sure, sure!

756
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,631
- If you don't...
- I will, I will.

757
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:09,175
You ever hear of Bugs Dooley?

758
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:11,052
B-B-Bugs Dooley? No.

759
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:15,620
A nice guy, like you, but he made a
mistake one day. Got too talkative.

760
00:51:15,721 --> 00:51:17,780
- Know what happened to his kid?
- No.

761
00:51:17,881 --> 00:51:21,270
I can't tell you, but when Bugs heard
about it, he blew his brains out.

762
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:23,898
Oh, gee, that's terrible. Terrible.

763
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:26,442
He had it coming, though.
He talked too much.

764
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:29,487
I never talk. I never say a word.
W-Word of honor.

765
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:32,365
Gee, I wouldn't want anything
to happen to my kids.

766
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:35,242
Okay. Just remember that.

767
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,911
Now beat it.

768
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:39,246
Sure, mister. Thanks.

769
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,415
I always knew you guys were...

770
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:44,377
Come on, scram. And stay
away from that bus.

771
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:46,837
Sure. Anything you say, mister.

772
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,757
- Ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
- If you don't beat it...

773
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,391
I'm going.

774
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,693
- Come on!
- Why do we have to leave the bus?

775
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:10,611
Come on. Don't ask so many questions.

776
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:12,412
Why?

777
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:21,747
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't
have frightened him like that.

778
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:25,418
At the rate he's going, he's probably
crossed two state lines by this time.

779
00:52:25,518 --> 00:52:29,171
Say, why did we have
to leave the bus?

780
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:33,426
When Shapeley stops running,
he's going to start thinking, isn't he?

781
00:52:33,526 --> 00:52:37,555
You know, I've been doing
a little thinking myself.

782
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:40,725
The next town we come to,
you better wire your father.

783
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:42,977
What's the matter? Are you weakening?

784
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,521
No. No, just thinking of you.

785
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:47,648
A starvation diet may
not agree with you.

786
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:50,067
Did you give that
child all your money?

787
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,778
I didn't give him anything.
You were the bighearted gal.

788
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,114
All the money I had
was that ten-spot...

789
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:58,492
so I've been thinking you
better wire your father.

790
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,244
No, sir.

791
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:02,622
I started out for New York,
and I'm going to get there...

792
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:06,417
- if I have to starve all the way.
- Okay.

793
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:08,627
What is this strange power...

794
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:11,255
this man Westley has over you women?

795
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,340
Here. Take these.

796
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,760
Hold on to them. Get up on that log.

797
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,227
Get up on the log.

798
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:30,316
I wish you'd stop being playful.

799
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:32,610
Oh, so sorry. Sorry.

800
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:36,030
This is the first time in years
I've ridden piggyback.

801
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:38,532
- This isn't piggyback.
- Of course it is.

802
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,534
You're crazy.

803
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:44,371
I remember distinctly my father
taking me for a piggyback ride.

804
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,582
- And he carried you like this?
- Yes.

805
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:49,543
Your father didn't know beans
about piggyback riding.

806
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:52,296
My uncle, Mother's brother,
has four children...

807
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,089
and I've seen them ride piggyback.

808
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:57,259
I'll bet there isn't a good
piggyback rider in your family.

809
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,763
I never knew a rich man yet
who could piggyback ride.

810
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:03,349
You're prejudiced.

811
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:06,477
Show me a good piggybacker,
and I'll show you a real human.

812
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:09,522
Take Abraham Lincoln:
a natural born piggybacker.

813
00:54:09,622 --> 00:54:12,949
Where do you get off with that
stuffed-shirt family of yours?

814
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:18,037
My father was a great piggybacker.

815
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:21,082
Here, hold this a minute.

816
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,670
- Oh!
- Thank you.

817
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:34,637
How long does this keep up?
My feet are killing me.

818
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:50,646
This looks like the best spot.

819
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:53,357
We're not going to sleep
out here, are we?

820
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:56,193
I'm going to give a
good imitation of it.

821
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,612
Peter?

822
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,447
What?

823
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,408
I'm awfully hungry.

824
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:05,870
- Oh, it's just your imagination.
- No, it isn't.

825
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,789
I'm hungry and... and scared.

826
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:11,750
You can't be hungry and
scared both at the same time.

827
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,468
- Well, I am.
- If you're scared,

828
00:55:13,569 --> 00:55:18,173
- it scares the hunger out of you.
- Not if you're more hungry than scared.

829
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:20,050
All right, you win.

830
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,351
Let's forget about it.

831
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:26,390
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.

832
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,517
Holy smoke!

833
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:31,478
Why did I ever get mixed up with you?

834
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:34,857
If I had any sense, I'd be
in New York by this time.

835
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:36,650
What about your story?

836
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,570
Taking a married woman
back to her husband.

837
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,458
I turned out to be the prize sucker.

838
00:55:47,136 --> 00:55:50,129
All right, come on.
Your bed's all ready.

839
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:52,958
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.

840
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,793
- Then take 'em off.
- What?

841
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,463
All right, don't.
Do whatever you please...

842
00:55:57,563 --> 00:55:59,722
but shut up about it.

843
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:32,790
You know, you're becoming
awfully disagreeable lately.

844
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:36,759
You just snap my head off
every time I open my mouth.

845
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:42,682
If being with me is so distasteful
to you, you can leave.

846
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:47,513
You can leave anytime you see fit.

847
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:49,855
Nobody's holding you here.

848
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:53,526
I can get along.

849
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,825
Peter?

850
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,030
Peter!

851
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,617
Oh, Peter! Peter!

852
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,661
Peter! Peter!

853
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:12,746
Peter! Oh, Peter!

854
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,915
- What's the matter?
- I was so scared!

855
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:18,752
What got into you? I went to try
and find you something to eat.

856
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,879
- I know, but...
- Here.

857
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,882
- Here, eat your head off.
- I don't want it now.

858
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,760
- I thought you said you were hungry.
- I was, but...

859
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,637
But what?

860
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:30,848
I was so scared,
it scared the hung...

861
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:34,191
Holy jumpin' catfish!
You'd drive a guy crazy!

862
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:20,404
It's liable to get chilly before
morning. You better use this.

863
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,110
What are you thinking about?

864
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:03,607
By a strange coincidence,
I was thinking of you.

865
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,651
Really?

866
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:08,028
Yeah.

867
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:11,831
I was just wondering what makes
dames like you so dizzy.

868
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:48,402
What did you say we're
supposed to be doing?

869
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:50,154
Hitchhiking.

870
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:51,947
Oh.

871
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:55,784
Well, you've given me a very
good example of the hiking.

872
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:58,078
Where does the hitching come in?

873
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:00,796
A little early yet. No cars out.

874
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:06,170
If it's just the same to you...

875
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:09,722
I'm going to sit right here
and wait till they come.

876
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:21,768
Ooh. You got a toothpick?

877
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,605
- What's the matter?
- Got hay in my teeth.

878
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:28,400
No, I haven't got a toothpick.
Here. I got a penknife, though.

879
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,320
- Hold still.
- Be careful.

880
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,363
- Where is it?
- Right in the middle.

881
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,490
The middle? All right. Hold still.

882
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:38,035
Real still. All right. There.

883
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:41,246
- Get it?
- Thanks.

884
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:44,625
You should've swallowed that.
You're not gonna have breakfast.

885
01:00:44,725 --> 01:00:46,967
Oh, you needn't rub it in.

886
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:53,467
- What are you eating?
- Carrots.

887
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:55,802
- Raw?
- Want one?

888
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,804
No!

889
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,307
Why didn't you get me
something I could eat?

890
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:04,811
Oh, that's right. I forgot. The idea of
offering a raw carrot to an Andrews.

891
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:07,856
You don't think I'm going around
panhandling for you, do you?

892
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:10,651
Better have one of these.
Best thing for you, carrots.

893
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:12,877
I hate the horrid things.

894
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:18,450
I wish you wouldn't talk so much.
We let a car get away.

895
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:21,078
So suppose nobody stops for us?

896
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:24,581
They'll stop, all right. It's a
matter of knowing how to hail 'em.

897
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,583
Oh, and you're an expert, I suppose.

898
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,794
"Expert"? I'm gonna
write a book about it.

899
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:30,921
Call it The Hitchhiker's Hail.

900
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:33,840
There's no end to your
accomplishments, is there?

901
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,968
- You think it's simple?
- Oh, no.

902
01:01:36,068 --> 01:01:38,971
It is simple. It's all
in that old thumb, see?

903
01:01:39,071 --> 01:01:41,014
Some people do it like this...

904
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,016
or like this.

905
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:46,311
- All wrong. Never get anywhere.
- Aw, the poor things.

906
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:48,480
But that old thumb never fails.

907
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,608
It's all a matter of
how you do it, though.

908
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,610
You take number one, for instance.

909
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,862
That's a short, jerky
movement, like this.

910
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:59,491
Shows independence. You don't care
whether they stop. You got money.

911
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:01,034
Clever.

912
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:05,546
Number two's a wider movement.
A smile goes with this one, like this.

913
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:10,168
That means you got a brand-new
story about the farmer's daughter.

914
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:13,839
You figured that out all by yourself?

915
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:16,758
That's nothing.
Number three is a pip.

916
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:20,470
That's the pitiful one, when you're broke
and hungry, and everything looks black.

917
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:23,480
It's a long, sweeping movement.
Got to follow through, though.

918
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:26,727
That's amazing.

919
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:29,604
But it's no good if you
haven't got a long face.

920
01:02:30,404 --> 01:02:31,681
Here comes a car.

921
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:33,984
Okay, watch me.
I'm gonna use number one.

922
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:36,827
Keep your eye on that thumb
and see what happens.

923
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:45,787
I still got my eye on the thumb.

924
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,832
Something must have gone wrong.
I'll try number two.

925
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:52,134
Well, when you get to
a hundred, wake me up.

926
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,878
I don't think I'll write
that book after all.

927
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:38,006
Think of all the fun you had, though.

928
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:40,883
Do you mind if I try?

929
01:03:41,902 --> 01:03:43,470
You?

930
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,890
Don't make me laugh.

931
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:51,478
Oh, you're such a smart aleck.
Nobody knows anything but you.

932
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:54,398
I'll stop a car, and I
won't use my thumb.

933
01:03:55,098 --> 01:03:59,610
- What are you gonna do?
- It's a system all my own.

934
01:04:19,481 --> 01:04:22,300
Aren't you going to give
me a little credit?

935
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,177
What for?

936
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,346
Well, I proved once and for all...

937
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:29,349
that the limb is mightier
than the thumb.

938
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:32,978
Why didn't you take off all your clothes?
You could have stopped 40 cars.

939
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:35,805
Ooh, I'll remember that
when we need 40 cars.

940
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:40,193
So you're just married?
That's pretty good.

941
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,320
But if I was young...

942
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,115
that's the way I'd spend
my honeymoon: hitchhiking.

943
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:46,908
- Yeah.
- Yes, sir.

944
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:50,871
Hitchhiking down the highway of love

945
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:54,208
On a honeymoon

946
01:04:54,308 --> 01:04:58,545
Hitchhiking down, down

947
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:03,467
Down the highway

948
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:07,262
Down

949
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:09,222
- Down...
- Hey, hey.

950
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:11,475
Aren't you afraid you'll
burn out a tonsil?

951
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:13,817
Tonsil? Me? No.

952
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:16,980
Me, burn a tonsil!

953
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,609
My tonsils won't burn
as life's corners I...

954
01:05:20,709 --> 01:05:22,986
All right, all right. Let it go.

955
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:25,162
Turn

956
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:35,040
How about a bite to eat?

957
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,751
- That would be lovely.
- No, thanks. We're not hungry.

958
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:40,107
Oh, I see. Young people
in love are never hungry.

959
01:05:40,208 --> 01:05:43,882
- No.
- Young people in love

960
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:48,053
Are very seldom hungry

961
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:51,723
Young people in love are very seldom

962
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:54,267
Hungry

963
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:58,146
What were you going to do,
gold-dig that guy for a meal?

964
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:01,191
Sure, I was. No fooling: I'm hungry.

965
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,568
Eat a carrot.

966
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:05,654
No.

967
01:06:05,754 --> 01:06:09,706
- I'm going in and asking him.
- You do and I'll break your neck.

968
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:24,304
Come on, let's get out
of here. Stretch our legs.

969
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:30,352
Come on.

970
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:52,659
I'm sorry I...

971
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:55,460
Oh, that's all right.

972
01:07:04,813 --> 01:07:07,048
Hey! Hey!

973
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:09,050
Hey, come here!

974
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:12,262
Hey, you've got my suitcase! Hey!

975
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:14,229
Hey, you!

976
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:17,232
Hey! Hey!

977
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,619
What happened to you?
I've been so worried.

978
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:37,954
- Get in.
- Look at your face! You've got a cut!

979
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:40,874
- What happened?
- Just a road thief.

980
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:43,575
Picks people up, then runs off
with their things. What a racket!

981
01:07:43,676 --> 01:07:46,427
- How'd you get the car?
- Gave him a black eye.

982
01:07:46,528 --> 01:07:48,797
Had to tie him to a tree.

983
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:22,791
Can't be much gas left in this thing.

984
01:08:22,891 --> 01:08:25,092
Got to start promoting some.

985
01:08:26,978 --> 01:08:30,340
Better take the things out
of the pocket of that coat.

986
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,975
That ought to be good for 10 gallons.

987
01:09:08,311 --> 01:09:11,673
I haven't changed my mind, Westley.
I want you to understand that.

988
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:14,050
I don't like you.
Never have, never will.

989
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,177
That's clear enough, isn't it?

990
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,847
You've made that evident by
your threats of annulment.

991
01:09:18,947 --> 01:09:20,932
It hasn't worried me for a minute.

992
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:23,309
Ellie and I married because
we love each other.

993
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,019
And she's proving it.

994
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,689
As far as I'm concerned,
there's to be no annulment.

995
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:30,817
I see. You've got hold
of a good thing...

996
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:33,862
and you're going to hang on to it?

997
01:09:33,962 --> 01:09:35,822
All right. You win.

998
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:38,700
I guess I'll just have
to get used to you.

999
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,076
I admit I'm licked...

1000
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,662
but it's only because I'm worried.

1001
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:46,708
If I don't find her soon,
I'll go crazy.

1002
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:50,003
I might've been able to help
if it hadn't been for you.

1003
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:54,340
- I've been watched so closely...
- Yes, I know. Well, you can help now.

1004
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,051
I've got a room full
of reporters in there.

1005
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:59,304
Now I want you to make a statement.

1006
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:03,308
Say that we've talked things over
and come to an understanding...

1007
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:07,569
and that if she returns, I won't
interfere with your marriage.

1008
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:20,575
- Is that all right?
- Yeah, that's quite all right.

1009
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:22,657
- Okay.
- I hope you and your wife

1010
01:10:22,758 --> 01:10:26,250
- spend a pleasant week with us.
- Yeah, so do I. Thank you.

1011
01:10:26,351 --> 01:10:29,007
- Good night.
- Good night.

1012
01:10:30,894 --> 01:10:32,712
- All right, brat.
- Any luck?

1013
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:35,548
Yeah. He finally agreed
to let us have a cabin.

1014
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:38,551
- What about the money?
- I talked him out of that idea.

1015
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:42,388
He thinks we're staying a week. I'll have
to think something up before morning.

1016
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:46,184
- That's swell.
- Yeah? I'm glad you think so.

1017
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:48,311
If you ask me, I think it's foolish.

1018
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:51,231
I told you there's no use
staying here tonight.

1019
01:10:51,331 --> 01:10:53,824
We could make New
York in three hours.

1020
01:10:57,128 --> 01:11:00,114
I thought you were in
such a hurry to get back.

1021
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:01,998
Well, I...

1022
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:08,873
Well, whoever heard of getting
in at 3:00 in the morning?

1023
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:11,716
Everybody will be asleep.

1024
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:18,258
Okay.

1025
01:11:18,358 --> 01:11:20,392
Cottage number six.

1026
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,246
There you go, trusting people again.

1027
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:50,290
How many times did I tell you...

1028
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:54,176
But he looked like a nice,
upright young fellow, Ma.

1029
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,350
Well, we're on the last lap.

1030
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:09,183
Tomorrow morning, you'll be
in the arms of your husband.

1031
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:11,026
Yeah.

1032
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:14,480
You'll have a great story, won't you?

1033
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,816
Yeah.

1034
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:18,783
Swell.

1035
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:41,890
Thank you.

1036
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:19,010
Well, we certainly
outsmarted your father.

1037
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:22,430
I guess you ought to be happy.

1038
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:25,809
Am I going to see you in New York?

1039
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:29,771
Nope.

1040
01:13:31,324 --> 01:13:33,559
Why not?

1041
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:37,529
I don't make it a policy to run
around with married women.

1042
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:42,117
There's no harm in
your coming to see us.

1043
01:13:43,211 --> 01:13:44,995
Not interested.

1044
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:50,159
Won't I ever see you again?

1045
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:53,371
What do you want to see me for?
I've served my purpose.

1046
01:13:53,471 --> 01:13:56,548
I brought you back to King Westley.
That's what you wanted.

1047
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:35,628
Have you ever been in love, Peter?

1048
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:38,923
Me?

1049
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:41,634
Yes.

1050
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:45,555
Haven't you ever thought
about it at all?

1051
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:51,770
It seems to me you could make
some girl wonderfully happy.

1052
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:55,683
Sure, I've thought about it.

1053
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:57,942
Who hasn't?

1054
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:04,025
If I could ever meet
the right sort of girl...

1055
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:06,527
Yeah, well, where are
you gonna find her?

1056
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:08,988
Somebody that's real.
Somebody that's alive.

1057
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:11,289
They don't come that way anymore.

1058
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:18,421
Have I ever thought about it?

1059
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:23,176
Boy, I've even been sucker
enough to make plans.

1060
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,299
You know...

1061
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:31,385
I saw an island in the Pacific once.

1062
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:33,686
Never been able to forget it.

1063
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:38,650
That's where I'd like to take her.

1064
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:43,523
But she'd have to be
the sort of girl who...

1065
01:15:43,623 --> 01:15:48,284
who'd jump in the surf with me
and love it as much as I did.

1066
01:15:49,921 --> 01:15:52,949
You know...

1067
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,409
nights when you and the moon...

1068
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:58,037
and the water all become one...

1069
01:15:58,137 --> 01:16:02,257
and you feel you're part of
something big and marvelous.

1070
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:07,922
That's the only place to live.

1071
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:10,341
The stars are so close
over your head...

1072
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:13,685
you feel you could reach
up and stir them around.

1073
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:21,568
Certainly I've been
thinking about it.

1074
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:26,448
Boy, if I could ever find a girl
who was hungry for those thi...

1075
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:37,201
Take me with you, Peter.
Take me to your island.

1076
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:40,830
I want to do all those
things you talked about.

1077
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:43,958
You'd better go back to your bed.

1078
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:46,586
I love you. Nothing else matters.

1079
01:16:46,686 --> 01:16:50,298
We can run away.
Everything will take care of itself.

1080
01:16:50,398 --> 01:16:52,091
Please, Peter.

1081
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:55,720
I can't let you out of my life now.

1082
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:57,930
I couldn't live without you.

1083
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:14,329
You'd better go back to your bed.

1084
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:25,256
I'm sorry.

1085
01:18:01,052 --> 01:18:03,829
Hey, brat.

1086
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:06,631
Did you mean that?
Would you really go?

1087
01:18:46,472 --> 01:18:49,709
All I'm asking is enough
gas to get me to New York.

1088
01:18:49,809 --> 01:18:51,585
That bag's worth $25.

1089
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:54,714
I got a bag. My wife gave
me one for Christmas.

1090
01:18:54,814 --> 01:18:58,009
When I get back in the
morning, I'll buy it back.

1091
01:18:58,109 --> 01:19:00,553
Give you a $10 profit.
What do you say?

1092
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:02,722
- I ain't got a hat.
- What?

1093
01:19:02,822 --> 01:19:04,557
I ain't got a hat.

1094
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:07,775
You got one now!
Come on, fill 'er up.

1095
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,527
Peter, where you been all this time?

1096
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:19,405
- Everybody been asking about you.
- Okay, Tony. Look.

1097
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:21,907
Get me one drink.
Don't let anybody disturb me.

1098
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,708
Sure, boss.

1099
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:28,748
- Hello, Agnes.
- Don't go in. He'll shoot you on sight.

1100
01:19:28,848 --> 01:19:30,750
Haven't been shot at in days.

1101
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:32,752
Get out of here! Get out!

1102
01:19:32,852 --> 01:19:34,545
- Get out!
- Listen, Joe.

1103
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:36,797
- Don't "Joe" me.
- Joe, listen.

1104
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:38,716
You know I've always liked you.

1105
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:42,595
Anytime I ran across a good story,
I came running to you with it.

1106
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:46,349
I got one now. Those wires were on the
level. The biggest scoop of the year!

1107
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:48,642
- I'm giving it to you.
- About the Andrews kid?

1108
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:51,729
I've got it written up.
All I want is a thousand bucks.

1109
01:19:51,829 --> 01:19:53,147
A thousand bucks? Get out...

1110
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:56,442
Don't get sore. This is
something you gotta do for me.

1111
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:59,820
- I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
- What's the thousand bucks for?

1112
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,947
- To tear down the walls of Jericho.
- What?

1113
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:05,451
Never mind. Andrews is going
to have her marriage annulled.

1114
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:07,758
- To marry somebody else.
- You're drunk.

1115
01:20:07,859 --> 01:20:09,789
Would that story be
worth a thousand bucks?

1116
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:12,674
- If it was on the level.
- I got it, Joe.

1117
01:20:15,102 --> 01:20:18,096
- Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
- I am, Joe.

1118
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:21,467
- You?
- Yeah.

1119
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:24,720
Now I know you're drunk. I'm going
home. Don't annoy me anymore.

1120
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:27,473
For heaven's sake, stop being
an editor for a minute.

1121
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:31,310
We've known each other a
long time. This is on the level.

1122
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:34,939
I met her on a bus from Miami.
I've been with her every minute.

1123
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:38,317
I'm in love with her. You got
to get me this money now.

1124
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:41,028
She's waiting for me in an auto
camp outside Philadelphia.

1125
01:20:41,128 --> 01:20:43,823
I gotta get right back.
She doesn't know I'm gone.

1126
01:20:43,923 --> 01:20:47,701
A guy can't propose to a gal without
a cent in the world, can he?

1127
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:49,495
What a story.

1128
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:52,123
On her way to join her husband,
Ellen Andrews...

1129
01:20:52,223 --> 01:20:54,090
That's it, that's it.

1130
01:20:55,309 --> 01:20:57,635
Let me see that a minute.

1131
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:01,882
Zeke? Zeke!

1132
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:04,009
Zeke!

1133
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:06,512
I told you you couldn't trust him.

1134
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:08,472
- He's gone.
- Who?

1135
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:12,685
That fellow who was gonna stay a week.
He skipped and took the car too.

1136
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:16,355
We wouldn't have known till morning
if I hadn't took that magnesia. Get up.

1137
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:18,941
Don't lay there.
Let's do something about it.

1138
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:22,153
There ain't nothing we
can do if he's gone.

1139
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:39,795
- See that? They're gone.
- Looks like it, don't it?

1140
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,047
What's this?

1141
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:44,216
Ma, here's the woman.

1142
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:46,093
- Oh!
- What's the matter?

1143
01:21:46,193 --> 01:21:48,512
- Where's your husband?
- "Husband"?

1144
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:50,813
Yes, if he is your husband.

1145
01:21:52,575 --> 01:21:55,686
- Isn't he here?
- No, he ain't. The car's gone too.

1146
01:21:55,786 --> 01:21:57,605
Oh.

1147
01:21:57,705 --> 01:21:59,940
You got any money?

1148
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,734
- No.
- Then you'll have to git.

1149
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:04,160
Yeah, you'll have to git.

1150
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:09,325
Please, may I use your phone?
I've got to call New York.

1151
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:11,744
You ain't gonna stick
me for no phone call.

1152
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:15,963
Go to the sheriff's office, a quarter
mile down the road. They'll fix you up.

1153
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:20,384
And listen, next time you
better not come back here.

1154
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:22,804
I run a respectable place.

1155
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:28,594
- Thanks. You saved my life.
- So long, kid.

1156
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:30,679
- Good luck.
- Thanks. Good-bye, Agnes.

1157
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:33,891
Oh, you're beautiful!
All women are beautiful.

1158
01:22:33,991 --> 01:22:37,269
For my dough, he's still the best
newspaperman in the business.

1159
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:40,564
- Get Hank, quick. Boy, what a yarn!
- Hello?

1160
01:22:40,664 --> 01:22:43,275
Hold up the morning edition.
Break down the front page.

1161
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:46,529
Complete new layout.
Send in a couple rewrite men.

1162
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:50,658
Hank, don't do a thing. I've got a
story that will make your hair curl.

1163
01:22:50,758 --> 01:22:52,910
Wait a minute.
Don't annoy me. I'm busy.

1164
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:57,373
Agnes, send Mac in here! Dig up all
the pictures on that Andrews kid.

1165
01:22:57,473 --> 01:23:00,209
And Hank, get Healy out of bed.

1166
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:02,795
I want a cartoon,
and I want it quick.

1167
01:23:02,895 --> 01:23:05,089
King Westley's in it,
waiting at the church...

1168
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:07,007
with tears streaming down his face.

1169
01:23:07,107 --> 01:23:09,802
The bride didn't show up.
Old man Andrews is laughing.

1170
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:12,221
Everything exaggerated. Snap into it.

1171
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:14,480
Yeah, what is it? Huh?

1172
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:18,769
Ellen Andrews? You're crazy.

1173
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:23,023
No, I'm not. She phoned her father
from an auto camp to come get her.

1174
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:25,693
He's getting a police escort,
and Westley's going along.

1175
01:23:25,793 --> 01:23:27,861
Yeah, she's been traveling by bus.

1176
01:23:27,961 --> 01:23:31,240
The moment she found out her father
and Westley made up, she phoned.

1177
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:33,951
Okay, grab a car and stay with them.

1178
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:36,245
Get Hank again. Agnes!

1179
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:38,872
Get me a doctor. I'm gonna
have a nervous breakdown.

1180
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:42,167
Hank, forget what I told you.
I'm having a nightmare. Agnes!

1181
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:44,545
Call the police.
Tell them to find Peter Warne.

1182
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:47,548
Send out a general alarm.
I want that dirty crook pinched!

1183
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:49,967
- Do you want us?
- Everything off the front page!

1184
01:23:50,067 --> 01:23:52,428
Ellen Andrews just phoned
her father. She's going home.

1185
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:56,348
The minute she found out the old man withdrew
his objections, she gave herself up.

1186
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:59,226
Spread it all over! Play it
up big! Here's your lead:

1187
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:03,272
- "Love Triumphant." Go on, hop to it!
- Okay.

1188
01:24:17,845 --> 01:24:19,538
Come on, baby. Come on.

1189
01:24:19,638 --> 01:24:22,791
We gotta get there
before she wakes up.

1190
01:24:32,109 --> 01:24:34,936
Can't you drive any faster?

1191
01:24:37,656 --> 01:24:40,434
Young people in love

1192
01:24:40,534 --> 01:24:43,395
Are never hungry

1193
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:55,873
Come on, baby!
We've got a police escort.

1194
01:25:06,685 --> 01:25:10,346
Come on, baby. They can't
make a sucker out of us.

1195
01:25:14,193 --> 01:25:16,428
- Get back.
- Get 'em back.

1196
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:20,099
Step back. Give 'em room, boys.

1197
01:25:20,199 --> 01:25:23,268
- Quite a long trip, isn't it?
- How about a statement?

1198
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:27,363
Wait till she gets home.
Later, boys. Later.

1199
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:40,244
Oh, he floats through the air
with the greatest of ease

1200
01:25:40,344 --> 01:25:43,747
The daring young man
on the flying trapeze

1201
01:25:54,357 --> 01:25:55,469
Hiya!

1202
01:25:58,569 --> 01:26:00,305
Hey, get that thing out of the way!

1203
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:04,525
Keep your britches on!
We'll get it out of the way.

1204
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:08,397
Hiya!

1205
01:26:26,974 --> 01:26:28,799
Hey, you darn fool!

1206
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:39,060
Hey!

1207
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:38,702
Hey, Pete, Ellen Andrews is going
to marry that Westley guy again.

1208
01:27:47,054 --> 01:27:50,582
- Gordon's out back someplace.
- Yeah?

1209
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:54,552
When he comes in, give him this.
Tell him I was just kidding.

1210
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:59,591
- You can't get a thing done around here.
- Peter Warne was just in.

1211
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:01,153
- What?
- He left this money.

1212
01:28:01,254 --> 01:28:03,583
- Said to tell you he was kidding.
- Where is he?

1213
01:28:03,684 --> 01:28:06,038
- There.
- Hey, Pete!

1214
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:10,185
Hello, Joe.

1215
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:14,106
Sorry. It was just a little gag.
I thought I'd have some fun with you.

1216
01:28:14,206 --> 01:28:16,775
Yeah, sure. You had
me going for a while.

1217
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:19,945
- Wouldn't have made a bad story.
- No. Great.

1218
01:28:20,045 --> 01:28:23,657
But that's the way things go.
You think you got a great yarn...

1219
01:28:23,757 --> 01:28:26,910
and then something comes along
and messes up the finish...

1220
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:28,787
and there you are.

1221
01:28:28,887 --> 01:28:31,964
Yeah. Where am I?

1222
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:39,930
When you sober up,
come in and talk to me.

1223
01:28:41,024 --> 01:28:42,766
Thanks.

1224
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:10,412
- Ellie?
- Oh, hello, Dad.

1225
01:29:10,512 --> 01:29:13,248
I knocked several times.

1226
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:15,834
I'm sorry. I must have
been daydreaming.

1227
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:18,170
Well, everything's set.

1228
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:20,464
Creating quite a furor too.

1229
01:29:20,564 --> 01:29:23,342
Great stunt King is going to pull.

1230
01:29:23,442 --> 01:29:27,095
- "Stunt"?
- Yes, landing on the lawn in an autogyro.

1231
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:29,014
Oh. Oh, yes.

1232
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:31,642
Yes, I heard.

1233
01:29:31,742 --> 01:29:34,561
Yes, personally,
I think it's silly too.

1234
01:29:34,661 --> 01:29:36,730
You look lovely, child.

1235
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:39,031
Are you pleased with the gown?

1236
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:43,028
Ellie?

1237
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:44,905
Oh, the gown.

1238
01:29:45,005 --> 01:29:47,498
Yes, it's nice, isn't it?

1239
01:29:52,596 --> 01:29:54,880
What's the matter, child?

1240
01:29:57,476 --> 01:30:00,379
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1241
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:02,756
You haven't changed your
mind about King, have you?

1242
01:30:02,856 --> 01:30:04,800
Oh, no, no.

1243
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:09,304
Because if you have, it isn't too late.
You know how I feel about him.

1244
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:12,599
You gave me such a scare
when I couldn't find you.

1245
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:15,852
You know, the old pump
isn't what it used to be.

1246
01:30:15,952 --> 01:30:19,022
I'm sorry, Father.
I wouldn't hurt you for anything.

1247
01:30:19,122 --> 01:30:20,899
You know that.

1248
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:23,902
What's the matter, child?

1249
01:30:24,002 --> 01:30:25,696
Aren't you happy?

1250
01:30:28,507 --> 01:30:30,701
I thought so.

1251
01:30:30,801 --> 01:30:33,495
I knew there was
something on your mind.

1252
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:37,339
There, there, there, now.

1253
01:30:39,476 --> 01:30:41,878
What's the matter?

1254
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:45,723
You haven't fallen in love
with someone else, have you?

1255
01:30:47,901 --> 01:30:49,727
Have you?

1256
01:30:52,781 --> 01:30:55,858
I haven't seen you cry
since you were a baby.

1257
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:58,902
This must be serious.

1258
01:31:00,372 --> 01:31:02,573
Where'd you meet him?

1259
01:31:03,917 --> 01:31:05,569
On the road.

1260
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:08,613
Don't tell me you've fallen
in love with a bus driver.

1261
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:10,914
Oh, no.

1262
01:31:14,636 --> 01:31:16,378
Who is he?

1263
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:20,375
I don't know very much about him...

1264
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:22,502
except that I love him.

1265
01:31:22,602 --> 01:31:26,173
Well, if it's as serious as all that,
we'll move heaven and earth...

1266
01:31:26,273 --> 01:31:29,301
No, it's no use. He despises me.

1267
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:31,636
- Oh, come, now!
- Yes, he does.

1268
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:34,306
He despises everything about me.

1269
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:37,184
He says that I'm
spoiled and selfish...

1270
01:31:37,284 --> 01:31:40,103
and pampered and
thoroughly insincere.

1271
01:31:40,203 --> 01:31:42,397
Oh, ridiculous!

1272
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:44,816
He doesn't think so
much of you either.

1273
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:46,485
Well, I...

1274
01:31:46,585 --> 01:31:49,404
He blames you for everything
that's wrong with me.

1275
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:52,157
He says you raised me stupidly.

1276
01:31:52,257 --> 01:31:55,410
That's a fine man
to fall in love with!

1277
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:57,454
Oh, he's marvelous.

1278
01:31:57,554 --> 01:32:00,040
Well, what are we
going to do about it?

1279
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:02,000
Where is he?

1280
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:04,669
- I don't know.
- I'd like to talk with him.

1281
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:06,922
It wouldn't do any good.

1282
01:32:07,022 --> 01:32:09,925
I practically threw myself at him.

1283
01:32:10,025 --> 01:32:13,678
Under the circumstances, don't you
think we'd better call this thing off?

1284
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:16,681
No, no. No, I'll go through with it.

1285
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:19,851
But that's silly, seeing the
way you feel about him.

1286
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:23,271
No, it doesn't matter. I don't
want to stir up any more trouble.

1287
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:25,607
I've done it all my life.

1288
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:29,986
I've made your life miserable,
and mine too.

1289
01:32:30,086 --> 01:32:32,614
I'm tired, Father.

1290
01:32:32,714 --> 01:32:36,118
I'm tired of running
around in circles.

1291
01:32:36,218 --> 01:32:39,962
He's right. That's what I've been
doing ever since I can remember.

1292
01:32:40,764 --> 01:32:43,375
I've got to settle down.

1293
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:46,844
It doesn't matter how
or where or with whom.

1294
01:32:48,188 --> 01:32:50,882
You've changed, Ellie.

1295
01:32:50,982 --> 01:32:53,343
I can't walk out on King now.

1296
01:32:53,443 --> 01:32:56,019
It would make us all
look so ridiculous.

1297
01:32:57,155 --> 01:33:01,393
Anyway, what difference does it make?

1298
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:03,603
I'll never see Peter again.

1299
01:33:03,703 --> 01:33:06,148
Is that his name?

1300
01:33:06,248 --> 01:33:08,991
Yes. Peter Warne.

1301
01:33:10,168 --> 01:33:12,244
"Peter Warne."

1302
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:18,160
- Why? Do you know him?
- Why, no, no.

1303
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:20,704
Father, you haven't heard
from him, have you?

1304
01:33:20,804 --> 01:33:22,914
- Don't be silly...
- Oh, please!

1305
01:33:23,014 --> 01:33:24,840
What's that?

1306
01:33:36,987 --> 01:33:40,432
Well, I guess that was his only
interest in me, wasn't it?

1307
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:42,100
The reward.

1308
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:45,020
- I'm sorry you read it.
- Are you going to see him?

1309
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,189
I suppose so.

1310
01:33:47,289 --> 01:33:49,941
Certainly! Pay him off!

1311
01:33:50,041 --> 01:33:52,611
He's entitled to it.
He did an excellent job.

1312
01:33:52,711 --> 01:33:57,199
He kept me thoroughly entertained.
It's worth every penny he gets.

1313
01:33:57,299 --> 01:33:59,534
Thank you, Mary.
That's just what I needed.

1314
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:02,245
Mr. Westley's on his way up.

1315
01:34:02,345 --> 01:34:04,546
Fine. Have him come in.

1316
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:12,763
I'll be going.

1317
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:17,476
Oh.

1318
01:34:23,742 --> 01:34:27,145
If it isn't the bridegroom himself!
You're just in time, King.

1319
01:34:27,245 --> 01:34:29,231
How are you, Ellie?

1320
01:34:29,331 --> 01:34:31,066
- Are you happy?
- "Happy"?

1321
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:33,401
Why shouldn't I be happy?

1322
01:34:33,501 --> 01:34:36,780
Here we are. Let's drink.
Well, it's up to you now.

1323
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:40,700
I want our life to be full of excitement.
We'll never let up, will we?

1324
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,577
Never a dull moment.

1325
01:34:42,677 --> 01:34:45,330
We'll get on a merry-go-round
and never get off.

1326
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:48,583
- Promise you'll never let me get off.
- Whatever you say, darling.

1327
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:50,634
It's a promise.

1328
01:35:04,407 --> 01:35:07,519
Hello. Yeah?

1329
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:10,522
Who? Oh.

1330
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:12,816
Why can't I see you at your office?

1331
01:35:12,916 --> 01:35:16,569
I'm leaving for Washington tonight.
I may be gone several weeks.

1332
01:35:16,669 --> 01:35:19,781
I thought perhaps you'd like
to get this thing settled.

1333
01:35:19,881 --> 01:35:23,243
Yeah. But I don't like the idea
of butting in on your jamboree.

1334
01:35:23,343 --> 01:35:26,162
Between you and me,
those things give me a stiff pain.

1335
01:35:26,262 --> 01:35:29,624
You don't have to see anybody.
You can come directly to my study.

1336
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:32,384
No, no, no. Why do I want to...

1337
01:35:35,397 --> 01:35:37,215
Hey, wait a minute.

1338
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:39,968
Maybe I will come over. Yeah.

1339
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:43,096
I'd like to get a load of that
three-ring circus you're pulling.

1340
01:35:43,196 --> 01:35:46,016
I want to see what love looks
like when it's triumphant.

1341
01:35:46,116 --> 01:35:48,609
I haven't had a good laugh in a week.

1342
01:35:50,787 --> 01:35:53,363
- Mr. Warne?
- Yeah.

1343
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,611
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

1344
01:35:58,711 --> 01:36:02,365
I was surprised to get your note.
My daughter hadn't told me...

1345
01:36:02,465 --> 01:36:04,492
anything about you,
about your helping her.

1346
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:07,245
That's typical of your daughter.
Takes those things for granted.

1347
01:36:07,345 --> 01:36:10,498
Why did she think I lugged
her all the way from Miami?

1348
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:13,418
She thinks you're entitled
to anything you can get.

1349
01:36:13,518 --> 01:36:16,379
She does? Isn't that sweet of her?

1350
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:19,507
- You don't, I suppose.
- Well, I don't know.

1351
01:36:19,607 --> 01:36:22,302
I'll have to see on what
you base your claim.

1352
01:36:22,402 --> 01:36:24,429
I presume you feel justified.

1353
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:28,065
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.
I got it all itemized.

1354
01:36:30,452 --> 01:36:33,646
"Cash outlay: $8.60.

1355
01:36:33,746 --> 01:36:37,108
Topcoat: $15. Suitcase: $7.50.

1356
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:40,744
Hat: $4.00. Three shirts: $4.50.

1357
01:36:41,546 --> 01:36:44,657
Total: $39.60.

1358
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:47,869
All the above items had to
be sold to buy gasoline."

1359
01:36:47,969 --> 01:36:51,164
I sold some shorts and socks too.
I'm throwing those in.

1360
01:36:51,264 --> 01:36:54,501
- Yes, I know.
- What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough?

1361
01:36:54,601 --> 01:36:57,629
Trip like that would cost you a
thousand dollars, maybe more.

1362
01:36:57,729 --> 01:37:00,465
Let me get this straight.
You want 39.60...

1363
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:02,717
in addition to the $10,000?

1364
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:04,969
What 10,000?

1365
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:08,932
- The reward.
- Who said anything about a reward?

1366
01:37:09,032 --> 01:37:11,726
I'm afraid I'm a little bit confused.

1367
01:37:11,826 --> 01:37:14,687
- I assumed that...
- Look, all I want is 39.60.

1368
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:17,899
If you give me a check,
I'll get out of this joint.

1369
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:19,984
It gives me the jitters.

1370
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:23,071
- You're a peculiar chap.
- We'll go into that some other time.

1371
01:37:23,171 --> 01:37:25,990
The average man would
go after the reward...

1372
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:28,618
Did anybody ever make
a sucker out of you?

1373
01:37:28,718 --> 01:37:31,579
This is a matter of principle, something
you probably wouldn't understand.

1374
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:35,567
When anybody takes me for a buggy ride,
I don't like having to pay for the privilege.

1375
01:37:35,667 --> 01:37:39,712
- Were you taken for a buggy ride?
- Yes, with all the trimmings.

1376
01:37:39,812 --> 01:37:42,924
- So how about the check? Do I get it?
- Certainly.

1377
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:44,975
Thanks.

1378
01:37:58,581 --> 01:38:02,277
- There you are.
- Thank you.

1379
01:38:02,377 --> 01:38:05,989
Do you mind if I ask you
a question, frankly?

1380
01:38:06,089 --> 01:38:08,331
Do you love my daughter?

1381
01:38:09,717 --> 01:38:13,121
Any guy in love with your daughter
oughta have his head examined.

1382
01:38:13,221 --> 01:38:16,291
- That's an evasion.
- She picked a perfect running mate:

1383
01:38:16,391 --> 01:38:18,501
King Westley,
the pill of the century.

1384
01:38:18,601 --> 01:38:22,922
She needs a guy that'd sock her once
a day whether it's coming to her or not.

1385
01:38:23,022 --> 01:38:24,727
If you had half the brains
you're supposed to,

1386
01:38:24,828 --> 01:38:27,307
- you'd have done it yourself.
- Do you love her?

1387
01:38:27,408 --> 01:38:30,430
A normal human being couldn't
live with her without going nutty!

1388
01:38:30,530 --> 01:38:34,184
- She's my idea of nothing.
- I asked a simple question: Do you love her?

1389
01:38:34,284 --> 01:38:37,312
Yes! But don't hold that against me.
I'm a little screwy myself.

1390
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:44,159
Well, here's to the merry-go-round.

1391
01:38:49,632 --> 01:38:52,667
Perfect. Now you look natural.

1392
01:38:57,849 --> 01:39:00,752
- I hope you got your money.
- You bet I did.

1393
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:03,755
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. Same to you.

1394
01:39:03,855 --> 01:39:06,925
Stay around and watch the fun.
You'll enjoy it immensely.

1395
01:39:07,025 --> 01:39:09,392
I would, but I've got a weak stomach.

1396
01:39:15,742 --> 01:39:17,442
I just had a long talk with him.

1397
01:39:17,543 --> 01:39:20,039
- I'm not interested.
- Just a minute, Ellie.

1398
01:39:20,140 --> 01:39:22,923
I don't want to hear
another word about him.

1399
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:38,289
Come on, folks. King Westley
has arrived. Come on!

1400
01:40:32,318 --> 01:40:34,477
There they come, boys. Turn 'em over.

1401
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:05,717
You're a sucker to
go through with this.

1402
01:41:06,978 --> 01:41:11,132
That guy Warne is okay.
He didn't want the reward.

1403
01:41:11,232 --> 01:41:15,470
All he asked for was $39.60,
what he spent on you.

1404
01:41:15,570 --> 01:41:19,940
Said it was a matter of principle.
You took him for a ride.

1405
01:41:26,372 --> 01:41:30,200
He loves you, Ellie. He told me so.

1406
01:41:31,878 --> 01:41:35,156
You don't want to be married
to a mug like Westley.

1407
01:41:35,256 --> 01:41:37,958
I can buy him off for a pot of gold.

1408
01:41:41,721 --> 01:41:46,751
And you can make an old man happy
and you won't do so bad for yourself.

1409
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:50,428
If you change your mind,
your car's waiting at the back gate.

1410
01:42:01,783 --> 01:42:03,851
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered together here...

1411
01:42:03,951 --> 01:42:06,821
in the sight of God and in
the face of this company...

1412
01:42:06,921 --> 01:42:10,024
to join together this man
and woman in holy matrimony.

1413
01:42:10,124 --> 01:42:14,278
If any man can show just cause why they
may not lawfully be joined together...

1414
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:19,290
let him now speak or else
hereafter forever hold his peace.

1415
01:42:21,427 --> 01:42:24,288
King, wilt thou have this
woman to thy wedded wife...

1416
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:27,882
- so long as ye both shall live?
- I will.

1417
01:42:28,768 --> 01:42:32,672
Ellen, wilt thou have this man
to thy wedded husband...

1418
01:42:32,772 --> 01:42:34,973
so long as ye both shall live?

1419
01:42:38,436 --> 01:42:41,097
- Ellen!
- Ellen! Ellen!

1420
01:42:41,197 --> 01:42:42,807
Ellie!

1421
01:42:53,835 --> 01:42:56,619
Where has she gone?

1422
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:16,014
- What happened?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

1423
01:43:30,913 --> 01:43:33,232
Don't want to talk to...

1424
01:43:33,332 --> 01:43:36,319
Don't want to talk to anybody.
Don't want to see anybody.

1425
01:43:36,419 --> 01:43:38,488
But it's King Westley on the phone.

1426
01:43:41,924 --> 01:43:45,495
Hello, my would-be ex-son-in-law.

1427
01:43:45,595 --> 01:43:48,539
I've sent you a check
for a hundred thousand.

1428
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:51,209
That's the smartest thing
you ever did, Westley...

1429
01:43:51,309 --> 01:43:53,461
not to contest that annulment.

1430
01:43:53,561 --> 01:43:57,465
That's satisfactory, isn't it?
Well, it oughta be.

1431
01:43:57,565 --> 01:44:00,676
I'm not complaining.
Oh, no. Not complaining.

1432
01:44:00,776 --> 01:44:02,804
It was dirt cheap.

1433
01:44:02,904 --> 01:44:05,522
Don't fall out of any windows!

1434
01:44:06,657 --> 01:44:10,353
There's another wire from Peter.
They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.

1435
01:44:10,453 --> 01:44:14,398
"What's holding up
the annulment, you slowpoke?

1436
01:44:14,498 --> 01:44:17,617
The walls of Jericho are toppling."

1437
01:44:19,128 --> 01:44:24,249
Send him a telegram right away.
Just say, "Let 'em topple."

1438
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:28,955
- Funny couple, ain't they?
- Yeah.

1439
01:44:29,055 --> 01:44:31,415
If you ask me, I don't
believe they're married.

1440
01:44:31,515 --> 01:44:33,918
They're married, all right.
I just seen the license.

1441
01:44:34,018 --> 01:44:36,879
They made me get 'em a
rope and a blanket.

1442
01:44:36,979 --> 01:44:39,549
On a night like this!
What do you reckon that's for?

1443
01:44:39,649 --> 01:44:43,057
- Blamed if I know. I brung 'em a trumpet.
- A trumpet?

1444
01:44:43,158 --> 01:44:45,847
One of them toy things.
They sent me to the store.

1445
01:44:45,947 --> 01:44:48,499
What in the world do
they want a trumpet for?

1446
01:44:48,599 --> 01:44:50,393
Don't know.

1446
01:44:51,305 --> 01:45:51,647
