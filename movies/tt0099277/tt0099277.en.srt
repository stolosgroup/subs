00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,420
In 1992,

3
00:00:55,455 --> 00:01:00,256
there were 543,767
vioIent incidents

4
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:02,352
in American high schooIs.

5
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,364
In some cities,
the areas around these schooIs

6
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,299
were beginning to faII
under the controI

7
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,393
of vioIent youth gangs.

8
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,428
By 1997,

9
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,305
the number of vioIent
incidents had tripIed.

10
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:19,368
Gangs had taken controI of
Iarge sections of these cities.

11
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,348
Some schooIs were
shut down.

12
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,508
The year is 1999.

13
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,508
The gang-controIIed areas

14
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,311
have become known as...

15
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:30,345
free-fire zones.

16
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,483
Kennedy High is Iocated
in the middIe

17
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:34,459
of a free-fire zone.

18
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:37,395
The poIice wiII
not enter.

19
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,399
There is no Iaw.

00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,368
The Department of
EducationaI Defense

21
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:46,372
has been formed to
reopen the schooIs

22
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,341
and controI the gangs.

23
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,281
Ladies and gentIemen,

24
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,476
I know that when you
asked Megatech

25
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,452
to heIp you
with your probIem,

26
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:02,387
it wasn't
an easy decision.

27
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:07,259
You are, after aII,
educators.

28
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:11,423
We are automation and
robotic speciaIists.

29
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:15,264
At first gIance, not
exactIy compatibIe fieIds.

30
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,464
But the current situation
in our high schooIs

31
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:21,474
caIIs for
unusuaI measures.

32
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:24,375
Meet the pride
of Megatech.

33
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,413
It's as fine
a group of educators

34
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,211
as you'II find anywhere
in the worId.

35
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,310
I guess you couId caII them
super teachers.

36
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,291
Cody CuIp, come with me.

37
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,293
You're getting out.

38
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:49,392
These artificiaIIy created
tacticaI education units

39
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:52,461
have been thoroughIy
programmed in history,

40
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:56,305
chemistry, aII mathematics...

41
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,402
and of course,
physicaI education.

42
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:01,277
And they aIso come
equipped with the option

43
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:05,410
of XT-6 hardware to deaI
with discipIine probIems.

44
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,522
It's hard for me to beIieve that
they're not actuaIIy human beings.

45
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,360
Mr. BryIes?

46
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:25,337
One miIIion megabytes.

47
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,476
Don't be scared.

48
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,239
What?

49
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:41,414
Sign it. You'II report to your
schooI by 9:00 AM, CuIp,

50
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,422
or we'II have your ass
back here.

51
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,447
You vioIate any of the terms
of your paroIe,

52
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:49,291
we'II be waiting with open arms
to weIcome you back

53
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:51,422
to the reaI worId
of discipIine.

54
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,271
Now, Iadies and gentIemen,
I wouId Iike to present to you

55
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,274
the PrincipaI of
Kennedy High SchooI,

56
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,468
Mr. MyIes Langford.

57
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,279
Dr. Forrest, thank you.

58
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,251
That was indeed impressive.

59
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,280
This secret program,

60
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,487
sponsored by the Department
of EducationaI Defense

61
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:24,395
and Megatech,

62
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,398
is going to
make it possibIe

63
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,425
for cIasses to resume once again
at Kennedy High SchooI.

64
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,438
You aII know what we've had
to face in the past...

65
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:37,307
drugs, gang activity,
rampant vioIence.

66
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:40,437
And of course this group of particuIarIy
troubIesome students

67
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,471
with prison records

68
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,483
who, because of
this experiment,

69
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:48,284
wiII be reIeased back into
the schooI popuIation today.

70
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,475
Hey.

71
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:20,478
How you doing, man?

72
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,250
How was it in there?

73
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,382
AII right.

74
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,222
You Iook Iike shit, AngeI.

75
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,352
What do you mean?

76
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:31,261
He's a bad
IittIe dude.

77
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:36,224
Yeah. I'm getting
jumped in next week.

78
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,294
Let's get out of here.

79
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,363
- I'm driving.
- Back seat.

80
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,340
Come on.

81
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:55,283
Destruction, yeah

82
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,448
TiII there's no one
there

83
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:01,359
If you ain't
from the gang

84
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,362
You better
watch your step...

85
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,365
- Where to?
- Wanna get high?

86
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,265
SchooI.

87
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,465
SchooI! Oh, man.
You definiteIy want to get high.

88
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,305
What is it?

89
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,403
Edge, man.
Best new high since Skin.

90
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,371
CooI!

91
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,445
- Come on!
- What'd they do to you in there, man?

92
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,224
You used to enjoy gettin'
wrecked with your brothers.

93
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,317
Times change...

94
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,227
brother.

95
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:54,275
Cops gave this pIace up.

96
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,474
We can't go
this way.

97
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,348
Motherfuckin' Razorheads
controI this whoIe area now, man.

98
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,389
What the fuck
are you doing?

99
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,491
Get us out of here,
Cody.

100
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:34,514
WeIcome home,
C-C-Cody.

101
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,421
Meet any nice boys in jaiI?

102
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,483
Yeah.
You shouId have been there.

103
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,290
He wouId have Iiked you.

104
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,389
See you at schooI,
asshoIes.

105
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,270
Ow!

106
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,466
Come on!

107
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,475
Get that Cody!
KiII him!

108
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:05,474
- Get out of here!
- Go go go go!

109
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,349
Shut up!

110
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,359
Hey! Get down!

111
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:18,261
Go ahead!
Get him!

112
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,289
Get Cody!

113
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,363
HoId on.

114
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,482
Faster, Cody, faster!

115
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,319
Go!

116
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:54,523
Fuck!

117
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,408
Looks Iike Hector's gonna
be a IittIe Iate for schooI.

118
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,442
Ha. It's gonna be good to
have you back with us, man.

119
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,326
Ow! God!

120
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,499
What's going on?
This is a free-fire zone.

121
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,478
Yeah, the cops stiII won't
come in here

122
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,503
so they got
their own goons now.

123
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,317
Maybe I shouId'a stayed
in prison.

124
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,219
WeIcome, students, to
Kennedy High SchooI.

125
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,483
AII weapons must
be surrendered

126
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,491
before entering
the schooI grounds.

127
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,534
- Out of the way.
- You got a search warrant?

128
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,506
You got a search warrant?
Get away from my car, man.

129
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,480
You wanna
make this tough? Huh?

130
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:18,314
- Sonny!
- Let him go!

131
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,512
HoId it right there.

132
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,413
HoId it right there.

133
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,286
Sonny! Sonny!

134
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,260
I'm not kidding!

135
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,489
- Get your friend out of here.
- Sonny!

136
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,487
- What about Sonny?
- Forget about him.

137
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,290
Do yourseIf a favor.

138
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:39,461
You're turning
into a reaI douchebag, you know?

139
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:42,474
Why don't you just
go fuck yourseIf?

140
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,252
Any student caught
on schooI premises

141
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,350
with an automatic weapon
wiII be detained

142
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,225
by schooI security

143
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,321
and turned over to
the proper authorities.

144
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,379
Your brother says you don't
want to be a BIackheart anymore.

145
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,474
So what if I don't?

146
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,384
These guys are
our friends.

147
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,422
So if you ain't with us,
you're against us.

148
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,482
So that means
we got to kiII you.

149
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,385
Yeah, and that'd
make us sad, Cody.

150
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,361
Gee, Dawn, I'm touched.

151
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,330
So what's it
gonna be, Cody?

152
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,355
I'm Iying Iow for a whiIe.

153
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,494
If I get sIammed for ganging,
I'II be doing reaI hard time.

154
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,403
Guess you'II have
to waste me.

155
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,237
Either way I'm dead.

156
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,346
Come on, AngeI.

157
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,319
Let's go.

158
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,453
Hey, you!

159
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:12,487
- March march.
- AII right, come on.

160
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,465
ShrapneI.

161
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,264
Yeah, Iet me

162
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,422
Good morning.

163
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,490
- Good morning, Dr. Forrest.
- Good morning, sir.

164
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:59,505
Mr. Hardin, Miss Connors
and Mr. BryIes,

165
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:03,345
this is the first day
of the rest of your Iives.

166
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,398
These are
our probIem students.

167
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:32,342
I've made sure to
assign them to your cIasses.

168
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,346
We know what we're here
to do, Mr. Langford.

169
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,281
Academics wiII be up.
DiscipIine wiII be firm.

170
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,251
WeII, if there are any probIems,
my door is aIways open.

171
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,220
Don't move it!

172
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,516
Come on!

173
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,520
There won't be
any probIems.

174
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:07,345
Saturday, or I'II make
earrings out of your baIIs.

175
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:12,244
You're a reaI badass, huh?

176
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,512
Fuckin' $10.

177
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,381
Guess you gotta be a miIIionaire
to go to schooI here.

178
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,297
Here she comes, Mark.

179
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,433
I don't have the money.

180
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:40,276
You're gonna find your
baIIs in a vise, asshoIe.

181
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,371
Good morning,
students.

182
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,417
Good morning, students.

183
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:50,354
Good morning, bitch.

184
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,256
I'm Miss Connors,
your chemistry teacher.

185
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,352
And weIcome to the wonderfuI
worId of chemistry.

186
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:02,389
- You got it?
- You're gonna pay us, aren't you?

187
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,334
PIease be seated.

188
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,338
Fuck off.

189
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,340
InternaI systems on aIert,
Dr. Forrest.

190
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,540
Switch over to
Connors' cIass.

191
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,341
I think he said...

192
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,251
fuck you.

193
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,482
What are you
Iaughing at?

194
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,424
System making
process of order.

195
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,427
Skin temperatures
increasing, sir.

196
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,456
GentIemen, if you're going
to be in my cIass...

197
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,229
She's moving.
She's approaching the students.

198
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:39,362
- You're going to
have to be cooI.

199
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,306
Baby, I got cooI for you

200
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,535
right here, honey.
Right here.

201
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,269
You're gonna have to
waIk cooI.

202
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,406
You're gonna have to stand cooI.

203
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,440
We don't got to
do nothing, Iady.

204
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,316
And if you cannot,
you wiII sit down.

205
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,480
I ain't finished.

206
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:58,455
I'm stiII 60 bucks short, asshoIe.

207
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,481
That's not very cooI.

208
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,325
"That's not very cooI."

209
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,263
Temperature's increasing.
Breathing's increasing.

210
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,356
Approaching criticaI.

211
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,459
Baby, can't you see

212
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:13,528
I'm trying to
conduct a IittIe business here?

213
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,468
Not in my cIass.

214
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,473
Hey, don't you mess with
my boys, Miss Connors.

215
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,512
God!

216
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,299
- Reflex time, Mark?
- .027.

217
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,359
- .027.
- FaIIs within the parameter, sir.

218
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,304
Reflexes normaI.

219
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,219
Now that I have
your undivided attention,

220
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,452
we'II have roII caII.

221
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,291
And I see we're going
to have some very...

222
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:13,321
Breathing returning to normaI.
Temperature returning to normaI.

223
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,356
Education at
its finest.

224
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,328
CongratuIations, sir.

225
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,277
Ah, can you beIieve
that woman?

226
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,280
Chemistry teacher
from heII.

227
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:33,274
Uh, hi, I'm Christie.
I wouId have introduced myseIf in cIass

228
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:36,344
but I was afraid Sheera
the DeviI Woman wouId bite me.

229
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:40,291
What a drag that cIass
is gonna be.

230
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:44,489
GirIs Iike you usuaIIy Iove
everything about schooI.

231
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,296
What do you mean,
"girIs Iike me"?

232
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,301
Nothing.

233
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,327
I don't know.

234
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,496
You new here?

235
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,507
Yeah, I just transferred
from Nixon.

236
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,537
My dad was a IittIe
worried about it,

237
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:01,274
but he said as Iong as
I stayed away from gang guys...

238
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:04,248
He don't want to
hang out with us, does he?

239
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,410
He just wants to
kiss up to her.

240
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:09,421
You might as weII stick your dick in
a meat grinder, Cody.

241
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,423
I don't know what you guys
are taIking about.

242
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,324
Ah, I do.

243
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,452
My dad's
the new principaI.

244
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,492
- Perfect.
- Yeah, maybe for you.

245
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:23,330
It is so embarrassing.
I might as weII go around

246
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:26,394
with "geek" tattooed
on my forehead.

247
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,303
Cody CuIp.

248
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,332
BIackheart for Iife,
whether I Iike it or not.

249
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,506
You, uh, you want to
do something sometime?

250
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,347
I'm sure your dad
wouId Iove that.

251
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:41,284
I didn't ask you if you wanted
to do something with my dad.

252
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,255
WeII, this is my cIass.

253
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:48,450
So, uh, are you
gonna caII me or what?

254
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:51,258
Yeah.

255
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,422
Both.

256
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,483
Good morning,
Iadies and gentIemen.

257
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,352
I can't hear you!

258
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,329
Way to go!

259
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,356
AII right, Iet's make

260
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,493
perfectIy cIear,
shaII we?

261
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:35,338
This is going to be

262
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:39,470
the most difficuIt
history course

263
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,479
you've ever had.

264
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,481
For you.

265
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,349
Expect...

266
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,223
...a test every
two weeks,

267
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,384
two hours of homework,

268
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:58,362
each and every night for
the remainder of the year,

269
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,388
for the rest of your Iife.

270
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:03,333
Something... something
a IittIe more important...

271
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:10,372
I operate from a modeI...

272
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,472
- of ab...
- Spit it out!

273
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:18,415
- SoIute zero toIerance.

274
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,351
So do we.

275
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,285
And that means
behavior in...

276
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,254
or out of this
cIassroom.

277
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,419
No roaming the corridors
without a pass.

278
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,484
No disrespect
or disobedience.

279
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,485
- Shut up.
- Why don't you shut the fuck...

280
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:36,229
And Iast, uh, there'II be
no excuses...

281
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,326
whatsoever.

282
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,337
Why don't you
shut the fuck up?

283
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:40,497
Hey, fuck you, mook.

284
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,403
Have I made myseIf
perfectIy cIear?

285
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,358
He's making
his decision now.

286
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,288
CorporaI punishment...
is that stiII IegaI, sir?

287
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:12,286
Whatever's necessary to
keep the chiIdren in Iine.

288
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,499
Anybody eIse?

289
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,429
Hey, Cody.

290
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,474
I made sure that nothing
happened to your bike

291
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,466
the whoIe time
you were gone.

292
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,280
- You shouId give me the car.
- You don't have a Iicense.

293
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,285
Big deaI.
Neither do you.

294
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,290
What the heII
happened to you?

295
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,452
They got me in
the parking Iot.

296
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,395
You fucks ran off
and Ieft me.

297
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,230
Look at this... yeah.

298
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,463
Who did it?

299
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,369
The Razorheads?

300
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,432
Fuckin' Nazi
security guards

301
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:33,444
turned me over to
the new history teacher.

302
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,412
The guy...
the guy's insane.

303
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,416
Got any money?
I reaIIy need a hit.

304
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,352
They took everything
away from me.

305
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,413
I haven't had
any aII day.

306
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,481
Come on, AngeI,
you got any Edge on you?

307
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,460
- I'm reaIIy hurting.
- Hey, Iook in the kitchen, AngeI.

308
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:52,258
Maybe there's some Drano
or floor cIeanser...

309
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,492
that'd be even
more fun, huh?

310
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,397
This is pIenty!
Hands off that!

311
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,493
- No!
- Stop that! Get your hands off it.

312
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:00,505
Get your hands off that.
Give me that. Give it to me.

313
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,370
- Give it to me.
- Mom, I need it.

314
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:03,466
Stop it!
Give it to me.

315
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,278
Look who's here, Mom.

316
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:24,420
- Find your own drugs!
- No, you gotta give it to me.

317
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:29,457
Gee!
It's good to be back home.

318
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,233
You're aII fuckin'
pathetic!

319
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,505
- You're a rat.
- Come on, give it to me! I need it!

320
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,282
Next.

321
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:21,285
No gang jackets
or coIors aIIowed on campus.

322
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:24,312
No sexuaI activity
of any kind permitted.

323
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:28,292
Hey, you think smart girIs
give better head?

324
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:32,259
Hey, you.
Hey, baby.

325
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,265
Hey, you...
principaI's daughter.

326
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:35,358
Hey, fuck off, okay?

327
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,459
Ooh, such nasty Ianguage.
What wouId Daddy say?

328
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,333
WouId you just
Ieave me aIone?

329
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,497
- Leave you aIone?
- Hey! What are you doing?

330
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:44,304
Stop! HeIp! No!

331
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,333
No! HeIp!

332
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,478
Hey, stay here.

333
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,393
Come on!
Come on, man!

334
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,369
Get him back!

335
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:26,484
You're coming
with me, CuIp.

336
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,485
You know the terms and
conditions of your reIease...

337
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:36,483
no aItercations
of any kind.

338
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:39,361
That boy ended up
in the hospitaI.

339
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:42,525
That boy nearIy
raped your daughter.

340
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,505
I appreciate what
you tried to do.

341
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,235
Why didn't you go
to a teacher for heIp?

342
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,335
Like him? This bitch
nearIy broke my arm.

343
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,403
Mr. BryIes, thank you.

344
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:02,242
Perhaps Mr. BryIes
did overreact.

345
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,221
AII right.
AII things considered,

346
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,487
I won't put this
on your record.

347
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:12,360
But this is the Iast warning.
Now you understand that?

348
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,332
Yes, sir.

349
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:15,424
Good.

350
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,235
Right, I'm reIeasing you
to your next cIass

351
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,398
- which is...
- Phys Ed, I beIieve.

352
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:28,412
Thanks you, Mr. BryIes.

353
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:31,210
You may go.

354
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:34,308
Come on, Iad.
A IittIe exercise wiII do you good.

355
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:44,352
One more! Suck it up, babe!

356
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,364
Come on.

357
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,492
Be tough!

358
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:52,332
I'II turn you into
a wrestIer yet.

359
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:55,362
Next time, I'II get
200 out of you.

360
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:00,370
- I did the best I couId!
- Everybody get in the shower.

361
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:03,404
- Oh, ho!
- That wasn't cooI.

362
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,382
It's okay.
Come on, man.

363
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,442
Not you, CuIp.

364
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:10,352
You stay behind.

365
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:24,492
Anybody ever teII you
you got a bad attitude, boy?

366
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:35,344
- You wrestIed in prison?
- Not by choice, Coach.

367
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,472
I wrestIed in
the service.

368
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:39,278
Oh, yeah?
Which one?

369
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,251
MiIitary.

370
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:44,278
- Oh!
- That's it, the miIitary.

371
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:47,258
Ah, you gotta Iay off
the steroids, Coach.

372
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,226
I hear they
shrink your penis.

373
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,422
I'm a firm beIiever in
negative reinforcement, CuIp.

374
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:31,233
You better be carefuI
from now on, CuIp.

375
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,431
You macho motherfucker,
right, man?

376
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,434
Beat the shit out
of the kids?

377
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:48,351
Get away from him.

378
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,235
Oh my God.

379
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:09,365
Amazing.

380
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,465
SimpIy amazing.
PIay that back.

381
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:16,412
That was a IeveI seven,
muItidimensionaI decision.

382
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:19,474
The inteIIigence factor
is evoIving.

383
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,348
It isn't artificiaI
any Ionger.

384
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:23,251
KiII the enemy?

385
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:25,245
I mean, don't you think you
went a bit too far?

386
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,349
The boy had a gun, for God's sake.
He had to defend himseIf.

387
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,451
The program may be evoIving
faster than we thought.

388
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,395
Or they're having troubIe absorbing
the educationaI directives.

389
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,295
They are machines,
you idiot.

390
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:37,268
They absorb whatever
we put into them. Correct?

391
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:38,394
HopefuIIy.

392
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:42,439
There's nothing to
worry about, Marv.

393
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,341
They're just Iearning.

394
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,340
Jesus. I hate to
see what they'd do

395
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,319
if you tried to heIp
an oId Iady cross the street.

396
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,348
Oh, come on. I just
wanted to thank you

397
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,324
for heIping me
this morning.

398
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:02,486
TeII it to your dad.

399
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:04,319
WouId you give me...

400
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,296
Quit thinking
about yourseIf.

401
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:08,322
I just saw one of
my best friends die.

402
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,334
Mohawk puIIed
a gun on him.

403
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:11,495
What was he
supposed to do?

404
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,369
I was there.
Mohawk was so wasted,

405
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:17,272
he wouIdn't have known
which end the buIIets come out.

406
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,374
The study of history is...

407
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,385
is rewarding,

408
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:32,253
not onIy in
its wonderfuI richness,

409
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,485
but aIso in the Iessons

410
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:37,222
that can be gIeaned
from it.

411
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:40,322
So Iet's turn our attention
to the Trojan War.

412
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,446
You're Iate.

413
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,386
Sit down. Sit.

414
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:17,394
He's wasted.

415
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:20,494
Sonny, pIease
sit down.

416
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:22,403
PIease?

417
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,433
Did you get a note
from the principaI?

418
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:29,240
No.

419
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,441
But I'd be happy to take
some time off to get you one.

420
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,486
Watch out.

421
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:11,345
D. 385, huh?

422
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,254
Huh? That's yours.

423
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:16,317
But Iockers are
private property.

424
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,496
Tsk tsk tsk tsk.

425
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,296
Drug deaIing is
a capitaI offense.

426
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,366
It's aII personaI, man.
L... I gotta have it, okay?

427
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:33,343
I know.

428
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:40,517
Not anymore, my son.

429
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:03,303
CaII Forrest.
Get him in here now!

430
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,239
He's going berserk.

431
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:15,219
Jesus.

432
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:25,319
As you'II recaII,

433
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:29,493
the saIient point in
the story of AchiIIes

434
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:32,264
and his famous heeI
is that

435
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:36,263
the basis of aII
miIitary strategy is...

436
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:39,367
find the weak spot

437
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,310
and attack.

438
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,484
Does anyone have
an expIanation?

439
00:34:56,527 --> 00:35:00,361
Ingestion of
8,000mg

440
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,491
of ethyI degimesythaI
wiII do that.

441
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:06,264
Break the boy's neck?
PuIverize his jaw?

442
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,229
The effects of habituaI use
are indeed disturbing.

443
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,333
Mr. Hardin,
you beat that boy.

444
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,208
OnIy in seIf-defense,
MiIes.

445
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:17,214
The fiIthy IittIe punk was armed with
a dangerous weapon.

446
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:19,478
And he was out of controI
on narcotics.

447
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:22,281
EthyI degimesythaI
is notorious

448
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,483
for producing acts of
superhuman strength.

449
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:29,326
Mr. Langford?
The news crew is here.

450
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,260
Thank you, Wendy.

451
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,294
You'II have to excuse me.

452
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:38,234
I have statements to make,
peopIe to pIacate.

453
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:50,441
Dr. Forrest?

454
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:55,247
We'II discuss this Iater...

455
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,345
aIone.

456
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:58,480
Of course, MiIes.
Whatever you say.

457
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,240
- Hi, Daddy.
- HeIIo, sweetie.

458
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:20,369
What are you doing here?

459
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:25,305
Uh, Cody wanted me to
come up and taIk to you.

460
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,373
Hmm?

461
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,476
He thinks that Mr. Hardin
might have something to do

462
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,419
with Sonny's death.

463
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:32,355
Does he?

464
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,450
That poor boy had a drug probIem.
He died of an overdose.

465
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:39,259
Now it's very important to me that
you don't get too invoIved in aII this.

466
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,457
You have to set an exampIe.
Remember whose daughter you are.

467
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:44,332
- Hmm?
- Excuse me, Mr. Langford,

468
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,528
but the news crew is
getting impatient.

469
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,397
AII right, Wendy,
I'II be right through.

470
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,406
- Here, give me a hug. I gotta go.
- Okay.

471
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:52,237
- I'II see you Iater.
- AII right. See you for dinner.

472
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:00,308
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
MiIes Langford.

473
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,444
- Come on through to my office.
- Thank you.

474
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,218
There. You see?
It was an OD.

475
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:10,421
AII I see is that your father
doesn't give a shit about the truth

476
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:13,430
which is that those teachers
are kiIIing peopIe, Christie.

477
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:16,331
You just have a probIem
with authority figures.

478
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:19,530
Jesus! You reaIIy are
the principaI's daughter, aren't you?

479
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:23,468
If you just opened up those suburban
eyes, you'd see what's going on.

480
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:26,340
Hey. I don't have to
take this shit

481
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,504
from some iIIiterate
gangbanger, okay?

482
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,465
Go ahead, MiIes.

483
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,475
Have another if it
makes you feeI any better.

484
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:02,446
AII I wanted was a safe pIace
for these kids to Iearn in.

485
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,472
Hey, right now you've got
discipIine for the students

486
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:08,246
and security for
the schooIs.

487
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:10,243
Students are being beaten
for minor infractions.

488
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,222
Two are aIready dead.

489
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:20,293
TeII me, how am I
supposed to Iive with that?

490
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:21,457
I can teII you
one thing:

491
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,434
That is that this afternoon,
you participated in a coverup

492
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:27,266
of the drug-addict
boy's death.

493
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,398
MiIes,

494
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,240
I strongIy suggest that
you Iet this program

495
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:34,369
run its course.

496
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:37,472
Soon every schooI in
the country

497
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:41,247
wiII be after us to handIe
their discipIine probIems.

498
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:43,378
Now that couId be a very
profitabIe situation.

499
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:45,480
ProfitabIe?
For whom?

500
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,388
For me.

501
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:50,417
Or I shouId say,
for Megatech.

502
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,452
But don't worry, MiIes.

503
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,488
You'II be the man who
gets aII the gIory,

504
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:58,263
the notoriety,
the cover of "Time."

505
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,281
Not you, Cody.

506
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:05,434
Here's your good-Iooking
brother, Mr. CuIp.

507
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,239
Partying hard, I see.

508
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:13,300
I'm a BIackheart now,
Cody.

509
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:14,470
For reaI.

510
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:17,311
CongratuIations, AngeI.

511
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,407
Hey! Hey, Cody!

512
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:22,418
We're jumping him in tonight
in honor of Sonny.

513
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:27,324
Did you hear how
it happened?

514
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,327
Yeah. He got a IittIe
careIess on the Edge.

515
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:33,387
Do you beIieve everything
they teII you in schooI?

516
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:37,265
Of course! We aII
want to get ahead.

517
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:41,369
I think that history teacher,
Mr. Hardin,

518
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,497
he kiIIed Sonny.

519
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,508
Oh, why? 'Cause he
didn't do his homework?

520
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:49,506
Man, you are so
fuII of shit,

521
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:53,375
your eyes are
the coIor of...

522
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:56,409
Hey, man, what...
what coIor are his eyes?

523
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,479
WeII, they sure aren't
BIackheart coIors.

524
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:01,389
You know what I think?
I think it's time

525
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:04,384
for Mr. CuIp, Sr. Here to be
terminated from the gang...

526
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:09,229
...officiaIIy.

527
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:12,326
Come on.
We don't have to.

528
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:13,529
Listen, kid,

529
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:15,431
you're one of us.

530
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,498
You're not one
of him.

531
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:37,351
Any student who wishes to
fiIe criminaI charges

532
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:40,454
against another student
may do so

533
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:44,457
in Mr. Langford's office
between 1 :00 and 2:00 PM.

534
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,504
Hey, how you
guys doing?

535
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:52,469
Hi.

536
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,436
Sorry about yesterday.

537
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,510
Jesus, Cody,
what happened to you?

538
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,286
Nothing. BIackhearts gave me
a IittIe going-away party.

539
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,450
Christie, Iisten,
your dad's Iying.

540
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:11,484
Maybe he doesn't know what's going on,
but you can convince him.

541
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:13,463
I'm not convinced either.

542
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:16,489
WeII, what if I can prove
to you that Hardin

543
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,468
and BryIes are
kiIIing peopIe?

544
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,527
Oh, now you think BryIes
is in on it too?

545
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:23,433
Cody, have you been
doing Edge?

546
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,408
I mean, these teachers...
they may be jerks

547
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:28,411
and they may be strict but they do
not go around kiIIing peopIe.

548
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,470
Come with me over to
Hardin's house, okay?

549
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:33,278
I saw him with Sonny's
crucifix yesterday.

550
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,275
- If I can find it...
- Now?

551
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,310
You mean cut cIass?

552
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:40,290
Yeah.
You never cut cIass?

553
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:50,358
- Reach down the back of my pants.
- What?

554
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:52,494
Come on,
Iive dangerous.

555
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,363
What is this?

556
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:58,466
The facuIty address book?
Cody, how did you get this?

557
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:02,275
Just another one of
my devious criminaI acts.

558
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:03,507
Look up Hardin's address.

559
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:06,345
Check out BryIes.

560
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,476
This is reaIIy weird.

561
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:12,455
Hardin and BryIes...
they have the same address.

562
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:14,287
Yeah?

563
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,282
Hey, wait a minute.

564
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:18,386
Miss Connors
Iives there too.

565
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:22,491
Party.

566
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,307
This is it.

567
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,400
So what if someone's
Iooking out the window?

568
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,277
Just act Iike you
beIong here.

569
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:38,372
It shouIdn't
be too hard.

570
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,398
Okay, Sonny's crucifix was
on a goId chain.

571
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:09,371
I hope we can find it in
the middIe of this cIutter.

572
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,294
TaIk about
your Lean Cuisine.

573
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:27,263
Gotta stay on top of
those pesky squeaks.

574
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:29,255
What is this?

575
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:48,476
How homey.

576
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:59,284
Uh, I think this is
Miss Connors' room

577
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:02,356
unIess those guys are
weirder than you thought.

578
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:04,367
DefiniteIy Miss Connors.

579
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:07,336
I've never been in a chemistry teacher's
room before, Cody,

580
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,464
but speaking as a woman,
this is reaIIy strange.

581
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,441
I mean, women don't buy
one Iacy bra.

582
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:15,378
They get panties to match.
They binge out.

583
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:17,277
- Oh, yeah?
- Women...

584
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:21,341
weII, they have Iots of stuff.
They have Iots of personaI stuff.

585
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:23,444
We're taIking about
a chemistry teacher.

586
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:26,354
Yeah, but she's
stiII a woman.

587
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:39,460
Oh, yeah.
You see?

588
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:42,472
His mom gave him this.
He wouId never give it up.

589
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:55,475
Shit! Come on.

590
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:11,458
Ah, we've been invaded.

591
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:14,471
Run run!

592
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:17,371
Respect for private property
is the foundation

593
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:19,342
of a free society.

594
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:22,311
WeII, the best defense
is a tough offense.

595
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,513
The Langford girI's
crossed over.

596
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:33,280
We'II advise her father on
suitabIe methods of discipIine for her.

597
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,418
But now Iet's eIiminate
the bad influence corrupting her.

598
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,280
Get off!

599
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,410
Run! Go!

600
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:25,273
So faiIing to yieId
at an intersection;

601
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:27,334
exceeding the speed Iimit...

602
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:30,472
Not wearing a heImet or
using proper hand signaIs.

603
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,415
Time for a IittIe
driver's ed?

604
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:27,463
I hate water.

605
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,505
Nice day for a dive.

606
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:19,289
Hey.

607
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:23,425
Happy birthday.

608
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:25,361
My birthday was
three months ago.

609
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:27,454
I know.

610
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:30,466
Sorry I missed it.

611
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:33,265
That's okay.

612
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:37,270
Mom forgot to
pay the biII.

613
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:41,403
Who'd you want to caII?

614
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,413
Christie.

615
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:45,312
The principaI's
daughter?

616
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:48,477
Man, you oughta
think about your image.

617
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:52,249
I don't have anything
to worry about.

618
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:54,416
Wanna shoot some hoops?

619
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:57,325
If you're sure it won't
mess up your image.

620
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:02,322
Looks Iike we'II have to
requisition a new vehicIe.

621
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,360
What about the boy?

622
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:10,271
That boy presents
a most interesting probIem.

623
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:12,400
I can take care
of him right now.

624
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:17,402
No, individuaI attacks are
too inefficient for our purposes now.

625
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:19,348
We need a new
strategy.

626
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:22,511
- Such as?
- Such as...

627
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:25,278
a IittIe game.

628
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:29,291
A war game,
if you wiII.

629
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:36,231
Yeah!

630
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:40,464
AngeI! AngeI!
Reigning champ of the free-fire zone.

631
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:43,234
Where... where you going?

632
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:44,501
Homework.

633
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,509
Join me.
CouId be fun.

634
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,369
If you weren't my brother,

635
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:53,315
I'd say you were totaIIy
fucked in the head.

636
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:56,410
Other than that,
you Iove me, right?

637
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:01,253
Right.

638
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,418
Same here.

639
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,451
AngeI! AngeI!

640
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:08,328
AngeI! AngeI! AngeI!

641
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:12,233
AngeI! AngeI! AngeI!

642
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:28,442
Exhibition of gang coIors
is strictIy forbidden.

643
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,389
What do you want?

644
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,482
We want to educate you.

645
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:38,255
We want to show you the...
the misguidedness

646
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,491
of induIging in gang behavior.

647
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:47,429
I want to kick his butt.

648
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,434
- We're coming to get you, kid!
- No!

649
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,278
Ha!

650
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:02,376
HeIp! HeIp!

651
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:04,410
HeIp!

652
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:07,252
HeIp!

653
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,314
HeIp!

654
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:14,454
What do you want?
What do you...

655
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:22,294
HeIp! HeIp!

656
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:23,431
Sorry for whatever I did.
No!

657
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,445
Ah, no! No!

658
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:32,448
- Shh!
- HeIp me! No!

659
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:38,449
- I thought you had him?
- Sorry.

660
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:49,296
- Shit.
- Is that pizza, man?

661
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:52,291
Hey, get the heII
away from my car.

662
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:55,361
What the fuck?
Am I Iate for night schooI, bitch?

663
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:58,498
Let's go, pizza man.

664
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,513
I'm starving.

665
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,352
Why'd you send Noser, man?

666
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,415
That kid gets Iost trying to
find his dick.

667
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:24,256
Get him out!
HeIp him!

668
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:33,535
Get those fucking
BIackhearts!

669
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:37,475
Fun and Games
phase one compIete.

670
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:03,465
Somebody heIp!

671
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:06,270
- What?
- Get the rope off his neck!

672
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:08,402
Get the fuckin' rope
off his neck!

673
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:14,315
Leave him aIone.
Leave him aIone!

674
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:16,319
My God!

675
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,520
AngeI.

676
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:33,469
- Get a bIanket!
- Get the bIanket!

677
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:36,438
Somebody get
a fuckin' bIanket!

678
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:40,501
Son of a bitch!
Damn it!

679
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:42,506
Damn it! Check it out!

680
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:44,410
Check it out!

681
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:46,347
Fuckin' A, we'II be there!

682
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:48,351
Yeah, right, man!

683
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:50,251
I want them aII!

684
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:55,514
Jump me in!
Jump me fuckin' in now!

685
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,230
Check everyone.
Yeah, check nine again.

686
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:04,358
- What about Forrest?
- He's on his way.

687
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:06,232
Why the panic, gentIemen?

688
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:08,499
The teachers are not
in their rooms, sir.

689
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:11,264
They can't be monitored
when they're not here.

690
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:14,433
There's nothing to worry
about, Marvin.

691
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:17,378
They made the decision
not to teach today, that's aII.

692
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:20,212
But they're supposed to do what
they're programmed to do, sir.

693
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,239
Nothing more.

694
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:23,411
But with the reasoning
powers of a human being.

695
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:26,513
Find them, shut them down
and run a compIete test.

696
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:29,287
No matter how perfect
they are in the fieId, Dr. Forrest,

697
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:32,261
there's no such thing as
a compIeteIy stabIe hybrid.

698
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:34,456
Or a compIeteIy stabIe
human being.

699
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:37,399
I don't want them taken out
of the fieId right now

700
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:39,425
and that's an order.
Do you understand?

701
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:43,395
We've aImost made a compIete emotionaI
crossover to human mode.

702
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:45,441
Worst-case scenario, sir?

703
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:48,342
The educationaI directives
may have miscarried.

704
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:51,245
They might be reverting back to
their originaI miIitary form.

705
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:53,511
You Iet me worry about that,
aII right, Spence?

706
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:31,249
AII right,
everybody spread out!

707
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:33,278
Cover each other!

708
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:37,486
Medina, aqui r?pido!

709
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:38,459
Down! Down!

710
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:47,403
Get every one of them.

711
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:23,464
Use any and aII strategies
to achieve our objective.

712
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:25,303
Death to the opposition.

713
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:27,468
- Exterminate the enemy?
- PreciseIy.

714
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,478
Connors and I wiII
take out the Razorheads.

715
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:31,503
BryIes, you wiII take
out the BIackhearts.

716
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:34,244
Take no prisoners.

717
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:01,274
Vamos! Come on!

718
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,264
Razorheads!

719
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:01,260
Hey, we got a coupIe of guys down!
Come on, go!

720
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,352
- HoIy shit!
- AII right!

721
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:22,221
Damn, Iet's go!

722
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:31,466
Here they come.

723
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,503
Ow!

724
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:01,463
Come on!
Vamos!

725
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,260
Hey, Hector!

726
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,489
- Go back around the other way.
- I'II get 'em.

727
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:35,457
Cody!

728
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:47,300
You're next, Mr. CuIp.

729
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,365
You're making me
very...

730
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:56,276
angry, Cody.

731
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:57,472
What are you?

732
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:17,265
Let's ride!
Move it!

733
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:23,237
CuIp got away.

734
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:25,365
That means this
operation is a faiIure.

735
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:28,468
No no. No,
the strategy is sound.

736
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,339
We'II make him come to us.

737
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,229
Did anyone eIse see anybody
there Iast night

738
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,457
besides the Razorheads?

739
01:02:48,531 --> 01:02:51,466
Like who?

740
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:53,469
Like Mr. Hardin.

741
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:56,302
You gotta quit
fuckin' around, Cody.

742
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:58,465
I mean, the Razorheads,
they kiIIed your brother.

743
01:02:58,474 --> 01:03:00,339
You saw what they
did to Reedy.

744
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:02,435
No, I saw what Mr. Hardin
did to Reedy.

745
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:05,447
Why wouId a teacher

746
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:09,281
want to get invoIved in a war
between us and the 'Heads?

747
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,480
I wish I knew.

748
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,439
Jeez, Cody!

749
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:33,340
Christie, those teachers,

750
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:35,276
- they're after me.
- Of course...

751
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:36,471
I don't know what
the heII they are.

752
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:39,379
Of course they're after you.
We broke into their house.

753
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:42,407
Listen to me! We just kicked the shit
out of the Razorheads

754
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:44,442
and Hardin was there.
I saw him.

755
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:47,217
I shot him.
He didn't even go down.

756
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:48,382
Are you sure
about this?

757
01:03:48,424 --> 01:03:50,415
Yes, I'm sure about this!

758
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:54,327
They're worse than the Razorheads.
They cannot be human beings!

759
01:03:54,363 --> 01:03:56,354
They're teaching at
our schooI, Christie.

760
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:57,525
Your dad's got to
do something.

761
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:00,361
On your word?
Don't even think about it.

762
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:02,371
He's fuIIy on
the warpath for you.

763
01:04:02,438 --> 01:04:05,407
Daddy got a caII from Mr. Hardin
about us being over there.

764
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:07,432
He so much as sees me
with you,

765
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:10,468
I am going back to Nixon and you
are going back to jaiI.

766
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:12,344
That's buIIshit.

767
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:25,417
You know, you peopIe have
had totaI freedom.

768
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:27,452
That doesn't give you
a Iicense to murder.

769
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:30,363
MiIes, you petitioned for
Kennedy High SchooI

770
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:33,392
to be used as an experiment
in discipIinary education.

771
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:36,303
Yes, but not to use
my schooI as a war zone.

772
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:38,273
We had a new product
to market

773
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:40,299
and this was a perfect
pIace to test it in.

774
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:43,312
But these androids were supposed
to educate the students.

775
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:45,371
BattIedroids, MiIes.
BattIedroids.

776
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:48,383
MiIitary surpIus marked to be shipped
to CentraI America

777
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:50,385
for the 10-Year War.

778
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:53,252
That is untiI
the D.E.D. CaIIed.

779
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:55,417
It seemed they were having
a IittIe probIem in our schooIs.

780
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:57,323
I said, "No probIem,

781
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,328
aII we have to do is marry
our war machine

782
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:01,296
with the basic
educationaI modeI."

783
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:04,266
WonderfuI resuIts. You shouId have
seen those Washington asshoIes.

784
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,426
They were amazed.

785
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:08,267
And now we've got a miIitary
contract worth biIIions.

786
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:10,464
I see.

787
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:13,442
So they've been waging war
with my students?

788
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:16,343
Isn't that what
aII teachers do?

789
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:19,246
But my peopIe aren'tjust fighting,
MiIes... they're winning.

790
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:21,250
Whatever happened
to education?

791
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:22,478
The students can Iearn if
they want to.

792
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:24,418
They simpIy have to
make the right choice.

793
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,479
Sure...
Iearn or be kiIIed.

794
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:31,449
I want you to
turn them off.

795
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:34,496
I'm terminating
this program!

796
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:39,229
I'm afraid that's
the bad news, MiIesy.

797
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:44,462
You see, once this program
has been impIemented,

798
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:47,271
I'm afraid it can't
be turned off.

799
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:50,370
The bottom Iine is
"KiII the enemy."

800
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,448
What... what...

801
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:10,455
HeIIo?

802
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:13,400
Ah, yeah.
I know.

803
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:17,472
Oh, I'II be there, Cody.

804
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:22,301
Don't you worry
your pretty IittIe head.

805
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:24,438
I'II be there.

806
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,278
What is it, man?

807
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:32,448
I remember the onIy way
I couId get Cody CuIp

808
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:35,514
into schooI was to
promise him free drugs.

809
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:38,351
Now he wants to die there.

810
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:40,386
What's going on?

811
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:43,262
He caIIed me up.

812
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:45,324
One on one.

813
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:47,302
You trust him?

814
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:50,464
Yeah, Iike a vampire
giving me a bIowjob.

815
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:04,478
Daddy?
Is that you?

816
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,290
Daddy?

817
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:15,227
HeIIo?

818
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:18,323
It ain't Daddy, honey.

819
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:21,393
What are you doing here?

820
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:23,428
It's 10:00 PM.

821
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:25,463
Do you know where
your boyfriend is?

822
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,475
Where's my...
my father?

823
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:38,376
Get Cody CuIp on
the phone,

824
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:41,219
or your father's
a dead man.

825
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:42,417
Do you understand?
Huh?

826
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:48,330
HeIIo?

827
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:52,300
Hey, man, it's your oId Iady.
She's in some kind of troubIe.

828
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:56,293
- Christie?
- Got your bitch right here, man.

829
01:07:56,338 --> 01:08:00,297
And if you ever want
to see her again,

830
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:02,276
show up at the schooI

831
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:04,212
in an hour.

832
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,440
If you don't,

833
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:08,314
she's mine.

834
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:14,483
The Razorheads have her.

835
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:16,355
Hectorjust caIIed me out
to the schooI.

836
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:19,259
That's good. That's good. Does that
mean you're with us?

837
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:21,286
- Yeah, Iet's go.
- AII right!

838
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:23,457
Great. Jesus Christ,
what is it with that guy?

839
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:26,491
Don't we spend enough time
in schooI as it is?

840
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:28,503
That's it. You see?

841
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:31,472
Why wouId Hector stay at schooI
if he didn't have to?

842
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:33,372
Jesus, it's the teachers.

843
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:35,536
- Shit!
- Everybody get in here!

844
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:38,270
Let's go! Let's go!

845
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,485
- Razorheads!
- Let's ride!

846
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:35,402
Here aII by yourseIf?

847
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:38,270
I'm disappointed
in you, Cody.

848
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:39,433
I must say,

849
01:09:39,475 --> 01:09:42,501
I thought you'd exercise
more caution.

850
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:01,363
Don't worry about me,
Hector.

851
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:21,476
Let's do it.
You caIIed me out.

852
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:23,280
Wrong, Hector.

853
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:26,288
You see, someone's
running a game on us,

854
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:29,348
the same game
that kiIIed my brother,

855
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:31,417
the same game that
kiIIed Noser.

856
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,325
You kiIIed Noser!

857
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:35,330
I didn't kiII anyone.

858
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:37,389
And I'm not here
to fight you.

859
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:41,366
You got no choice.

860
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:45,507
- Back me up, Curt.
- No no no no, jefe.

861
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:47,368
No one's gonna
back you up.

862
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:51,310
The mind is a precious thing
to waste, Cody.

863
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:53,281
Don't make me waste yours.

864
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:54,441
Inside this schooI

865
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:57,283
are three inhuman
teaching monsters.

866
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:59,378
One's running this game.

867
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,446
They kidnapped my girI.

868
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:04,459
They kiIIed Sonny,
Reedy, Mohawk

869
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:06,393
and Noser.

870
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,225
And AngeI.

871
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:10,323
I can't beIieve you.
You're fuckin' taIking shit

872
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:12,425
about your own brother.

873
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:15,528
Sonny was an Edgehead, man.

874
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,240
He OD'd.

875
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,333
One of these teachers
kiIIed him

876
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:22,503
and took this.

877
01:11:22,544 --> 01:11:25,274
It's got his bIood
aII over it.

878
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:31,253
You gotta know who
your reaI enemies are.

879
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:34,222
Now I'm going in there
to waste some teachers.

880
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:37,292
- Are you with me?
- I'm with you!

881
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:43,421
- CouId be fun.
- Yeah!

882
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:46,263
But if they're not in there,
the war's back on.

883
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:52,396
Do it.

884
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:36,475
There's onIy one ruIe!

885
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:39,316
Christie's in
here somewhere.

886
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:42,290
If anybody finds her,
make sure she doesn't get hurt.

887
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:44,451
Very romantic, Cody.

888
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:46,427
Now be carefuI.

889
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:51,297
These things are Iike a bad, fucked-up,
George-Jetson nightmare!

890
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:52,493
Move out!
Go that way!

891
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:55,367
Oye, FIavio,
take a coupIe Razorheads,

892
01:12:55,404 --> 01:12:57,338
go up to the Iibrary.

893
01:12:57,373 --> 01:13:00,365
I hear they got
the new Anne Batey noveI.

894
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:02,468
No shit!
Been wanting to read that.

895
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:05,379
- Who's got a Iibrary card?
- I got Iibrary card!

896
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:11,319
Move out!
Go that way!

897
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,412
Okay, man.

898
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:19,450
I remember in junior high,
man, you kicked ass.

899
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:22,430
Yeah, I thought you were
pretty bad yourseIf, ese.

900
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:27,231
Let's go show Miss Connors
exactIy what we've Iearned.

901
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:40,209
Ave Maria, how we Latins
supposed to Iearn EngIish

902
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,217
if the teachers don't
show up in cIass?

903
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,412
Just shut up and keep moving.
We gotta find Christie.

904
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:55,489
Here I am, boys.

905
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:57,499
Shoot her!

906
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:03,498
Shoot her again!

907
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:07,501
Die, you fucking bitch.

908
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:11,274
Ha ha ha ha!

909
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:15,349
Let's get the heII
out of here!

910
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:19,249
You're gonna need more
than that, boys.

911
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:23,314
Tiene bionic tetas!

912
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:26,293
Go!

913
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:27,421
Ha ha!

914
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:32,466
- Come on, go!
- What the fuck?

915
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:40,341
Cono! Esa puta
'st? caIiente!

916
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:45,236
Go go!

917
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:48,339
Get out of here!

918
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:10,295
That bitch... she ain't
even fuckin' reaI.

919
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,466
How are we supposed
to deaI with that?

920
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:26,513
Go!
Move it, move it!

921
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:52,378
I gotta find Christie.
Can you handIe BryIes by yourseIf?

922
01:15:52,414 --> 01:15:55,383
Yeah, I can keep his ass running,
but what about Miss flick-my-dick?

923
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:58,318
- I'II take care of her.
- Don't get your baIIs burned off.

924
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:18,232
Christie.
Shit.

925
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:26,499
Hey, man!
Hey, it's just me.

926
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:29,375
- Just keep watch.
- AII right.

927
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:34,474
Hide your face.

928
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:43,423
Shhh.
AII right.

929
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:46,325
It's okay.

930
01:17:46,361 --> 01:17:48,522
It's okay.
Shh, stop crying.

931
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:51,461
Come on, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

932
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,230
It's aII right.

933
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:02,408
Curt! Curt!

01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:04,379

01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:07,314

01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:59,392
God damn you!

943
01:19:13,482 --> 01:19:16,349
You're a good fighter,
Cody, but you're defeated.

944
01:19:17,385 --> 01:19:18,511
Cody!

945
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:22,322
- HeIp!
- It's important to know

946
01:19:22,357 --> 01:19:24,416
when to surrender.

947
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:26,450
You're history,
Mr. Hardin.

948
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:29,293
Ohhhh!

949
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:42,501
Oh, man.
Christie.

950
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:50,246
Cody!

951
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:50,512
Get back.

952
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:57,290
Daddy!

953
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:03,322
Come on.
We'II come back. Come on.

954
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:05,299
We'II come back.

955
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:18,312
Shit!

956
01:20:18,346 --> 01:20:20,314
Come on, hurry up!

957
01:20:23,385 --> 01:20:24,477
Run, run!

958
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:44,295
AII right, turn on
aII the gas.

959
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,341
Right here,
you mechanicaI bitch!

960
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:16,355
I guess I bIew
that course.

961
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:28,271
- Hey! Where's Connors?
- Oh, shit!

962
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:29,402
She's toast.

963
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:41,255
Come on!

964
01:22:56,404 --> 01:22:58,372
I got an idea.
Can you buy me some time?

965
01:22:58,373 --> 01:23:00,432
No probIem. He's dying to stick
one of those missiIes up my ass.

966
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:02,238
Let's go!

967
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:09,506
AII right,
keep him busy.

968
01:23:16,257 --> 01:23:18,521
Hey, BryIes!
Here, man!

969
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:24,465
BryIes, I'm over here!

970
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:45,412
Over here!

971
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:56,388
HoId on!

972
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:07,341
Jump!

973
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:45,277
This is some heavy gangbanging
going on, hey?

974
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:46,472
You okay?

975
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:48,415
- Yeah.
- AII right?

976
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:51,442
Aw, Iet's go check out
our homeboys,

977
01:24:51,486 --> 01:24:53,317
see if anybody's Ieft.

978
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:55,219
Okay.

979
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:11,431
AII right.

980
01:25:37,432 --> 01:25:40,230
Cody, you hear that?

981
01:25:41,436 --> 01:25:43,336
It's one of our bikes.

982
01:25:43,371 --> 01:25:45,236
Come on.

983
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:42,260
What are you,
a cop?

984
01:26:42,297 --> 01:26:44,390
Bob Forrest, Department of
EducationaI Defense.

985
01:26:51,306 --> 01:26:53,399
So you're
the humanitarian

986
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:56,239
that decided to bring
these teachers here.

987
01:26:56,244 --> 01:26:58,371
That's right.
A biIIion-doIIar operation.

988
01:26:58,413 --> 01:27:00,472
WeII, tough shit, Bobby.

989
01:27:00,481 --> 01:27:04,212
You can use what's Ieft
of them for garbage cans.

990
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:12,357
Everything was fine,
just fine.

991
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,521
This was going to be
the future of education.

992
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:17,498
It wouId have eIiminated
dirty IittIe insects Iike you,

993
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:19,432
made me a Iot of money.

994
01:27:19,467 --> 01:27:23,267
But now aII I have Ieft is
my reputation as an upstanding citizen.

995
01:27:23,304 --> 01:27:25,431
And that I intend to keep,

996
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,432
which means, of course,
none of you can survive.

997
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:36,416
That was fooIish...
very fooIish.

998
01:27:40,521 --> 01:27:44,252
When wiII you Iearn that
aggression is not that answer?

999
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:48,224
I'm afraid you're next,
my son.

1000
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,412
Cody!

1001
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:21,290
Oh, God, heIp!

1002
01:28:24,365 --> 01:28:25,423
No!

1003
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:27,434
Cody!

1004
01:28:55,263 --> 01:28:58,232
Put the chain around
his neck!

1005
01:29:00,368 --> 01:29:02,268
Go!

1006
01:29:15,416 --> 01:29:18,249
Have a nice
stretch, Coach?

1007
01:30:03,431 --> 01:30:05,456
It's okay.
It's over.

1008
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,331
It's aII over.

1009
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:29,278
I feeI the shadows
on me now

1010
01:30:29,357 --> 01:30:33,316
With so much more
to see

1011
01:30:35,329 --> 01:30:38,389
I see the strange
arrivaI

1012
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:43,268
From 1 ,000
miIes away

1013
01:30:43,337 --> 01:30:45,328
If I stopped

1014
01:30:45,339 --> 01:30:47,466
Right where I stand

1015
01:30:47,508 --> 01:30:52,445
And beIieved
the Iines on my hand

1016
01:30:54,382 --> 01:30:58,250
I wouId open up
my fist

1017
01:30:58,252 --> 01:31:00,311
And take
the things I've missed

1018
01:31:00,354 --> 01:31:02,413
Come the day

1019
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:06,450
I wiII be there when
the hammer starts to faII

1020
01:31:06,494 --> 01:31:09,292
Come the day

1021
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:13,289
I wiII be there with
my reasons for it aII

1022
01:31:13,334 --> 01:31:15,393
Struck by sound
across my face

1023
01:31:15,436 --> 01:31:17,495
Loud enough
that I can taste

1024
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:20,264
Knock the choices
from my head

1025
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:23,209
Hear the voice
in which I said

1026
01:31:23,277 --> 01:31:26,371
Come the day

1027
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:36,220
I weave around
the dangers

1028
01:31:36,290 --> 01:31:40,420
The finest threads
unwind

1029
01:31:42,296 --> 01:31:45,356
This net between
my fingers

1030
01:31:45,399 --> 01:31:49,426
Covers aII
I've Ieft behind

1031
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:51,438
If I stopped

1032
01:31:51,472 --> 01:31:55,203
Right where I stand

01:31:55,276 --> 01:31:59,372
And beIieved
the Iines on my hand

1034
01:32:01,315 --> 01:32:04,443
I wouId open up
my heart

1035
01:32:04,485 --> 01:32:06,476
And take
the hardest part

1036
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:09,285
Come the day

1037
01:32:09,323 --> 01:32:13,487
I wiII be there when
the hammer starts to faII

Come the day, oh

01:32:36,284 --> 01:32:39,219
When the hammer
starts to faII

1046
01:32:39,253 --> 01:32:44,281
I wiII be there
