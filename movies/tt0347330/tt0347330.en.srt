00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,994
<i>I was shocked when John Lennon died...</i>

3
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,292
<i>and also when Harrison died...</i>

4
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:38,570
<i>And if McCartney were to die...</i>

5
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:41,100
<i>I'd be very sad.</i>

6
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:44,471
<i>- What about Ringo?
- Ringo Starr, no...</i>

7
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,144
<i>It would be less...</i>

8
00:00:46,412 --> 00:00:49,245
<i>There's only one Stones song
that I don't like too much...</i>

9
00:00:49,415 --> 00:00:51,747
<i>it's Angie...
goes something like this...</i>

10
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,884
<i>It even reminds me of
The Beatles a bit, but...</i>

11
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:56,385
<i>I like it...</i>

12
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:59,023
<i>Yeah, well...
Sure, it goes well with...</i>

13
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,057
<i>Is that all you guys know?</i>

14
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:04,991
<i>- Do you know Dolly Parton?
- Who's Dolly Parton?</i>

15
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,358
<i>Well, Dolly Parton is a
great country singer.</i>

16
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,693
<i>But that's old music!</i>

17
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,871
<i>And the music you like is new?</i>

18
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,006
<i>That's cowboy music...</i>

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,208
<i>What I like about Mick Jagger
is that he proves...</i>

20
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,738
that you can get old and
still rock and roll...

21
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,878
You're right, he's our age.

22
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:23,107
And did you know I met him?

23
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:26,479
One day he was thirsty and went
to your house for a drink.

24
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:30,645
No, I went to his house...
in 1992 I was working at Securimax.

25
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:34,051
I took a suitcase to
his castle, in Touraine.

26
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,092
Does he live in Touraine?

27
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,457
Don't you think that France
is a beautiful country?

28
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,699
It's beautiful and big!

29
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:46,329
What an idiot... Take this...
and take this!

30
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,437
Write down his number, just in case...

31
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,770
Central, this is truck number eight.

32
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:03,114
THE MONEY TRUCK

33
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,325
<i>Yes?</i>

34
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:25,435
Alexandre Demarre...
They told me to come today.

35
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,308
Stop it with that, Dolph.

36
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:37,044
Shake it, shake it quickly...

37
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:40,309
that's what you have to do.

38
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,148
Have you ever gone through
a traumatizing experience?

39
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,687
No.

40
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,755
Are you married? Do you have children?

41
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,262
No.

42
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:56,730
I like that...
any psychiatric records?

43
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,337
No. I already answered those questions.

44
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,939
Each unit at the company
keeps its own records.

45
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,269
Let's see... no criminal background.

46
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,141
Perfect. Are you unemployed?

47
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,610
Yes.

48
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,943
You'll get a month's
contract to start off.

49
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,883
I'm sorry, but the
company was bought...

50
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,022
by the market leader...

51
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:19,724
so we're only hiring until
the end of the year.

52
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:22,690
But if you do your job well, nothing can
prevent you from a steady contract.

53
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,226
Don't tell the others,
but the last ones hired...

54
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,831
will not necessarily be the
first to get laid off.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,400
With this situation, morale is
low among the employees.

56
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,039
Go to the dressing room, one of your
work mates will take care of you.

57
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,105
Hurry up, you're late!

58
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:41,473
And if you have any problems,
you can come to me.

59
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,045
That's what I'm here for.

60
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,751
There won't be any problems, sir.

61
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,859
Don't bust my balls.

62
00:04:56,262 --> 00:05:00,460
- It's over now...
- Yes, it's over... over for us.

63
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,428
Because it's not 1, it's not 2,
it's not 3, we'll be left without...

64
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:09,664
- Is it African?
- Nah, Detroit, a remix...

65
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,275
- My name's Bernard...
- My name's Belette.

66
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,772
- I'm Alex.
- Let's see...

67
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,422
I'll give it back to his wife.

68
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,624
Sign here!

69
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,523
What's that?

70
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,461
A petition for training.

71
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,192
What training?

72
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,803
Do you think you can
start without training?

73
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,939
They make me laugh with the
six shooting sessions per year.

74
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,268
Policemen train six hour per week...

75
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,811
for at least a year.
Continuous training my ass!

76
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,419
Thanks. Welcome to Vigilante.

77
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,117
Jacques, come see. I have
something to show you.

78
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,802
- Who are you?
- Excuse me, I'm new.

79
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,978
Let's go. We're very busy.

80
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,114
I didn't know there
were women here.

81
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,784
Just one!

82
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,585
Thank you.

83
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:40,698
Here, 92R 67. Remember the number.
It's your gun. Respect it.

84
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,466
Nicole, you're late again.

85
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,608
You got truck 3.

86
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,042
Three?

87
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,315
- Three?
- Yes.

88
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:12,730
- It's heavy.
- I know, eight kilos.

89
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,263
You can't wear it for driving,
but when...

90
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,198
the Americans take over, we'll
get nice new light ones.

91
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,541
- What are you doing?
- He's with me.

92
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,716
Hi, I'm Jacques,
I take care of newbies.

93
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,546
He's the Mummy.
It's not hard.

94
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,914
We load up, cruise, and then offload.

95
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,284
Go in front, take my place.

96
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,753
Don't play with that.

97
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,587
- Wake me up at the first stop!
- You can sleep a little.

98
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:21,199
- Where did you use to work?
- At a bank.

99
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:24,998
You do well to change jobs, there's
nothing worse than security guard.

100
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,195
You just stand there
waiting to get killed.

101
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,901
At least we can talk.

102
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,071
You'll like it.

103
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:36,671
- Do you have a C license?
- No.

104
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:41,952
Your salary is 1200 euros,
the driver gets 1350.

105
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,914
- And what does he do?
- Messenger.

106
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:48,652
He makes almost 1500. He earns more,
but it's more dangerous.

107
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,155
Have you been working
long for Vigilante?

108
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:55,095
Seven years... seven years, damn!

109
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,164
Who are the customers?

110
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,963
Dangerous neighborhoods,
small retailers.

111
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,404
We rarely carry big loads.

112
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:07,569
Bur I prefer it that way. The smaller
the load, the smaller the risk.

113
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:45,683
Go back to the truck.

114
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:47,847
- Hi.
- Hi.

115
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,630
Put the gun away,
you could get a warning.

116
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,114
Come on, give us the cash...

117
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,883
- You're an asshole!
- Mother fucker!

118
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,153
- Prick, give us the dough!
- Fucker!

119
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,581
- Shit face!
- Give us the money, shit face!

120
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,856
- Fucker!
- Mother fucker!

121
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,822
Fuck off!

122
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,132
You're not a man!

123
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,694
Let's go!

124
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,005
- He's gay.
- He'll fuck the other one.

125
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,005
He's a shit-faced faggot.

126
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:23,304
It's OK, let them have some fun.

127
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,881
Let's go!

128
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,710
Truck number 3, what's the
code for this week?

129
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:58,340
- Indigo.
- Right, Indigo.

130
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:04,914
- Are you married?
- No.

131
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,115
It's better that way,
she wouldn't stand it.

132
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,928
- Want some?
- What is it?

133
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:23,867
- They're like chocolates.
- No, thanks.

134
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,037
A Halouf special!

135
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,909
- Tell me, have you been robbed already?
- No.

136
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,210
And Vigilante?

137
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:39,151
Yeah, three times this year.
There's 200 hubs in France...

138
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,256
over 6000 security agents...

139
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,519
and it had to happen to us!

140
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,660
Do you think it's just coincidence?

141
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,298
Hand me the newspaper.
I haven't read my horoscope.

142
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:53,502
Our best trucks are not yet
up to the new standards.

143
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,797
Ours are not well armored.

144
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:58,302
When is that going to change?

145
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,772
Not before the Americans take over.

146
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:03,880
They're not even replacing
the ones that break down!

147
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:08,313
We transport millions and
the company is crap!

148
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,384
What's your Zodiac sign?

149
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,819
Shut up, Dolph.

150
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,323
So, what do you think of the job?

151
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:17,859
Not bad.

152
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:19,994
Are you going to work
for the Americans?

153
00:13:20,165 --> 00:13:21,962
Why do you ask?

154
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,327
Dolph, the newbie wants to bet.

155
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:27,631
They sent someone last year,
before they bought Thטmox.

156
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,774
They believed there were moles...

157
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,374
so they wanted to clean up,
it's normal.

158
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,205
They should have investigated
the management...

159
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,507
every time they've had
complicity problems...

160
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,741
the problem was upstairs.

161
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,821
20 euros.

162
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,163
- It's all I have left.
- I'll pay it back.

163
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,964
- And mine?

164
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,465
- And what?
- Mine.

165
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,160
I'll think about it.

166
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,866
Sign, even the newbies have to sign.

167
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,870
Stop busting our balls
with that petition.

168
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,699
Where are you going?
Need a ride?

169
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,736
No, I'll walk a bit to relax.

170
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,002
- You sure?
- Yeah. Bye.

171
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,406
Bye.

172
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,338
Arlette is free, if you want.

173
00:14:43,615 --> 00:14:46,015
- Don't start with that, Jacques!
- It was you who asked me.

174
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,314
- Nice guy, eh?
- Yeah.

175
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,748
You saw it, he signed!

176
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,669
- How long will you be staying?
- A month.

177
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,070
Here.

178
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,171
- Have you seen Isabelle?
- No.

179
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,981
Damn!

180
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,175
That'll be 1450 euros.

181
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,352
Room 652, north side.

182
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:06,197
Please... I don't want anyone
entering my room, ever.

183
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,897
- Sure.
- Thank you.

184
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,738
Thank you, Isabelle.

185
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,670
How do you know my name?

186
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,604
MICHEL POITRENAUD,
NICK MOMIA.

187
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,002
JACQUES MAZARD,
NICK JACKPOT.

188
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,039
RָMY BLOSSIER,
NICK BUTAGAZ.

189
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,145
PIERRE LUKOWSKI,
DRIVER...

190
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,457
Thank you.

191
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,505
Fiat? 1962/1500?

192
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:12,505
Know it? It'll be a beauty.

193
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:15,406
Stop bugging us with
that old lemon.

194
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:19,481
Do something useful.
I'm talking to you.

195
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:24,320
Damn! Is that the load?

196
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,586
Why don't we ever see the money?

197
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:29,317
- To avoid temptation.
- They think of everything.

198
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,529
You'll see how it is. Let's go.

199
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,795
Electricity is the worst...

200
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,041
they connect a high voltage
wire to the truck...

201
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,572
you get 20000 volts up your ass.

202
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,178
Not everyone can buy a flamethrower.

203
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,246
I can get you one for 12000 francs...

204
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,247
a grenade for 100 euros...
made in France.

205
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,448
Nowadays every punk in
the bad neighborhoods...

206
00:21:29,654 --> 00:21:32,646
wants to rob a cash truck.
They're even using pit-bulls.

207
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,324
Belette, what are you doing?
We'll be late.

208
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,888
OK, it's loaded.

209
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,197
I'll show you a trick.

210
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:57,940
Give me.

211
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,148
Yours. Have a hit.

212
00:22:22,073 --> 00:22:24,405
Good, isn't it?

213
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,641
We have to go.

214
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:42,854
Where were you? I've been
waiting for 20 minutes.

215
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,430
Are you new?

216
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,357
Where did they find you?

217
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,798
Fuck! I only have coins...

218
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:57,272
Let's move on, I have
other things to do.

219
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:01,676
Next time, I'll file a report.

220
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,778
You could at least say goodbye!

221
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:07,911
Don't close the door.

222
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,848
Come, this way...

223
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,556
I'll show you something nice...

224
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:18,523
look everyone in the eye...

225
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,697
see how they get paranoid.

226
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,241
Let's fucking go!

227
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,377
Can he come out of the truck?

228
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,910
After fifteen years, he can
fuck with the rules.

229
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:47,078
No! No!

230
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:53,482
Check out the reflexes!
Son and grandson of a cop.

231
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,854
Why aren't you a cop?

232
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,961
- I didn't pass the test.
- Shame.

233
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,992
But I have my contacts.

234
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,129
The best suppliers in Paris!

235
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,268
Come on, get in the truck!

236
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,664
What's my name?

237
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,872
Bernard.

238
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,177
Get in!

239
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:19,108
- Is that all?
- They didn't pay it all.

240
00:26:21,946 --> 00:26:23,846
Let's go.

241
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:35,053
A real crisis! Can't even sell dope.

242
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:57,381
Hell, I said just one
bullet for each one.

243
00:26:59,984 --> 00:27:01,781
Your turn, Butagaz.

244
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:13,357
- You're fucking crazy...
- Shut up.

245
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,497
Very good, Nicole.

246
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,710
William Tell...

247
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,986
- You could take this seriously.
- I don't like it.

248
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,496
I'll donate my bullet to the newbie.

249
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:56,702
Come, your turn.

250
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,281
Don't worry.

251
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:18,427
Start low...
and stretch out your arm.

252
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:27,363
Right on the leg...
she won't get away.

253
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,676
We were in the parking lot...

254
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:37,178
and I thought she'd
kill my piece.

255
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:39,879
A piece like this.

256
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,182
- Your change.
- Thanks.

257
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:50,859
- See you.
- See you.

258
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,466
Can I ask you a question?

259
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:59,326
Yes.

260
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,562
Which are the dangerous spots?

261
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,867
There are rounds that are
more dangerous, right?

262
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,211
Are you here for the adrenaline?

263
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:09,436
A bit, yes.

264
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:13,717
Since I started working here,
I've never pulled out my gun.

265
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:18,284
You were lucky, we've had
three attacks this year.

266
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,081
Do you think they're the same people?

267
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,387
They've already killed nine
agents and two civilians.

268
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:26,655
They don't leave witnesses.

269
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:29,390
If the bastards close me in,
I'll get them.

270
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,667
Anyway, we're all going to
die one way or another, right?

271
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,238
No.

272
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:39,970
See you.

273
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,974
<i>- Any news from management?
- Nothing.</i>

274
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,777
<i>You're not at risk.</i>

275
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:17,337
- Everything OK?
- Yeah.

276
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:19,845
- Did you ride with Bernard today?
- Yes.

277
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:23,717
The old generation.
The NCO's on their last tour.

278
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,048
Don't mind him, he's sick.

279
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,987
Tell me, are small
loads less of a risk?

280
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:32,754
They're small now, but in
a month it'll be Christmas.

281
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,923
It'll be hot then.

282
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,400
<i>Anybody there?</i>

283
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,015
<i>It's pretty slow, we're in
the middle of a recession...</i>

284
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,387
<i>they'll decide, at last,
to lower the lending rates.</i>

285
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:12,925
Immediately there'll
be short-term fluctuations...

286
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,531
in the stock exchange...

287
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,668
that's my specialty, understand?

288
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:19,826
There's a storm at the office.
I asked for a few days off...

289
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,402
to be with you, but it's not possible.

290
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,768
It's the situation...
there's a small event...

291
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:29,343
within the economic environment,
and you have to react quickly.

292
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,981
You always admired my work...

293
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:34,548
even without understanding it.

294
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:37,277
When I used to say that you had won,
or that I had won...

295
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:41,616
were you proud of me?

296
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:45,758
It's the same thing now,
you'll be proud of me...

297
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:49,760
you just have to rest.

298
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:54,501
I won't be long, just a
call and I'll be back.

299
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:58,299
I can come early in the
morning or late in the evening.

300
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:05,710
Isabelle?

301
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:19,163
I've just finished, darling.

302
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,049
INCREDIBLE ROBBERY

303
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:48,789
ANOTHER ARMORED TRUCK ROBBERY

304
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,879
- Hello.
- Hello.

305
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,857
Sir, in three weeks you haven't
had any guests...

306
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:05,221
and I can't clean up...
Are you hiding?

307
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,827
No.

308
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:10,362
- Are you a cop?
- No.

309
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,662
- Will you be around for the holidays?
- Yes.

310
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:16,065
Could you lend me some money?

311
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,332
I'll pay it back when I get paid.

312
00:36:20,544 --> 00:36:22,239
How much do you need?

313
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,675
50 euros. It's for my son's gift.

314
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,281
I have to buy it now,
there won't be any left later.

315
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,987
- I just have this.
- Thank you.

316
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:35,591
See you later.

317
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,899
Damn!

318
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:47,162
This collar isn't new.

319
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:50,574
- It's still got bullet marks.
- Stop talking bullshit!

320
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:52,332
- Sign here.
- What is it?

321
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,511
A petition from the union
for a year's end bonus.

322
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:57,111
No, I don't want complications.

323
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:59,181
Don't come crying later.

324
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,510
Stop busting our balls
with your petition!

325
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,220
You test my patience.

326
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:07,419
Can you take a pic?

327
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,923
What a riot.

328
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,591
Another one, please.

329
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,030
Thanks.

330
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,303
It's all ruined.

331
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:40,285
- What's your name?
- Leave me alone.

332
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:51,829
- General Belledent Square...
- Aren't you wearing a vest?

333
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:54,094
So I get my head blown off?

334
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,499
You're going with Nicole and Alex.

335
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,741
Make a group of four
for the supermarket.

336
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:00,567
- I'll take care of the newbies.
- Cut it out.

337
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,871
In ten days the Americans
will bring their instructors...

338
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,412
might as well get used to it.
I don't want newbies at a Dakar!

339
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,813
- What's a Dakar?
- A dangerous route.

340
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,245
I would be violent to a virgin.

341
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,985
Are you Nicole?
I'm Karim.

342
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,117
You'll see!

343
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:27,327
10 minutes early...
it doesn't matter.

344
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:36,575
Come on, I haven't got all day.
Stop taking Prozac, idiot.

345
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,780
Saying Merry Christmas
is not a big effort...

346
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,245
The door!

347
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:45,787
Cunts!

348
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:52,488
Is it true the company will be sold?

349
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:54,330
- Yeah.
- So what do you think?

350
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:55,895
Nothing.

351
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,665
Thanks.

352
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,070
Alexandre!

353
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:19,647
Hey, newb, that place is taken!

354
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:57,191
Nicole, what are you doing tonight?

355
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,495
Want some?

356
00:40:01,131 --> 00:40:04,430
- What's the effect?
- Relaxing...

357
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,371
Take two...

358
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:13,275
it's great.

359
00:40:28,158 --> 00:40:32,652
- Do you know that guy?
- I don't know.

360
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:37,567
- How did you wind up here?
- Depression.

361
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,803
Poor you...

362
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:45,699
Aren't you fed up with this job?

363
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,874
You know, they will fire me...

364
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,273
so I couldn't give a fuck.

365
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:02,448
It's a nice load, ain't it?

366
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:07,019
It would be a nice goodbye.

367
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,501
Don't tell me you never thought
about it. We're all the same.

368
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:17,996
It's just a bag. That makes
me feel less stupid.

369
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:26,211
I wouldn't even know
what to do with it.

370
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:33,246
With all these robberies,
do you think...

371
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:35,652
it's an inside job?

372
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:42,126
Four of five years ago I would
have said no, but now...

373
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:45,831
they even hire Arabs.

374
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:52,131
Nicole, just between you and I...
is it true that you're a dyke?

375
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,446
The bonuses!

376
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:59,311
75 euros each!

377
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:02,048
- Thanks.
- Give me two.

378
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,555
Who's first?

379
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,585
Thanks...

380
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:11,052
Will we earn more with the Americans?

381
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:12,886
We're negotiating.

382
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,722
- Will you go on with your politics?
- I want to!

383
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,035
Give me the keys to the locker,
I think I forgot to remove...

384
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:22,237
the bullets from my gun.
Someone could get hurt.

385
00:42:25,275 --> 00:42:27,641
Who's that for?

386
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,773
Come Marilyn, come, please.

387
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:34,607
Come, please... come.

388
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,114
Make the best of it. I won't
be here next year.

389
00:42:39,289 --> 00:42:41,985
- Will you be in prison?
- Might be.

390
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,888
I'm going to sell cocaine.
I have a good plan.

391
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,753
Great!

392
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,596
Have you seen Alex?

393
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,863
- And do you have something lined up?
- Yes.

394
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:43,572
Hang on, I'm calculating...

395
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,409
wait... wait...

396
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:51,511
The cell phone is new, I don't
know how it works...

397
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,848
yeah, like this... wait...

398
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:58,090
Listen, I can't say.
3.8, 3.9, depends.

399
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:01,792
I don't know... with the
European tax, it will be...

400
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:06,527
well, yes, they're right:
15. 15 or 16...

401
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:10,364
I don't know! I honestly don't know...

402
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:12,973
I would have to...
hang on...

403
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:15,404
I can calculate that...

404
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,849
Sorry, I've just been
attacked by a tiger...

405
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,143
Yes, a forest tiger.

406
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:23,876
Have you peed already, tiger?

407
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:26,850
I don't mean you,
I'll call you later, bye.

408
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:29,752
First one to buckle up...
Attention 1, 2, 3, now.

409
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:49,303
You like to pounce on me
when I'm on the phone.

410
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,677
You can't attack me like that.

411
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:06,262
I'm going to call your mother
to tell her we're on our way.

412
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,163
What's this?

413
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:22,136
What's he doing? Come on,
get out of the way...

414
00:46:27,979 --> 00:46:31,813
What's he doing?
Buckle your belt, buckle your belt...

415
00:46:35,286 --> 00:46:37,686
Go, dad!

416
00:46:37,922 --> 00:46:40,186
No, stay still...

417
00:48:51,655 --> 00:48:54,351
Your envelope, you earned it.

418
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,030
And who are you?

419
00:49:08,672 --> 00:49:10,435
Ask me to dance?

420
00:49:28,425 --> 00:49:30,655
I was getting worried.

421
00:49:31,162 --> 00:49:32,720
Why?

422
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:34,759
You've been here for a month...

423
00:49:34,999 --> 00:49:37,763
and today was the first time
we worked together.

424
00:49:40,971 --> 00:49:42,700
What are you doing here?

425
00:49:43,073 --> 00:49:45,439
Same as you, earning a living.

426
00:49:46,677 --> 00:49:48,508
You have delicate hands.

427
00:50:57,147 --> 00:50:59,115
What are you doing here?

428
00:51:00,618 --> 00:51:03,883
Are you a journalist... writer?

429
00:51:09,493 --> 00:51:12,985
I requested that no
one enter my room.

430
00:51:15,499 --> 00:51:18,059
OK, I got it.

431
00:51:24,541 --> 00:51:26,304
What's that scar?

432
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:27,872
Please.

433
00:51:29,146 --> 00:51:30,443
See you later, sir.

434
00:52:21,231 --> 00:52:25,065
You talking to me?

435
00:52:25,336 --> 00:52:27,270
You talking to me?
Speak to Kelem!

436
00:52:27,538 --> 00:52:29,130
Speak, then!
Speak, then!

437
00:52:29,406 --> 00:52:31,306
Stop that.

438
00:52:32,009 --> 00:52:34,637
Show some respect for the dead...
damn it!

439
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:39,015
- Shut the fuck up!
- Fuck you!

440
00:52:45,189 --> 00:52:46,918
Stop.

441
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:52,458
- What's going on?
- He called him a snitch.

442
00:52:52,696 --> 00:52:54,027
- Who?
- The old man.

443
00:52:54,298 --> 00:52:56,289
If he killed himself, it's because
he felt guilty about something.

444
00:52:56,567 --> 00:52:58,762
- You're a bastard.
- Calm down...

445
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:02,505
Whoever wants to fight,
come to the hall with me...

446
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,833
Fights should be in a ring.

447
00:53:05,042 --> 00:53:06,873
Give me your hands.

448
00:53:08,012 --> 00:53:09,536
All right...

449
00:53:40,778 --> 00:53:42,871
<i>This week's password is "Carmim".</i>

450
00:53:43,781 --> 00:53:47,080
You're getting on my nerves
with your fucking passwords.

451
00:53:50,421 --> 00:53:53,515
- Calm down a bit.
- I'm not an idiot.

452
00:54:24,021 --> 00:54:27,855
Alex! Come see. We're going
to do some wrecking.

453
00:54:30,627 --> 00:54:33,118
Watch out... Calm down.

454
00:54:33,363 --> 00:54:35,194
I missed the two targets.

455
00:54:35,432 --> 00:54:37,900
So they can go jerk off at home.

456
00:54:39,336 --> 00:54:42,134
Alex, did I tell you what
happened to my leg?

457
00:54:42,372 --> 00:54:44,932
- Three times...
- This will be the fourth.

458
00:54:49,012 --> 00:54:51,503
It was in Sudan, with
my friend Gerbier...

459
00:55:03,494 --> 00:55:05,587
- Don't move.
- Get out!

460
00:55:08,999 --> 00:55:13,493
Get out... don't be idiots,
it's not your money.

461
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:20,271
You! Get out!

462
00:55:20,511 --> 00:55:22,877
Damn, I can't believe...

463
00:55:23,147 --> 00:55:26,241
- Don't shoot, we'll come out.
- Shut up!

464
00:55:26,517 --> 00:55:28,610
Out! Out!

465
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:32,115
I'll show'em...

466
00:55:36,927 --> 00:55:38,485
Charles Martel!

467
00:55:44,234 --> 00:55:46,668
This is truck 5,
we're being attacked...

468
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:49,395
Don't be an idiot, let's
avenge our colleagues.

469
00:55:49,573 --> 00:55:51,268
Let's go.

470
00:55:55,179 --> 00:55:57,340
What are you doing? Fuck!

471
00:55:57,548 --> 00:55:59,516
Let's go.

472
00:56:01,552 --> 00:56:02,883
Let's go.

473
00:56:49,032 --> 00:56:51,023
Come back here, motherfuckers.

474
00:57:34,578 --> 00:57:36,569
You're not at fault at all.

475
00:57:37,614 --> 00:57:40,242
On the contrary, it was
legitimate defense.

476
00:57:42,486 --> 00:57:44,386
I didn't mean to do it.

477
00:57:48,258 --> 00:57:51,421
And you scared them off.

478
00:57:54,164 --> 00:57:55,791
I killed a kid.

479
00:58:01,138 --> 00:58:04,335
That kid, no doubt, took part
in other robberies...

480
00:58:04,841 --> 00:58:08,834
in which nine... ten men
were killed, including today.

481
00:58:10,814 --> 00:58:12,679
How can you know?

482
00:58:19,222 --> 00:58:21,520
All the men that quit...

483
00:58:21,792 --> 00:58:24,727
after events like today's later
became depressed.

484
00:58:25,729 --> 00:58:28,220
And if you stay, you'll be
a professional hero.

485
00:58:28,498 --> 00:58:30,932
I'll talk with the new management.

486
00:58:31,168 --> 00:58:33,659
Your job is guaranteed.

487
00:58:39,142 --> 00:58:40,734
Can I leave now?

488
00:58:42,913 --> 00:58:46,474
It would be a shame to
lose you. Stay on.

489
00:58:48,518 --> 00:58:50,145
Tell Bernard to come in.

490
00:58:54,458 --> 00:58:58,258
He almost won the Paris
kickboxing title.

491
00:58:58,895 --> 00:59:00,988
And the Americans wanted him.

492
00:59:01,398 --> 00:59:03,764
- How do you know?
- He told me.

493
00:59:06,303 --> 00:59:08,669
Thanks for calling.

494
00:59:09,072 --> 00:59:12,439
The union has decided to go on strike.

495
00:59:12,709 --> 00:59:16,008
What for? The company's
closing down in a week.

496
00:59:16,213 --> 00:59:18,044
The Americans won't give a fuck.

497
00:59:18,382 --> 00:59:21,010
- It has to be this way.
- I can't stand any more burials!

498
00:59:21,551 --> 00:59:23,815
- What's wrong with you?
- Who will be next?

499
00:59:24,087 --> 00:59:27,147
- Stop that, Nicole.
- You're all the same.

500
00:59:27,724 --> 00:59:30,318
Those bastards left me on foot.

501
00:59:31,762 --> 00:59:34,993
And between work and dismissal,
do you think I'll choose work?

502
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:38,432
And you're all gonna
testify for me!

503
00:59:38,802 --> 00:59:40,133
Remi?

504
00:59:43,073 --> 00:59:44,631
Nicole?

505
00:59:47,177 --> 00:59:48,542
Francis?

506
00:59:50,113 --> 00:59:53,378
You were there! You can say it
wasn't my fault!

507
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:56,347
Everybody knows it was
your fault he died.

508
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:58,749
Bastard.

509
01:00:00,957 --> 01:00:03,619
Stop that!

510
01:00:04,494 --> 01:00:07,327
Leave that...

511
01:00:09,132 --> 01:00:11,293
- Is that the way it is?
- Yes, it is.

512
01:00:11,501 --> 01:00:13,025
All right...

513
01:00:28,118 --> 01:00:30,018
I think he's nervous...

514
01:00:32,155 --> 01:00:35,022
- He knows it's coming!
- What did they tell you?

515
01:00:35,992 --> 01:00:38,256
The usual bullshit.

516
01:00:39,095 --> 01:00:41,359
It's normal to be nervous.

517
01:00:43,266 --> 01:00:44,824
I'm quitting.

518
01:00:46,703 --> 01:00:49,228
Are you also leaving us?

519
01:00:49,873 --> 01:00:51,204
Yeah.

520
01:01:09,593 --> 01:01:11,083
Motherfuckers!

521
01:01:19,336 --> 01:01:21,896
It's a charter flight to Bangkok.
They're leaving tomorrow.

522
01:01:22,138 --> 01:01:24,163
I'm sorry, it's your last night...

523
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:29,374
- Where's Isabelle?
- Isn't she in the hall?

524
01:01:29,713 --> 01:01:32,079
If I find her, I'll kill her!

525
01:01:32,449 --> 01:01:35,077
Delphine, Delphine!

526
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:45,391
Let's go.

527
01:01:49,566 --> 01:01:51,466
Thank you.

528
01:01:53,537 --> 01:01:55,334
They're looking for you downstairs.

529
01:01:55,539 --> 01:01:58,531
So? Let them look.
Let's go.

530
01:02:01,645 --> 01:02:02,873
Miss.

531
01:02:15,959 --> 01:02:17,119
Give it to me.

532
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:25,190
What is it?

533
01:02:26,336 --> 01:02:28,861
I'd tell you Santa Claus,
if you believed in him.

534
01:03:16,653 --> 01:03:17,847
No.

535
01:03:19,089 --> 01:03:21,649
How did you get my number?

536
01:03:35,238 --> 01:03:38,833
- Sign here!
- What is it?

537
01:03:39,142 --> 01:03:41,406
- Petition for training.
- What training?

538
01:03:41,645 --> 01:03:44,978
Do you think it's normal to start
working without training?

539
01:03:45,248 --> 01:03:47,614
Don't bother me, I'm not interested.

540
01:03:48,585 --> 01:03:50,644
Don't come complaining later.

541
01:03:55,659 --> 01:03:57,923
The newbie didn't give you
the time of day.

542
01:03:58,228 --> 01:04:01,959
You can laugh, but they'll
give us the bonus!

543
01:04:02,165 --> 01:04:04,156
You'd do anything for a tip!

544
01:04:06,302 --> 01:04:08,600
What's going on?

545
01:04:11,307 --> 01:04:13,673
- It's a bitch...
- It's OK...

546
01:04:14,144 --> 01:04:15,736
They should have fired you.

547
01:04:16,012 --> 01:04:17,980
- Don't provoke me!
- Hi.

548
01:04:19,516 --> 01:04:21,575
It's good you came back!

549
01:04:26,489 --> 01:04:29,925
See, boy, this job sucks.

550
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,090
- The company's closing...
- Hey, mate.

551
01:04:33,296 --> 01:04:35,594
And perhaps next week
we'll all be unemployed.

552
01:04:35,965 --> 01:04:37,990
It's Christmas eve and
we'll have to work...

553
01:04:38,435 --> 01:04:41,302
Well, he came back, and that's good.

554
01:04:43,907 --> 01:04:47,001
I think you'll keep your job with 
the new company...

555
01:04:47,343 --> 01:04:50,972
we can work together.

556
01:04:58,722 --> 01:05:00,417
But this is just between you and I.

557
01:05:03,259 --> 01:05:05,090
Have you seen my console?

558
01:05:05,328 --> 01:05:07,421
Talking to me?
He's crazy.

559
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:09,655
- 92 B13, keep the number.
- Yeah...

560
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,466
- 92R.67
- Here.

561
01:05:12,669 --> 01:05:14,762
I wouldn't like to give it
to anyone else.

562
01:05:17,874 --> 01:05:20,604
Tonight, we'll celebrate
Christmas eve together.

563
01:05:20,877 --> 01:05:23,778
You must have a long story,
after all that happened.

564
01:05:24,013 --> 01:05:25,571
Me too.

565
01:05:26,449 --> 01:05:28,178
Bye, bye.

566
01:05:29,586 --> 01:05:31,349
Good day.

567
01:05:31,588 --> 01:05:32,987
Bye.

568
01:05:39,129 --> 01:05:41,723
I need to talk to you.

569
01:05:42,832 --> 01:05:45,630
Cut it out, I don't have
your game console.

570
01:05:48,638 --> 01:05:51,368
It's a long trip. It's going
to take me hours.

571
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:54,268
Bye, see you tonight.

572
01:05:55,211 --> 01:05:59,045
What a job. Nice, right?

573
01:05:59,249 --> 01:06:03,151
I'll take you out for a spin later.

574
01:06:04,587 --> 01:06:09,081
Alex, come, come with us...

575
01:06:11,161 --> 01:06:12,287
Please.

576
01:06:12,662 --> 01:06:14,857
Wait, we'll change...
take my place.

577
01:06:15,165 --> 01:06:16,894
Yes, that's right,
I spoke to the boss.

578
01:06:17,133 --> 01:06:19,761
- What the fuck?
- it's all right, we'll trade places.

579
01:06:20,036 --> 01:06:22,300
I wasn't going to leave
you with that idiot.

580
01:06:22,605 --> 01:06:24,368
Shit!

581
01:06:57,841 --> 01:07:00,002
Won't it bother you to have
to work for the Americans?

582
01:07:00,276 --> 01:07:02,176
- What about you?
- Yes, it will.

583
01:07:08,818 --> 01:07:12,720
I got everything...
Lotto, Super Bingo...

584
01:07:12,922 --> 01:07:16,858
Here, let's do it,
let's scratch them.

585
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:21,595
Nothing...

586
01:07:22,732 --> 01:07:24,427
nothing...

587
01:07:26,035 --> 01:07:27,832
Why did you come back?

588
01:07:28,104 --> 01:07:29,969
To work.

589
01:07:30,673 --> 01:07:32,698
Nothing for me?

590
01:07:33,509 --> 01:07:35,272
You won!

591
01:07:35,545 --> 01:07:38,013
We'll split it.

592
01:07:38,581 --> 01:07:40,208
OK.

593
01:08:09,078 --> 01:08:10,477
Where are we going?

594
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:12,748
We're going...

595
01:08:13,216 --> 01:08:15,377
to see some friends.

596
01:08:17,086 --> 01:08:21,580
Looks like you used to
have money before.

597
01:08:24,327 --> 01:08:26,659
Don't you need it?

598
01:08:28,998 --> 01:08:30,124
Yes.

599
01:08:49,552 --> 01:08:52,316
- We're wasting time.
- There's no hurry.

600
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:01,324
We're a bit late.
Where are you?

601
01:09:04,567 --> 01:09:07,593
- That was Nicole.
- What did she want?

602
01:09:07,804 --> 01:09:10,068
To kiss you. You'll be the first.

603
01:09:10,406 --> 01:09:11,600
Let's go!

604
01:09:32,295 --> 01:09:35,355
Your music is dull, Karim.

605
01:09:35,765 --> 01:09:37,426
Don't bust my balls.

606
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,825
I don't have to listen to that shit.

607
01:09:40,069 --> 01:09:42,230
No need to get angry,
life is beautiful.

608
01:09:51,848 --> 01:09:53,748
Did you follow me?

609
01:09:53,983 --> 01:09:56,474
Yes, I was intrigued.

610
01:09:58,988 --> 01:10:00,888
So, what do you say?

611
01:10:03,726 --> 01:10:05,853
I think you're here to start over.

612
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:09,361
Go on...

613
01:10:10,133 --> 01:10:13,068
And since I like you, I'll help you.

614
01:10:13,302 --> 01:10:17,466
- How?
- By introducing you to some friends.

615
01:10:19,442 --> 01:10:20,704
All right.

616
01:10:23,212 --> 01:10:24,543
Thanks.

617
01:10:28,284 --> 01:10:29,615
When?

618
01:10:36,459 --> 01:10:37,619
Now.

619
01:10:42,732 --> 01:10:44,427
What are you doing?

620
01:10:44,801 --> 01:10:47,429
At first, I thought you were
working for the Americans.

621
01:10:47,804 --> 01:10:50,102
- What are you doing, Jacques?
- And then I understood it was him.

622
01:11:34,917 --> 01:11:37,147
So what do you think?

623
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:40,483
All this money, all these days...
it's tempting.

624
01:11:41,357 --> 01:11:43,917
I tried to resist, I swear.

625
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:48,052
And one day I found them.
I couldn't help it...

626
01:11:50,099 --> 01:11:52,124
So, now it's simple...

627
01:11:52,502 --> 01:11:54,299
you're either rich...

628
01:11:54,604 --> 01:11:56,333
or an idiot.

629
01:11:57,807 --> 01:12:00,435
Truck number 3... password, "Carmin".

630
01:12:08,084 --> 01:12:11,542
You're lucky, if the
"Mummy" hadn't died...

631
01:12:11,888 --> 01:12:13,617
he'd be in your place.

632
01:12:24,233 --> 01:12:25,928
They're late.

633
01:12:26,402 --> 01:12:29,394
The boss promised to hire me back...

634
01:12:29,839 --> 01:12:35,300
Well, tonight I feel rather un-hired.

635
01:12:39,715 --> 01:12:43,310
Tonight...I'm taking it out!

636
01:12:43,786 --> 01:12:45,151
And you?

637
01:12:45,521 --> 01:12:49,082
I'll be with my wife,
you can come by.

638
01:12:49,292 --> 01:12:51,453
Depends... is she a good cook?

639
01:12:51,761 --> 01:12:53,991
Bernard is our best shooter...

640
01:12:54,263 --> 01:12:56,595
he's kind of stupid, but useful.

641
01:12:56,999 --> 01:13:00,059
If you stay with me in the truck,

Merry Christmas, Alex.

Shut your eyes.

Shit!

No... what are you doing?

01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:06,988
Stop that, Alex, what are you doing?

649

I don't want to kill you.
Stop it!

I don't want to kill you... stop it!
