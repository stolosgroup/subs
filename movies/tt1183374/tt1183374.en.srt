00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,829
Morning, guys.
How's it going?

3
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:02,504
Bailey, what's up? What's up?

4
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:05,205
Hey, Chewie. Hey, Watson.
How's it going?

5
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,996
Looking good. Queenie. Rascal.

6
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,210
Yeah. OK.

7
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:13,221
Who wants some food?
Who wants some food?

8
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:16,604
Wolf it down. That's it.
That's all you get.

9
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,142
Water?

10
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:29,527
How are you?

11
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:32,572
There she is. There she is.

12
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:35,526
OK. Alright, Lexi. Alright. Hey.

13
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:39,829
Back it up. Back it up.
Hey, Lexi. Back it up.

14
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,540
Oh, hey! Hey! Hey. Big doggie.

15
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:45,366
Big doggie. Big doggie.

16
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,662
Holly, right?

17
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,958
Holly Garling.

18
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,672
Hi. How are you?

19
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,593
Hi. I'm sorry.
Do we know each other?

20
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:35,263
- Oh, Seth. Westbrook High.
- Oh. Were you in my class?

21
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:38,144
I was in the year above you.
We didn't hang out or anything.

22
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,722
But I knew who you were.

23
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,557
You did?

24
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,182
Sure. Everybody did.

25
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,020
I don't know about that.

26
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,476
So you're a writer now, huh?

27
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:52,227
- That's cool. It's great.
- Yeah.

28
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,899
This whole waitress uniform,
it's... it's just a disguise.

29
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,371
It's convincing.

30
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,621
I was gonna order
an ice-cream sundae.

31
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:04,954
- Extra sprinkles.
- You wouldn't be the first.

32
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,546
- This is my stop.
- Oh, this is you?

33
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:19,723
- It was nice to see you again.
- Nice to see you too.

34
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,385
Hey, if you're not
doing anything...

35
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,853
..get a coffee?

36
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,762
Hm.

37
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:10,194
<i>We're looking at your numbers.</i>

38
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,232
Hey.

39
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:19,153
There he is.
There's the man.

40
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:27,905
Nate. Let me ask you
a question.

41
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,078
Mmm?

42
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:32,621
If there was this girl
and you wanted her to notice you...

43
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,841
- Are you serious right now?
- Yeah.

44
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,303
Shit, man, I don't know you.

45
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:41,224
I don't know what kind of game you got.
Why are you asking me?

46
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,143
Sorry. I thought maybe...

47
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,302
Listen. Wait.

48
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:47,011
You like this girl?

49
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,181
We are talking about
a girl here, right?

50
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,980
Yes, a girl. I do like her.

51
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,483
So just be confident, you know?

52
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,605
Guy who's confident,
knows how to make 'em laugh.

53
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:59,114
Tell 'em about your day,
acting like you give a shit.

54
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,236
I mean, it ain't a mystery.

55
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:05,073
Confident, funny, make 'em laugh.
Got it. Good. Thanks.

56
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,740
Hey. And no more
bringing this shit to me, alright?

57
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,660
You and me, we ain't like that.

58
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,119
Cool.

59
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,046
Seth, Dr Jessup needs your help.

60
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,674
He's putting down
the German shepherd in 34.

61
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,011
- Lexi.
- Look, you're a sweet guy.

62
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,427
If you can't do your job,
I'll find someone who can.

63
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:28,966
Is that clear?

64
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,889
She's... really good dog.

65
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,850
Hey, Lexi. Hey.

66
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,901
Here's the thing. We just...

67
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,855
Hey, girl.

68
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,235
Hey, Lexi.

69
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,197
Hey.

70
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:51,197
How's it going?
Want to go for a walk?

71
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,160
Hey. Hey. Hey.

72
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,710
Good girl. Yeah, it's exciting, isn't it?

73
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,384
Alright, Lexi. Here we go.

74
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,797
Alright. That's a good dog.

75
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,675
Yeah. That's a good dog.

76
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:07,092
- You alright?
- Yeah. She's just a good dog.

77
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,801
Shh. It's OK, Lexi.
It's alright.

78
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,471
You want her,
you can always keep her.

79
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,849
My building doesn't allow pets.
Very strict.

80
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,726
Fucking find a new place.

81
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,523
$9 an hour?
I'm lucky I have running water.

82
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,728
That's your whole problem.
You got no initiative.

83
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:23,238
It's how come you're still working
in a shithole like this at your age.

84
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:25,402
You want something in this life,
you gotta take it.

85
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,027
So, what's it gonna be?

86
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,448
I mean, you want her, she's yours.

87
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,615
Do it. Do it already.

88
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,535
Alright, Lexi. Here we go.
You're a good dog.

89
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,840
Hold still. You're a good dog.

90
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,521
Hey, Holly, hey.

91
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,395
What time do you get lunch?

92
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,772
What... time do you get lunch?

93
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,769
I get lunch at 1:00.

94
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,481
1:00.

95
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,071
Hey. Hey. Hi.

96
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,657
Hey.

97
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,992
Hey. Remember me?

98
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:19,118
That's right. Uh...

99
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:22,786
Well, I guess table for one
while I'm here, but...

100
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,626
..really, I was just wondering

101
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,381
if you wanted to get, maybe...
dinner later.

102
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:32,125
I, uh... I don't know about you,
but I love seafood.

103
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:36,179
Oh, you do? Yeah. That's all I eat.

104
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:37,965
Seafood, seafood...
There's a, uh...

105
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,808
There's a place on...
There's a place on...

106
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,805
There's a place on Wilshire
called The Crab Joint.

107
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:48,858
Oh, you know it?
Yeah, we could... Tonight?

108
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,937
It's, uh...

109
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,860
Hey, Holly. Hey.

110
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,699
Hey, Holly. How's it going?

111
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,244
Hey.

112
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,966
- Hi. Anywhere?
- Yeah. Anywhere is fine.

113
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,345
- Just...
- OK. Thanks.

114
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:35,449
Hey. How are you?
I'm Holly.

115
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:36,992
I'll be taking care
of you today.

116
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,615
You must be a writer.

117
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,702
- Sorry?
- A writer.

118
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,787
The, uh, disguise, from the bus.

119
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:48,001
We met a couple of days ago
on the bus.

120
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,956
- My name's Seth.
- I'm so sorry.

121
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:52,087
My memory, like,
totally sucks. I know.

122
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:54,254
Just what you want to hear
from your waiter, right?

123
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,169
No, that's fine.

124
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,403
Can I get you started with anything?
An appetiser? Or...?

125
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,387
Yeah. Um...

126
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:04,144
Let's, uh... Let's do water.

127
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,597
And then, by the time
you come back, I'll... I'll know.

128
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,649
- Water. Una agua. You got it.
- Hey, um...

129
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:14,864
I like your hair. It looks
different from... from the bus.

130
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,066
- It's nice. Yeah.
- Thank you.

131
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:21,067
You shouldn't feel insecure about it
or... self-conscious.

132
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:25,041
It's... It is a... a good haircut.

133
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:30,325
Why don't you take a look at the menu
and I will go grab your water.

134
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,840
Yeah. Pie.

135
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,883
Apple pie.

136
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,611
How's it going over here?

137
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,910
- Seth.
- What's that?

138
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,913
Seth. My name is Seth.

139
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,582
How's the food, Seth?

140
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,456
It's good. It's quality.

141
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,543
Actually, I had a question for you.

142
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,669
Do you like Ben Folds?

143
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:17,166
'Cause I have a couple of tickets
to his concert this week

144
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:20,379
and the girl I was gonna go with -
not a girlfriend or anything -

145
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,220
she can't make it,
she has a thing.

146
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,965
I was wondering
if maybe you'd want to...

147
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,518
..go?

148
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,061
I'm sorry, I can't.

149
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:29,725
I don't like going to shows
by myself.

150
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,733
It feels kind of strange, you know?
So maybe...

151
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,942
Not a big deal. No pressure.
We could just go.

152
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,015
Wouldn't have to be
a date or anything.

153
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,691
The thing is, I already
sort of have a boyfriend, so...

154
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,030
No, you don't.

155
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:46,908
Just gonna leave this here.

156
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:50,077
- Thanks for coming in.
- Hang on... a second.

157
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:01,364
<i>But, like, when they
do speak, you know you're in trouble.</i>

158
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,066
Hey.

159
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:07,988
- There's a guy out there.
- Ooh. Is he hot?

160
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:12,118
- I'm serious, Claire.
- Don't get paranoid on me, Hol.

161
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,327
You're no fun when you're paranoid.

162
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:17,327
Never mind.

163
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,460
10 bucks says it's him.

164
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,761
- Yes, Eric.
- Hey, babe.

165
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,675
What do you want?

166
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,263
Jesus! What's with the attitude?
I just wanted to talk.

167
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,059
- I've been thinking about you.
- Is he drunk and weepy again?

168
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,933
A little bit.

169
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,850
Who are you talking to?
You with someone?

170
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,849
Don't get paranoid on me, Eric.

171
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,901
You're no fun
when you're paranoid.

172
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,991
So, the other night with Eric?

173
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:54,119
Really? Are we gonna go there again?

174
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,327
He was two years. You can't
convince me he never mattered.

175
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,579
I'm serious, though, Hol.

176
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:03,001
Being alone is just... kinda shitty.

177
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,681
So, what, I'm just supposed
to forget everything he did?

178
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:10,551
Yes. Forget, forgive.
Move the fuck on already.

179
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,100
Just go back to the way things were.

180
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,765
You know I can't do that.

181
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,703
To us.

182
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,447
Hey, Sam.

183
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,788
- Someone's popular.
- What?

184
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,707
We put it
in the break room.

185
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,170
OK...

186
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,726
Lucky bitch.

187
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,860
Spill. Who's the guy?

188
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,666
- Hey.
- Hey.

189
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,340
Listen. I'm so sorry
for the drunk dial the other night.

190
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,924
- I mean, you know how it is.
- Yeah, I do.

191
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,760
Listen. Can I get you a beer
or something?

192
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:36,346
Eric. You have to stop
doing stuff like this.

193
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,684
Stuff like... What now?

194
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,601
Come on.

195
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,940
Roses? You know they're my favourite.

196
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:47,225
I didn't know that.

197
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,910
OK. Well, now I just feel stupid.

198
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,992
- I should go.
- Just one beer.

199
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:59,164
It wasn't all bad, right?
We had some good times.

200
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,669
Yep.

201
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,582
So, why don't we
give it another shot?

202
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:09,214
Are you really gonna make me
say her name?

203
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:14,256
..thousand times,
and you know if I could take it back,

204
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,097
I would, in a heartbeat.

205
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,023
This is so fucking stupid.

206
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:22,814
I mean, we had something.

207
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,347
Had.

208
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,061
Eric, past tense.

209
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,277
I'm gonna get some air.

210
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,506
Nice night.

211
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,889
- Yeah.
- Yep.

212
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,480
- Not a smoker?
- Me? No.

213
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,935
That's good. Don't ever start.
It's a terrible habit.

214
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,200
OK, I won't.

215
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,032
Thanks.

216
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:33,511
- Have a nice night.
- You like the flowers?

217
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:37,182
You seemed like a red-and-white
roses kind of girl.

218
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,143
- It was just a guess.
- Oh, my God.

219
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,854
You're that guy
from the restaurant.

220
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,314
Seth.

221
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,161
What, are you, like,
following me or something?

222
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,515
What? No. Just...

223
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,817
Look, I'm not some psycho, OK?
You know me.

224
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:53,532
- We went to school together.
- What do you want?

225
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:57,033
I don't want anything.
I just want to talk to you.

226
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,117
When I saw you on the bus
the other day,

227
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:02,162
after all these years,
I... I felt something.

228
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:05,207
I know you did.
I can't just walk away from that.

229
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,671
- I don't even know you.
- Yeah, but you will.

230
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,667
You can go. I just...
Can I just talk to you?

231
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,256
- Hey, come on.
- Don't! Don't touch me. Move!

232
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,762
You kidding me?

233
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,304
Just let me
talk to you?

234
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,757
- Fuck you. Fuck you!
- Holly?

235
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:20,887
- Just let me explain.
- He tried to grab me.

236
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,564
What? No. Hey.
That is not true at all, man.

237
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,813
Fuck off!

238
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,768
- Did he hurt you?
- I'm fine.

239
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,403
You think this is funny?

240
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:39,068
- Eric, stop. Stop it.
- Laugh it up, dickhead.

241
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,869
Let me handle this. Come on!

242
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,542
Get the fuck away from her!

243
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:48,623
Don't you ever
come back here!

244
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:15,464
Maybe if you retrace your steps.

245
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,166
No. It's gotta be here somewhere.

246
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:21,088
Well, was your name in it?
Or, like, any contact information?

247
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,642
What do you think?

248
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:39,507
Ah!

249
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:45,143
You fucking bitch!

250
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,928
Claire? You here?

251
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,949
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

252
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:54,909
What I just put in you
is called pancuronium bromide.

253
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,290
It's a paralysing agent. Stings a little.

254
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:02,129
Don't worry. It's safe.
I tested it on myself.

255
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:42,915
- What you doing here?
- Oh.

256
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:44,837
Boss lady calls
in the middle of the night.

257
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,715
- Gotta make a delivery.
- Not so fast, man.

258
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,644
Sign in.

259
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,643
Right.

260
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:12,281
- Excuse me.
- The hell's that?

261
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:16,575
I think it's, uh, delousing powder.

262
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,995
Alright. See you later.

263
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:29,434
- You hear that?
- What?

264
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:38,312
- Something wrong?
- Shh.

265
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,518
- You hear something?
- Quiet, man.

266
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:50,572
You heard that, right?

267
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:53,821
That "Uh!" sound.

268
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:55,451
I don't hear anything.

269
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,237
What is it?

270
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:10,377
Fucking AC, man.

271
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:13,304
Shit's always going out.

272
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,799
Got it. Got it.

273
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:18,641
- It's, uh, broken?
- It's always broken.

274
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:21,637
- This whole place sucks.
- Alright.

275
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:44,229
Ugh! Ah!

276
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,659
Shut up!

277
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,165
So...

278
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:55,006
I'm Seth, in case you forgot.

279
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:57,932
Fuck you.

280
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:08,693
- Your choice.
- Fuck you!

281
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,562
I'm doing this
for your own good.

282
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,228
We'll try this again tomorrow.

283
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,782
Fuck you!

284
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,630
Hi.

285
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:08,061
I brought you some water.

286
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:15,853
Here. Drink this.

287
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:20,395
It's alright.

288
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:25,066
Alright. Breathe.
Breathe. Breathe. Sit up.

289
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:26,618
Sorry.

290
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,659
Take it easy. It's OK.

291
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:34,076
I brought food as well,
in case you feel up for it.

292
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,247
Water.

293
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,246
Food.

294
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:46,052
Just take it easy, alright?
That's all you're getting today.

295
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,597
Wait!
Please don't leave me.

296
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,055
I know this is hard.

297
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,188
It's hard for me too.

298
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,990
But it's important
to define our relationship.

299
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:08,949
Establish some boundaries.

300
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,541
This. This doesn't work.

301
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:16,254
That's right.

302
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:21,209
I'll come back tomorrow
and we'll get started.

303
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,271
He's gonna kill you.

304
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:24,271
But you know that.

305
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:29,065
Maybe he'll lose his nerve, huh?

306
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:30,777
Chicken out.

307
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:34,703
- Or maybe he'll just get bored.
- You're not helping.

308
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:37,038
He won't even need a gun, Holly.

309
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:39,874
All he has to do is walk away.

310
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,580
Shut up.

311
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:47,553
Look at you.
You're letting him beat you?

312
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:50,264
That pathetic little shit?

313
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:54,845
If that's all it takes,
then maybe you deserve to be in there.

314
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,563
Shut up!

315
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:15,087
Are you gonna rape me?

316
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,850
No.

317
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:21,022
Kill me?

318
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:23,772
I hope not.

319
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,767
You HOPE not?

320
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:33,398
Might not have a choice.

321
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:37,116
And why's that?

322
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:42,084
I might not be able to save you.

323
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:46,210
What is this, some kind of
fucking religious thing?

324
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:49,964
Did God tell you to punish
all the whores, something like that?

325
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:53,549
It's a different kind of saving.

326
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:55,625
- And no.
- So, what?

327
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,140
You're just a sick fuck?
This is how you get your kicks?

328
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:00,013
I'm not doing this for me.

329
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,720
Doing this for you.

330
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:05,391
Because you're special.

331
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,440
Special?

332
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:11,686
It's true.

333
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:14,028
Before I met you, I was just...

334
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:17,164
..floating through life...

335
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:20,278
..like any minute,
I could just drift off.

336
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,660
No-one would even notice.

337
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,289
Then you came along.

338
00:44:27,374 --> 00:44:30,174
And... the thing...

339
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:33,382
..the thing that made it so hard is...

340
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:35,916
..is I thought you were different.

341
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:40,602
You're smart. Funny.

342
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:46,393
When you talked to me, you saw me.
You really... saw me.

343
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:50,654
That's just what
you wanted me to see, huh?

344
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:56,067
The version of Holly you are
when everyone's watching.

345
00:44:56,236 --> 00:44:58,526
We both know that's a lie, don't we?

346
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:02,155
Go to hell.

347
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,541
That's the question.

348
00:45:04,703 --> 00:45:07,043
Which one's the real Holly?

349
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:08,915
The Holly on the outside or...

350
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:11,332
..the other Holly?

351
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:14,461
Because if there's even a chance
I can save you,

352
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,169
I have to take it.

353
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:22,096
But if that's it,
if there's nothing left to save,

354
00:45:22,262 --> 00:45:24,432
then you're never
leaving this room.

355
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:36,111
What you doing here?

356
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:38,696
Man, if they catch you
fucking around in them tunnels...

357
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:41,322
They won't catch me.
I'm not going in there.

358
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,369
Just grab a mop.

359
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,533
We got that place
smelling like dog shit out there.

360
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:47,158
Shit.

361
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,887
This fuckin' dude is a joke.

362
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:09,636
So...

363
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:12,897
What are you gonna do now?

364
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,726
I'm gonna wait.

365
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,067
Good girl.

366
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:43,132
It's a real page-turner.

367
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,136
You're a hell of a writer.
You know that?

368
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,228
You're a thief.

369
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:56,521
And now what?

370
00:46:57,565 --> 00:47:00,065
Suddenly, you've got me all figured out?

371
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:02,235
I wish. No.

372
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:06,028
Mostly, I just felt sorry for you.

373
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:08,985
You...

374
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,040
..felt sorry for me.

375
00:47:11,204 --> 00:47:13,674
Yeah, just the part
where you talk about love.

376
00:47:13,832 --> 00:47:19,252
"Love is just a label
for our biological imperatives."

377
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,260
I don't know. Felt ignorant to me.

378
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:25,133
Are you really gonna lecture me
on love, Seth?

379
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:27,551
You're keeping a girl in a cage.

380
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:31,676
I think I finally figured it out.

381
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:34,350
All these people
who talk about love

382
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:37,729
like it's this lightning bolt
from the sky,

383
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:40,477
this irresistible force.

384
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:44,030
So you think,
"Well, I've never felt that."

385
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:46,951
But those people are wrong.

386
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:49,075
Love's not a lightning bolt.

387
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:52,202
Love, real love,

388
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,080
takes work.

389
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,040
Sacrifice.

390
00:47:57,208 --> 00:48:01,128
Real love is giving everything you have
to someone else.

391
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:04,586
- That's love.
- Fucking kidding me.

392
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:06,627
You don't think?

393
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:08,601
"Love is sacrifice."

394
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:11,101
You know who believes that?

395
00:48:11,264 --> 00:48:13,184
People who hate themselves.

396
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:16,769
Who are alone, depressed.
Just like you.

397
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:19,106
- Think I hate myself?
- I know you do.

398
00:48:19,272 --> 00:48:21,272
You hate yourself so much,
you can't even imagine

399
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:23,861
how fucked up someone would
have to be to love you back.

400
00:48:24,027 --> 00:48:27,157
So you convince yourself
that love is this thing that you can buy!

401
00:48:27,322 --> 00:48:29,872
That all you have to do is keep giving.

402
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:33,083
Well, like I said,
I just feel sorry for you.

403
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:35,714
Spare me the fucking pity.
I'm not the one who's alone here.

404
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:38,042
No, I guess not.

405
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:49,386
And how is Claire these days?

406
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:55,136
What are you talking about?

407
00:48:55,308 --> 00:48:58,268
You know, sometimes
before I open that door...

408
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:01,016
..I can hear you talking in here.

409
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:02,899
To Claire.

410
00:49:03,066 --> 00:49:07,196
The way you do two voices
scared the hell out of me at first.

411
00:49:07,362 --> 00:49:09,862
You don't know
what you're talking about.

412
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:12,411
I know more than you think.

413
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:15,541
Is she here right now?

414
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:20,997
No.

415
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:23,127
She's not real.

416
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,634
You don't think I know that?

417
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:28,167
I think you're starting to forget.

418
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:30,011
Don't get paranoid on me, Eric.

419
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:32,886
You're no fun when you're paranoid.

420
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:35,814
You're sick, Holly.

421
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:39,144
Feeding that sickness
until all it does is eat.

422
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,400
You just have it all figured out,
don't you?

423
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,237
Almost.

424
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:50,993
One thing I still don't understand.

425
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:54,582
The journal.

426
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:58,792
First, I get it.
You and Eric are getting engaged.

427
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:00,915
Blah, blah, blah.

428
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:03,542
But here comes your best friend, Claire.
The real Claire.

429
00:50:05,962 --> 00:50:07,512
Holly can't eat.
Holly can't sleep.

430
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:09,752
Holly wants to confront them,
but Holly's too scared.

431
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:11,011
Fuck you!

432
00:50:14,262 --> 00:50:15,852
Then here.

433
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:19,269
Here's where it gets really interesting.

434
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:23,562
I get home and there's
20 messages from Dwayne, right?

435
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,230
He's like, "Where are you?
Why haven't you picked me up yet?"

436
00:50:26,399 --> 00:50:29,819
Even though he's the one who said
he was coming to get me on Saturday.

437
00:50:29,986 --> 00:50:32,406
You know, somehow, of course,
it's just magically my fault.

438
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:36,029
Were you gonna tell me?

439
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,540
Tell you what?

440
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:42,583
Come on, Claire.

441
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:45,879
- You know.
- Um, not really.

442
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:48,376
Eric.

443
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:54,295
How'd you find out?

444
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:56,309
His email. He doesn't know
I have the password.

445
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:58,767
- Shit.
- Yeah.

446
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:01,981
Holly. What do you want me to say?

447
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:05,693
You know, I'm sorry. We were so drunk.
It didn't mean anything.

448
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:08,265
Oh, well, as long as
it didn't mean anything.

449
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:09,861
OK. Holly,
please slow the car down.

450
00:51:10,026 --> 00:51:11,316
You're unbelievable.

451
00:51:13,446 --> 00:51:15,656
- Do you know that?
- I'm sorry.

452
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:18,203
You have no idea how shitty I feel
about this whole thing.

453
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:19,787
Holly, please
slow the car down. OK?

454
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:21,832
You're supposed to be
my best fucking friend.

455
00:51:21,996 --> 00:51:23,746
Holly, come on. Jesus!

456
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:29,128
Holly! Goddamnit!
You're gonna kill us!

457
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:35,468
Boom.

458
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:02,081
Oh, my God.

459
00:52:02,245 --> 00:52:05,155
Oh, my fucking God.

460
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:08,331
We're OK, alright?

461
00:52:10,128 --> 00:52:11,838
We're gonna be OK, Holly.

462
00:52:14,257 --> 00:52:17,177
We're... OK, Hol.

463
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:19,513
We're gonna be... be fine.

464
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:23,887
We're gonna be OK.

465
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,768
We're gonna be fine.

466
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:52,044
And you think that's what?

467
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:54,171
A confession?

468
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:57,508
I'm a writer, Seth.
Fiction's kind of what I do.

469
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:02,603
That's why I didn't go
straight to the police.

470
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:05,179
I had to be sure.

471
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:09,270
I thought I'd follow you around
for a few days,

472
00:53:09,437 --> 00:53:11,227
but you didn't make me
wait long.

473
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:19,855
It was a risky move, even for you.

474
00:53:36,047 --> 00:53:38,417
There were so many.

475
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:44,559
You want to know what I think?
I think you wanted to get caught.

476
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:48,232
That's why you kept the journal.

477
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:50,142
You wanted to get punished.

478
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:53,271
Lucky you came along.

479
00:53:55,942 --> 00:53:57,692
You don't get it, do you?

480
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:01,783
This isn't punishment.

481
00:54:01,948 --> 00:54:04,448
I'm trying to save you.

482
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:06,697
Then do it.

483
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,705
Save me.

484
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:15,092
I will.

485
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:20,337
I will.

486
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:23,893
I meant what I said.

487
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:28,426
I'm gonna stop you
hurting other people.

488
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,479
One way or the other.

489
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,170
And the Oscar goes to...

490
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:57,546
He wants to save me.

491
00:54:57,712 --> 00:55:01,012
I have to let him think
there's a chance.

492
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:03,633
So that was all an act?

493
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,850
You were just humouring him?

494
00:55:08,014 --> 00:55:09,474
Playing along?

495
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,520
If you've got
something to say...

496
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:16,190
I'm just making sure
your head's still in the game.

497
00:55:17,732 --> 00:55:20,612
I don't need another
useless pep talk, Claire.

498
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:23,356
And I don't need you.

499
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:50,388
Yes?

500
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:54,307
What? No. Nothing.

501
00:55:55,353 --> 00:55:58,403
Just... was curious.

502
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:00,324
Why you did it.

503
00:56:00,483 --> 00:56:04,573
I guess when I saw Eric's email,
all those messages from Claire...

504
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:07,277
No, not Claire. I understand that.

505
00:56:07,448 --> 00:56:10,028
It's a crime of passion or whatever.

506
00:56:10,201 --> 00:56:13,121
I want to know why you didn't stop there.

507
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:15,747
Why you killed the others.

508
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:17,995
'Cause you felt guilty,
for what you did to Claire,

509
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:19,587
for getting away with it.

510
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:21,252
You wanted to get caught,
didn't you?

511
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,170
No.

512
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:25,219
Because I could.

513
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:28,298
Yeah. I don't believe that.

514
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:30,759
Well, I don't care what you believe.

515
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:32,850
'Cause, see,
here's the thing, Seth.

516
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:35,385
When someone dies in front of you
the way Claire died,

517
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:39,189
it's like your whole world
just snaps into focus.

518
00:56:40,356 --> 00:56:42,896
- Cry for help?
- It was a way to pass the time.

519
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,937
Don't pretend
you know what I am.

520
00:56:45,111 --> 00:56:47,911
You're wrong. I do know you.
I know you from this.

521
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:51,242
And the girl who wrote this,
you had dreams.

522
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:52,949
She cared about people.

523
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:55,329
Was scared to be alone.

524
00:56:55,496 --> 00:56:58,576
This is the real you. Not...

525
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:08,129
Seth's got a little crush.

526
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:10,846
This isn't about us.

527
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:13,761
If you love something, set it free.

528
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,231
Isn't that how that goes?

529
00:57:17,977 --> 00:57:20,227
You know I can't do that.

530
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:24,187
Do you know what happens
to a great white shark

531
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:27,028
when you put him
inside an aquarium?

532
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:31,780
It bashes its brains against the glass.
Every time.

533
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:33,869
Come on.

534
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:36,204
Stop! Holly! Stop!

535
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:37,870
Stop! Holly!

536
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:41,753
What are you gonna do
when you come down here tomorrow

537
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:44,087
and I'm belly-up in the tank, huh?

538
00:57:45,254 --> 00:57:47,134
'Cause you can't just walk away.

539
00:57:47,298 --> 00:57:50,428
Not with your fingerprints
all over the place.

540
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:56,099
I kill myself, your life ends too.

541
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:05,771
So how's that for the boundaries
of our fucking relationship?

542
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:47,651
- Seth?
- Hm?

543
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:50,146
Finish this up
and come see me in my office.

544
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:58,327
Something wrong?

545
00:58:58,494 --> 00:59:01,164
"Is something wrong?"
That's the question, isn't it?

546
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,790
I'm not following you.

547
00:59:04,959 --> 00:59:09,049
The kennels are filthy.
There's the stock room. Where's Seth?

548
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:11,093
He's not here, that's for sure.

549
00:59:11,257 --> 00:59:13,297
Nate says you haven't been here
in two days.

550
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,967
Mrs Gundy, Nate is hardly...

551
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:18,176
Nate does his job.

552
00:59:18,347 --> 00:59:20,307
You should have done yours.

553
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:22,730
You're firing me?

554
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,603
Disciplinary notice.

555
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:27,146
This goes in
your permanent record.

556
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:28,833
One more strike and you're gone.
Understand?

557
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:30,227
Understood. Thank you.

558
00:59:30,401 --> 00:59:32,191
You don't know
how much this means to me.

559
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:40,739
This... this is
what's gonna happen to you

560
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,501
when you think
you're in control.

561
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:44,463
You think
you're in control, Holly.

562
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:49,253
Well, this is what'll happen
when you think you're in...

563
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:51,880
I control the situation.

564
00:59:58,429 --> 01:00:00,809
There's the man.
Just doing some maintenance.

565
01:00:00,973 --> 01:00:02,643
Didn't ask.

566
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:09,185
Hey, Seth,
I got your pay cheque.

567
01:00:24,163 --> 01:00:26,713
Still here, huh?

568
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:33,916
Where's the rest?

569
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:39,008
There is no rest.

570
01:00:39,178 --> 01:00:42,428
This is what happens when
you start acting like you're in control.

571
01:00:42,598 --> 01:00:44,928
- That's not enough.
- You don't get to decide that.

572
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,190
Fuck you!

573
01:00:47,353 --> 01:00:51,443
Fuck me? I go through hell for you
and you threaten me?

574
01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:53,727
You ever pull that shit again,
I'll show you

575
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:56,031
what a real hunger strike feels like.

576
01:00:56,195 --> 01:00:57,905
Fuck YOU.

577
01:01:05,037 --> 01:01:07,537
I had a dream last night.
You were in it.

578
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,423
It was just the two of us,

579
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:14,165
and we were in this house
down by the water.

580
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:16,378
And I think we'd been
living there a long time,

581
01:01:16,548 --> 01:01:19,258
'cause there were these
pictures on the walls, pictures of us.

582
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:23,809
It was weird looking at them, because...

583
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:26,772
..something about it felt right.

584
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:29,814
Like this, this whole world,
is the dream and...

585
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:33,358
..that house on the beach, that's reality.

586
01:01:34,483 --> 01:01:36,993
That's how things are supposed to be.

587
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:48,582
Maybe get you some snacks
from the vending machine.

588
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:51,503
Thanks, Seth.

589
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:21,132
Holy shit!

590
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,298
There's a light on the wall.

591
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:30,388
Hey. What's your name?

592
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:32,597
Um... I'm Nate.

593
01:03:32,768 --> 01:03:34,558
Listen to me, Nate.

594
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:36,808
You have to find something
to break open this lock.

595
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,610
Can you do that?

596
01:03:38,774 --> 01:03:41,114
What kind of fucked-up...

597
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:42,736
Did Seth do this?!

598
01:03:42,903 --> 01:03:44,823
Nate, there's no time
for that right now.

599
01:04:06,802 --> 01:04:09,352
- OK, go at it hard, at an angle.
- We gotta call somebody.

600
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:12,353
- The cops or whatever.
- Get me out of here right now.

601
01:04:28,824 --> 01:04:31,454
- Keep going.
- That's what I'm doing.

602
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:33,618
No, just... just...

603
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:37,367
- Harder!
- This is all fucked up.

604
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:42,050
- OK, that's great.
- OK, on three. Alright?

605
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:45,302
One, two, three!

606
01:04:48,677 --> 01:04:50,007
Fuck.

607
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:51,928
Hold on.

608
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:53,927
Do you know
what real love is, Nate?

609
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:56,689
- What?
- You know, real love.

610
01:04:56,852 --> 01:04:59,652
Say you loved somebody
but she got sick.

611
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:03,073
And then someone came along one day
to pull the plug on her,

612
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:05,033
to take her
away from you forever.

613
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:07,913
- What would you do?
- I don't know.

614
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:09,571
I just want to
get you outta here.

615
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,780
You would do anything
to stop that from happening.

616
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:13,660
Anything at all,
no matter what the cost,

617
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:17,157
because that's... what love is.

618
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:21,790
Love is sacrifice.

619
01:05:26,298 --> 01:05:28,628
What the fuck?

620
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,640
You gonna die!

621
01:05:32,179 --> 01:05:33,179
Oh!

622
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,103
Are you stabbing me?!

623
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:37,475
Arggh!

624
01:05:39,019 --> 01:05:41,099
Motherfucker!

625
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:48,357
The block, Seth.
Use the cinder block.

626
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:50,698
- He's moving. Come on. Use it.
- I can't.

627
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:54,164
You have to. Seth, I can't lose you.

628
01:05:54,326 --> 01:05:59,366
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

629
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:03,707
I can't feel my legs.

630
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:05,997
What the fuck?

631
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:12,296
Somebody help me!

632
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:14,599
Oh!

633
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:18,347
Oh, my...

634
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:22,599
Come on. Do it again.

635
01:06:30,696 --> 01:06:32,566
One more time.

636
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:39,709
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

637
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:42,541
Seth. You have to listen to me. OK?

638
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:44,998
You have to do exactly what I say.

639
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:47,048
Are you listening? OK.

640
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:50,472
Step one is disposing of the body.
The sooner, the better.

641
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:54,182
OK, burn it, bury it, sink it, whatever.
Get it out of here.

642
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:57,144
But you can't do that
before you get rid of any identifiers.

643
01:06:57,305 --> 01:06:59,925
Teeth, tattoos, fingerprints.

644
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,690
Fingerprints are easy.
You can use a carrot peeler for that.

645
01:07:02,853 --> 01:07:04,313
The teeth,
you need to scatter them.

646
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:06,229
Dumpsters, in water, whatever.

647
01:07:06,398 --> 01:07:09,188
Just not all in the same place.

648
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,239
And then there's just the body
to worry about.

649
01:07:14,156 --> 01:07:16,406
It's not gonna fit
in the incinerator.

650
01:07:16,575 --> 01:07:19,155
Well... not like that.

651
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:47,686
Here.

652
01:08:24,101 --> 01:08:26,231
Do you want to practise
what you're gonna say?

653
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:33,107
Hey. Mrs Gundy, it's Seth.

654
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:36,567
Sorry to call you so late. Um...

655
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:39,868
Yeah. Nate asked me to watch the front
while he ran some errands.

656
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:43,663
And he's still not back yet.
I don't know where he went.

657
01:08:43,829 --> 01:08:45,709
O...

658
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:47,292
OK. Goodnight.

659
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:48,787
Sorry.

660
01:09:37,007 --> 01:09:40,087
- How do you feel?
- I don't know.

661
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:43,220
Disconnected. Like it happened
to someone else, you know?

662
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:45,638
The first time's always the worst.

663
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:49,733
There is no first time.
It was an accident. I told you.

664
01:09:49,895 --> 01:09:52,305
You know what always got to me...

665
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,400
..was the questions.

666
01:09:54,566 --> 01:09:56,736
I remember in the beginning,
all I could think about

667
01:09:56,902 --> 01:09:58,902
was what if she had a pet?

668
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:03,330
This poor little doggie just...
sitting by the door

669
01:10:03,491 --> 01:10:05,741
waiting for her to come home.

670
01:10:05,911 --> 01:10:08,251
But all that goes away.

671
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:10,043
The more you think about it,

672
01:10:10,207 --> 01:10:12,457
the more you remember
the parts that you liked.

673
01:10:12,626 --> 01:10:14,376
How it made you feel.

674
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:16,884
Like you were in control of your life
for the first time,

675
01:10:17,047 --> 01:10:18,417
like nothing could hurt you.

676
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:19,970
That's not how it was.

677
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:22,263
But the only problem is...

678
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:25,677
..that sooner or later,
it all goes back to normal.

679
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:31,233
All of a sudden, you're nothing special.
You're just you.

680
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,064
Stop, OK?

681
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,230
And that's when
you start to wonder

682
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:38,398
how far you'd have to go
to get that feeling back.

683
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:40,648
It's not the same.

684
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:44,620
There is no shame
in accepting what you are, Seth.

685
01:10:44,783 --> 01:10:47,043
I did it to keep us safe.
I had no choice.

686
01:10:47,202 --> 01:10:49,042
Didn't you ever wonder why...

687
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:53,380
..all the girls in the world,
but you get a hard-on for me?

688
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:56,921
And you think that's, what,
a coincidence?

689
01:10:57,087 --> 01:10:59,917
You and me, we were born to do this.

690
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:03,430
Don't act like you know
a goddamn thing about me.

691
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:06,473
I know that a normal person
finds a murder confession

692
01:11:06,638 --> 01:11:08,928
and goes to the police,
not to PetSmart.

693
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:12,809
Oh, yeah - "Excuse me, Officer.
See that girl over there, the waitress?

694
01:11:12,978 --> 01:11:14,768
"She's Hannibal Lecter.
You know how I know?

695
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:16,818
"I broke into her apartment
and stole her shit."

696
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:19,146
Oh, and so plan B is kidnapping?

697
01:11:19,317 --> 01:11:20,777
Because the fucking alternative

698
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:23,364
was sitting around
watching you hurt someone else.

699
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:24,910
Mmm.

700
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:28,329
Good thing no-one got hurt.

701
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:30,203
I told you.

702
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:33,960
I told you. It was an accident.

703
01:11:34,124 --> 01:11:35,964
Face it, Seth.

704
01:11:36,126 --> 01:11:40,296
This was never about saving lives.
You like this.

705
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:42,883
You like having that kind of power.

706
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:46,219
- Deciding who lives, who dies.
- Holly.

707
01:11:46,386 --> 01:11:48,216
It's not too late.

708
01:11:48,388 --> 01:11:50,058
I can save you.

709
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:51,773
Please.

710
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:55,943
Please. I can save you.

711
01:12:00,108 --> 01:12:02,398
Maybe you're not supposed to save me.

712
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:07,820
Maybe I'm supposed to save you.

713
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:14,083
Don't. Don't.

714
01:12:31,723 --> 01:12:35,563
Seth. Please help me. I'm so cold.
Please make me warm.

715
01:12:35,727 --> 01:12:38,227
Can you help me?
Can you please make me warm?

716
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:47,567
I thought you loved me.

717
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,027
I do.

718
01:12:53,912 --> 01:12:55,542
I do love you.

719
01:12:56,623 --> 01:12:58,173
Holly.

720
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:00,249
Holly!

721
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:06,671
Holly.

722
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:14,810
Come back as soon as I can.

723
01:13:27,112 --> 01:13:30,032
- Oh.
- Seth.

724
01:13:30,198 --> 01:13:32,078
This is Detective Meara.

725
01:13:32,242 --> 01:13:33,992
Something wrong?

726
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,080
Is there
somewhere we can talk?

727
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:39,623
So you work with Nathan, yeah?

728
01:13:39,791 --> 01:13:41,631
Yes.

729
01:13:41,793 --> 01:13:43,803
When's the last time
you saw him?

730
01:13:43,962 --> 01:13:46,422
Wednesday, I think.
Wednesday evening.

731
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:49,929
Yeah, he asked me to cover the front
while he ran some errands.

732
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:52,433
- What kind of errands?
- Um, he... he didn't say.

733
01:13:53,471 --> 01:13:56,851
Uh-huh. And this would be
about... what time?

734
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:00,444
9:00, 10:00. Something like that.

735
01:14:01,688 --> 01:14:04,228
- He leave out through the front?
- Yeah.

736
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:06,649
The front door? You sure?

737
01:14:06,818 --> 01:14:08,238
Yeah. Why?

738
01:14:08,403 --> 01:14:10,323
Well, here's the thing. Um...

739
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:13,618
The front door operates
on a keyless entry system.

740
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:18,003
As you know,
it records each instance in or out.

741
01:14:18,163 --> 01:14:21,083
Now, you want to guess the last time
someone opened that door?

742
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:25,880
- Four. That's 4am.
- Oh.

743
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:28,085
And you said it was,
what, 9pm or 10pm?

744
01:14:28,256 --> 01:14:29,736
That's kind of weird,
don't you think?

745
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,469
Maybe I'm
remembering it wrong.

746
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:34,354
He could have left out the side door,
loading docks.

747
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:36,762
Loading docks?

748
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:40,481
Oh, shit. Yeah. I should check that out.

749
01:14:42,604 --> 01:14:44,024
You and Nathan friends?

750
01:14:44,189 --> 01:14:46,939
Well, we worked together.
He was a nice guy and all.

751
01:14:47,108 --> 01:14:48,818
- Till he tried to get you fired.
- What?

752
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:51,905
Oh. That is not what happened.
Nate and I were friends.

753
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:56,411
Oh, now you're friends again.
Or you were friends, past tense?

754
01:14:56,576 --> 01:14:58,326
That's the second time
you said that.

755
01:14:58,495 --> 01:15:00,075
Well, you know what they say.

756
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:02,666
First time's confusion,
the second time's a confession.

757
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:06,038
- What's this about?
- Standard procedure.

758
01:15:06,211 --> 01:15:08,921
So, now, he asked you
to cover for him,

759
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:11,378
this is, what, Wednesday night,
9:00 or 10:00?

760
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:14,049
- Say where he was going?
- Think he had to meet someone.

761
01:15:14,219 --> 01:15:16,349
He got a phone call, something.

762
01:15:16,513 --> 01:15:18,933
It's funny, because
the first thing we did...

763
01:15:20,058 --> 01:15:21,638
..was check the phone records.

764
01:15:21,809 --> 01:15:24,479
And the last person he talked to
was his girlfriend.

765
01:15:25,522 --> 01:15:27,652
5:32 that afternoon.

766
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:29,634
Hi.

767
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:37,218
Gotta eat something.

768
01:16:42,432 --> 01:16:45,232
Holly. Come on.

769
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:50,019
Come on.

770
01:16:51,065 --> 01:16:52,855
Come on. Don't do this.

771
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:22,219
Now, I know what you're doing.

772
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:25,216
It's not gonna work.

773
01:17:28,186 --> 01:17:29,846
Just talk to me.

774
01:17:30,021 --> 01:17:31,651
Please.

775
01:17:37,779 --> 01:17:39,659
It's over, Seth.

776
01:17:41,866 --> 01:17:44,156
I don't understand.

777
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:48,411
Because if you can't help me,

778
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:52,341
if you can't give me what I need,
then no-one can.

779
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:57,628
Tell me. Tell me what you need.

780
01:18:00,093 --> 01:18:01,893
You know the answer.

781
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:04,850
You put me in a box.

782
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:09,229
That's not love. That's ownership.

783
01:18:13,106 --> 01:18:16,066
You didn't give me anything.

784
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:20,987
All you did was take.

785
01:18:21,155 --> 01:18:23,655
I can't let you out.

786
01:18:23,825 --> 01:18:27,325
- You know that.
- Didn't ask you to.

787
01:18:27,495 --> 01:18:30,075
Then what? What do you want?

788
01:18:35,712 --> 01:18:37,342
Proof.

789
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:41,512
Proof?

790
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:44,637
A finger.

791
01:18:44,804 --> 01:18:46,144
A what? A f...

792
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:47,805
A finger?

793
01:18:50,101 --> 01:18:52,651
My finger?

794
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:02,405
No. No. No.

795
01:19:02,572 --> 01:19:04,912
No. No.

796
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:06,584
This is fucked.

797
01:19:06,743 --> 01:19:08,793
Can't you see that?

798
01:19:08,953 --> 01:19:11,003
This is totally fucked.

799
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:15,668
No. I'm trying to save you here.

800
01:19:15,835 --> 01:19:17,745
And I'm trying to let you.

801
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,010
Well, you can't
ask me for that, Holly.

802
01:19:20,173 --> 01:19:22,133
And I'm not gonna do it.

803
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:28,260
I used to think
I was the only one.

804
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:32,886
Even when I was a kid,
I still knew...

805
01:19:34,187 --> 01:19:37,817
..that if they ever found out,
my family, my friends...

806
01:19:39,567 --> 01:19:42,857
..if they knew what I really was,
they'd run the other way.

807
01:19:47,033 --> 01:19:49,163
And so you learn to...

808
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:54,254
..blend in, to fake it.

809
01:19:57,668 --> 01:19:59,208
After a while, you...

810
01:20:00,755 --> 01:20:04,045
..you don't even notice
how lonely you really are.

811
01:20:10,097 --> 01:20:11,637
But then...

812
01:20:14,769 --> 01:20:16,729
..someone comes along,

813
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,516
someone like you.

814
01:20:22,026 --> 01:20:25,066
Even if he just doesn't know it yet.

815
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:31,290
And all of a sudden, you start thinking...

816
01:20:33,246 --> 01:20:35,826
..maybe it doesn't have to be this way.

817
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:40,455
Maybe I don't have to be alone.

818
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:43,967
And so you let go of the rope.

819
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:50,296
Because this person,
he's not gonna let you fall.

820
01:20:50,471 --> 01:20:52,681
He's gonna catch you. You know it.

821
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:00,942
At least, that's what
you keep telling yourself.

822
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:05,315
The whole way down.

823
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:26,166
Don't come back.

824
01:21:28,175 --> 01:21:31,295
If that's all I am to you,
if I'm just a pet...

825
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:35,604
..then don't come back for me.

826
01:21:36,851 --> 01:21:38,521
Don't come back for me.

827
01:24:11,756 --> 01:24:14,966
If I do this for you,

828
01:24:15,134 --> 01:24:17,554
then you'll believe?

829
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,680
Yes.

830
01:24:33,527 --> 01:24:35,277
This is wrong.

831
01:24:35,446 --> 01:24:37,276
Seth, you love me.

832
01:24:37,448 --> 01:24:39,908
There's nothing more right than that.

833
01:24:53,464 --> 01:24:54,804
Arggh!

834
01:24:54,965 --> 01:24:56,835
You're almost there.

835
01:25:08,521 --> 01:25:10,521
Open the door.

836
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:14,282
- What are you doing?
- Open the fucking door!

837
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:16,323
You're already
down a finger, Seth.

838
01:25:16,487 --> 01:25:18,067
How much more
are you ready to lose?

839
01:25:34,797 --> 01:25:36,417
Get back!

840
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:05,543
Holly.

841
01:26:07,163 --> 01:26:10,213
Holly. Wait. What are you doing?

842
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:13,214
Shh.

843
01:26:22,011 --> 01:26:23,601
I believe you.

844
01:26:27,016 --> 01:26:30,226
You do?

845
01:26:34,148 --> 01:26:35,688
Do you?

846
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,240
You saved me, Seth.

847
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:47,494
Of course I love you.

848
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:05,054
But you know what that means.

849
01:27:15,481 --> 01:27:16,861
Holly.

850
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:19,743
Don't leave me.

851
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:40,091
Oh, God! Oh!

852
01:28:01,777 --> 01:28:03,987
You've been
working on these pieces for years.

853
01:28:04,154 --> 01:28:06,204
I know.
I'm not saying I'm not excited.

854
01:28:06,365 --> 01:28:08,235
It's, like, great
to get that call. I just...

855
01:28:08,409 --> 01:28:10,119
Figured you'd be
more psyched about this.

856
01:28:10,286 --> 01:28:12,326
It's a big deal, getting published.

857
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:15,116
It's just a vanity press.
It's not exactly the 'New Yorker'.

858
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:17,251
Screw that. It's still awesome.

859
01:28:17,418 --> 01:28:18,788
I'm proud of you.

860
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:20,551
I thought you didn't even
like my story.

861
01:28:20,713 --> 01:28:22,553
I like you.

862
01:28:25,676 --> 01:28:28,756
- Babe, can you grab my phone?
- Yeah.

863
01:28:28,929 --> 01:28:31,809
..<i>Panthers as they're
making their way across the field.</i>

864
01:28:31,974 --> 01:28:34,604
<i>A good start
to their first possession tonight.</i>

865
01:28:34,768 --> 01:28:36,848
<i>You ain't kidding.</i>

866
01:28:37,021 --> 01:28:39,021
<i>Number 40...</i>

867
01:28:40,065 --> 01:28:41,815
<i>Chavez takes the snap,</i>

868
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:46,664
<i>fakes the hands-off, right there in front
of him, one man to beat, can't beat him.</i>

869
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:50,622
<i>It's taken down at the 4-yard line.</i>

870
01:28:51,744 --> 01:28:54,334
<i>But it looks like it's enough
for a first down.</i>

871
01:28:54,496 --> 01:28:56,706
<i>And Chapman
keeps this possession going.</i>

872
01:28:56,874 --> 01:29:00,134
<i>Really short drive after the fumble. And...</i>

873
01:29:00,294 --> 01:29:02,884
<i>Just a great play.
Unable to get around that defender.</i>

874
01:29:03,047 --> 01:29:05,297
<i>Colin Spencer, once again,
involved in that tackle.</i>

875
01:29:09,553 --> 01:29:12,223
- Here you go.
- Thank you, babe.

876
01:29:51,762 --> 01:29:53,312
Hi.

877
01:29:57,393 --> 01:30:00,693
I had another bad day
with Eric.

878
01:30:00,854 --> 01:30:03,274
He's still fooling around with other girls.

879
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:07,190
This morning, I almost... hurt him.

880
01:30:09,488 --> 01:30:11,368
But then I thought of you.

881
01:30:18,956 --> 01:30:21,206
And how much you love me.

882
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:26,336
And what you're doing for me.

883
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:31,640
Then I felt better.

883
01:30:32,305 --> 01:31:32,609
