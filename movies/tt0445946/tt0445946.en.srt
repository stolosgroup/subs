2
00:01:21,146 --> 00:01:22,613
It's on.

3
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,775
You the new guy, Davis?

4
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:39,041
No, no, no way.

5
00:03:39,217 --> 00:03:41,481
I'm the guy
here to ice the floor for skating.

6
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:43,884
Hope you're better
than the last guy.

7
00:03:44,055 --> 00:03:45,079
DAVIS:
What's wrong with him?

8
00:03:45,924 --> 00:03:47,357
Couldn't take the heat.

9
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:50,619
Yeah, well, I'm fireproof.

10
00:03:53,331 --> 00:03:54,389
Short on self-discipline?

11
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,438
Bobby Fischer would be
proud of that move.

12
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:03,699
You got no way out now, pal.

13
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,776
So where's the big tamale?
Coming.

14
00:04:07,845 --> 00:04:09,005
Just relax.

15
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:15,244
That's a quick way to go deaf.

16
00:04:16,187 --> 00:04:17,176
What'd you say?

17
00:04:17,355 --> 00:04:18,845
That's a quick way to go deaf.

18
00:04:26,864 --> 00:04:29,424
You winning?
I never lose.

19
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:31,766
All right, let's get on with it.

20
00:04:35,406 --> 00:04:39,570
It's a two-step contract.
Everything you need to know is there.

21
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:41,735
Memorize it.
By tomorrow morning.

22
00:04:41,913 --> 00:04:45,007
After that, it'll corrupt
and nuke your hard drive.

23
00:04:45,483 --> 00:04:46,609
Great.

24
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:50,813
You're Davis.

25
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:53,753
I didn't think you knew I was here.
I knew.

26
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:55,119
Something wrong?

27
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:57,090
I don't see-

28
00:04:57,929 --> 00:04:59,123
There's no exit strategy.

29
00:04:59,297 --> 00:05:01,561
The operation has
been planned in detail.

30
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:02,961
I'm glad
you're confident.

31
00:05:03,134 --> 00:05:05,728
But if we need to abort
or if we miss the target-

32
00:05:05,903 --> 00:05:08,167
We're not gonna miss.

33
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:10,239
You intending to miss?

34
00:05:10,408 --> 00:05:13,741
Not me.
I can't vouch for anyone else.

35
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:15,276
I can.

36
00:05:17,315 --> 00:05:21,115
We travel on separate airlines.
IDs and tickets from Turner.

37
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:23,310
DAVIS: First class?
Coach.

38
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:25,080
I bet you're going first.

39
00:05:25,256 --> 00:05:27,622
Yeah, but I'm the big tamale.
Remember?

40
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:29,754
All right, that's all.

41
00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:34,931
Oh, hell, I can't believe it.

42
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:39,197
Problem?
He got me. Checkmate.

43
00:05:58,056 --> 00:05:59,387
Good play!

44
00:06:10,735 --> 00:06:13,533
Come on, Matty,
keep your head down.

45
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:17,139
Attaboy, Matty.

46
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:23,477
Turn two.

47
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:03,954
Hey, come on,
sit down.

48
00:07:14,065 --> 00:07:16,192
What do you have to say
for yourself?

49
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:18,995
Nothing, Dad.
What do you want me to say?

50
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,468
To start with? Apology.

51
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,473
An apology to who?
Your teammates, to me.

52
00:07:26,477 --> 00:07:28,308
Lucky you got off
with a three-day suspension.

53
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,379
Lucky?
Yes, you're lucky.

54
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:33,016
Dad, it's not a big deal.
Everybody smokes pot these days.

55
00:07:33,184 --> 00:07:35,652
Oh, don't give me that bullshit,
Chris. Do I look like a chump?

56
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,118
You know I don't care what
other kids do. You're my son.

57
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:45,155
I know what this is about.

58
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,925
It's about your mother.

59
00:07:48,432 --> 00:07:50,161
Whatever.

60
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:53,303
Chris, let me just-
Okay,

61
00:07:53,471 --> 00:07:56,804
let's just get it over with right
now! Tell me everything I do wrong.

62
00:07:56,974 --> 00:07:58,168
Knock yourself out,
okay?

63
00:07:58,342 --> 00:08:00,708
I'm trying to tell you I understa-
Stop trying to help me!

64
00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:03,472
Stop wearing that stupid pink wristband
like it's gonna make any difference.

65
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:06,515
You can't do anything
about anything.

66
00:08:07,418 --> 00:08:09,943
Why do you keep
pretending like you can? You can't.

67
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:14,182
It wasn't all right, Dad.

68
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:18,217
You said when she was sick
it was gonna be all right...

69
00:08:21,632 --> 00:08:23,099
...and it wasn't.

70
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:48,554
Lydel Hammond?
Take a look at this.

71
00:08:50,027 --> 00:08:52,894
I got better pictures than these,
Mr. Hammond. Know what I mean?

72
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:55,862
My wife hired you.
Of course she did.

73
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:59,298
Do you know who my father is?
That's why we're talking to you.

74
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,165
Thought maybe
you could make a better deal.

75
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:03,569
What's it gonna cost me?
Well...

76
00:09:14,185 --> 00:09:17,814
You're gonna be late for school.
No, I'm playing hooky.

77
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:20,355
You're playing hooky?
Yep.

78
00:09:20,858 --> 00:09:23,383
Hey, listen I thought, you and
I, we could do something together,

79
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:25,426
you know?
Something you like doing.

80
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:30,022
Well, the cop took all my reefers,
Dad.

81
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:31,327
Well, besides that,
you know?

82
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:36,704
What about camping?

83
00:09:36,874 --> 00:09:39,399
You like camping?
That's not the point, you like it.

84
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:41,943
You loved that Outward Bound
thing you did.

85
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:44,339
What do you say?

86
00:09:45,082 --> 00:09:46,447
I don't think you're serious.

87
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,884
So what do you do for a living, Mr...

88
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:57,789
...Ellwood?
I sell computer equipment.

89
00:09:57,962 --> 00:09:59,293
Peripherals, we call it.

90
00:09:59,463 --> 00:10:01,863
Not computers,
but the stuff that goes with it.

91
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:04,001
You know, cables, software,

92
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:06,796
mini storage systems,
things like that.

93
00:10:06,971 --> 00:10:09,906
I'm afraid it's not very interesting.
Oh, no.

94
00:10:10,074 --> 00:10:12,668
It's fascinating.

95
00:10:12,843 --> 00:10:15,937
Right. There we are, Mr. Ellwood.

96
00:10:16,113 --> 00:10:18,673
Utilities included, rent due
on the first of the month.

97
00:10:18,849 --> 00:10:21,249
Very good, thank you.
You get use of the garage.

98
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:23,944
There's an electric opener
on the shelf in the kitchen.

99
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:26,589
Trash service
Mondays and Thursdays.

100
00:10:26,757 --> 00:10:28,657
Good luck.
Thank you very much.

101
00:10:33,864 --> 00:10:35,491
Act one is complete.

102
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,224
No problems?
That's correct.

103
00:10:37,401 --> 00:10:40,029
Good.
Curtain going up on act two.

104
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,310
I wasn't talking to her at all.

105
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:50,276
She wanted to give me her number.

106
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:53,076
I said, "Sorry, honey.
I already got a girlfriend.

107
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,810
Great girl.
That's her, just over there. "

108
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,838
Whoa, did you see that?

109
00:11:30,788 --> 00:11:32,688
Stay back, man.

110
00:11:34,191 --> 00:11:36,489
Auto accident.
No kidding.

111
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,185
You got any more?
No, other guy's a pile of ash.

112
00:11:39,363 --> 00:11:42,799
Vitals are stable on this one.
Did he say anything on the way in?

113
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:44,628
No, he was out of it
when I got to him.

114
00:11:44,802 --> 00:11:46,133
Okay.

115
00:11:49,273 --> 00:11:50,706
Doctor?

116
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:53,043
Call security.

117
00:12:04,455 --> 00:12:05,888
How you feeling?

118
00:12:06,056 --> 00:12:07,421
My name's Wainwright.

119
00:12:07,591 --> 00:12:10,253
Ed Wainwright. Chief of Police.

120
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:15,491
Come on, guy drove straight at me.
Oh, sure, yeah. It's not that.

121
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:17,894
Your gun?

122
00:12:21,238 --> 00:12:22,967
We did a little checking.

123
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,268
Tried to get in touch
with Robert Ellwood's next of kin.

124
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:28,002
Turns out he didn't have any.

125
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:30,511
And he died when he was three.

126
00:12:30,915 --> 00:12:33,907
Ran a set of your prints,
Mr. Carden.

127
00:12:34,118 --> 00:12:38,612
Apparently, you've been
missing in action for many years.

128
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:42,115
But you're not missing anymore,
Mr. Carden.

129
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,794
Not too often we get somebody
your caliber up here in our little burg.

130
00:12:46,964 --> 00:12:50,161
You know, frankly, Frank,
I can't think of anybody-

131
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:52,632
Hey, frankly, Frank.

132
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:54,395
Is that- Is that a pun?

133
00:12:54,972 --> 00:12:58,305
It's an alliteration, chief, not a pun.
Yeah, well, anyway.

134
00:12:58,476 --> 00:13:00,034
So come on, Frank,

135
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:03,476
what are you doing around here?
When are they coming for me?

136
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:16,154
I'm gonna have two men here all night.

137
00:13:17,027 --> 00:13:19,427
Just for you, Mr. Carden.

138
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:26,326
Keep your eyes open.
I'll be back in the morning.

139
00:13:26,504 --> 00:13:28,062
Sure, chief.

140
00:13:58,335 --> 00:14:01,532
What in the hell is it can't
wait for an hour and a half?

141
00:14:01,705 --> 00:14:05,903
Cops in the Northwest picked up
this guy in some kind of accident.

142
00:14:06,076 --> 00:14:07,634
Better be good.

143
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:09,403
Well, I ran his prints
through a database.

144
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,447
Got a match
with a Major Frank Carden

145
00:14:12,616 --> 00:14:13,810
from his military records.

146
00:14:13,984 --> 00:14:15,849
Frank Carden?
You know him?

147
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,609
No.

148
00:14:17,788 --> 00:14:20,780
He was Defense of Intelligence,
MIA in 1974.

149
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,189
Take it he didn't die in the accident?
No, he's in the hospital.

150
00:14:24,361 --> 00:14:26,352
Somebody hit
the Homeland Security button.

151
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,327
The FBl has gotten all excited.

152
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:30,831
The other agencies are lining up
behind us.

153
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:32,969
This guy is a hot potato.

154
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:35,027
Is he?

155
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:38,502
Just about everyone seems
to ring alarm bells these days.

156
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:40,974
All right. Let me know
when he gets here.

157
00:14:41,145 --> 00:14:42,476
Sure.

158
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,843
See you later.

159
00:14:50,354 --> 00:14:51,651
Yes.
Miles.

160
00:14:51,822 --> 00:14:53,153
What have you got? Is it him?

161
00:14:53,324 --> 00:14:54,621
Yes. It's definitely Carden.

162
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:57,192
FBl liaison officer
just came by to tell me.

163
00:14:57,361 --> 00:14:59,921
I don't want this going any further.
No, sir.

164
00:15:00,097 --> 00:15:02,588
It won't get out of hand.
I'm on top of it.

165
00:15:19,116 --> 00:15:20,105
DAVIS:
How do you know that?

166
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:21,615
He called me.
DAVIS: He called you?

167
00:15:21,785 --> 00:15:23,719
How did he manage that?
Ask him later.

168
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:26,151
We're gonna have to improvise.
Okay, rule one.

169
00:15:26,323 --> 00:15:27,483
We don't go back
for him.

170
00:15:27,658 --> 00:15:29,626
We leave him down.
That's not rule one.

171
00:15:29,793 --> 00:15:32,125
Same for any of us.
What are you talking about?

172
00:15:32,296 --> 00:15:34,059
The old man got caught,
that's his problem.

173
00:15:34,231 --> 00:15:37,098
This is Frank's command. We've
been with him a long time.

174
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:39,360
Yeah, everybody but you.
Ever hear of loyalty?

175
00:15:39,536 --> 00:15:41,436
Yeah, I read about it
in a book once. Look,

176
00:15:41,605 --> 00:15:43,368
I'm not getting paid
to save his ass.

177
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,304
You're not getting paid
unless we save his ass.

178
00:15:46,477 --> 00:15:47,967
You know that offshore account?

179
00:15:48,145 --> 00:15:49,703
Only Frank can access it.

180
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,211
No Frank,

181
00:15:51,382 --> 00:15:53,009
no money.

182
00:15:54,918 --> 00:15:58,615
Now, you see, that argument
appeals to my sentimental side.

183
00:15:58,789 --> 00:16:01,952
Local celebrities and officials
are reported to be lobbying for seats

184
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:04,424
at a dinner for the president,
to be held following

185
00:16:04,595 --> 00:16:06,995
his upcoming speech
at Woodburn College.

186
00:16:07,164 --> 00:16:08,153
Morning.

187
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:09,924
Morning.
Death has been reported

188
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,069
of a well-known local personality,
Lydel Hammond, Jr.,

189
00:16:13,237 --> 00:16:15,501
in what appears to be
a hit-and-run accident

190
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:17,231
outside the Rosemont Apartments.

191
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:20,275
Reporter Melanie Stewart...
We're really doing this, aren't we?

192
00:16:20,444 --> 00:16:23,880
No, I figured we'd just wake up,
make breakfast and go back to bed.

193
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:27,484
MELANIE Lydel Hammond, Jr. is the
son of the reclusive billionaire.

194
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:30,882
Hammond Sr. is expected to make
a rare public appearance

195
00:16:31,055 --> 00:16:33,649
at the funeral of his son
in a few days.

196
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:36,759
That's the same Hammond
as the street, right?

197
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:38,861
Yeah.
And the stadium.

198
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:40,724
Yep.
- Hammond Sr., a contributor

199
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:42,331
to the current administration,

200
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:45,900
has caused an embarrassment
recently, by his alleged support

201
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,938
of direct action, violence,
against doctors and scientists

202
00:16:50,107 --> 00:16:52,598
involved in stem-cell research.

203
00:16:59,616 --> 00:17:02,449
Sorry about the cuffs, Frank.
Rules, you know?

204
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:04,246
Yeah, sure.

205
00:17:04,421 --> 00:17:06,480
Can't be too careful, can we?

206
00:17:07,091 --> 00:17:09,559
STANFIELD: So what are you
doing around here, Frank?

207
00:17:11,161 --> 00:17:13,391
Nice part of the country.

208
00:17:13,564 --> 00:17:15,156
I like the scenery.

209
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:18,359
Well, take a good, long look.

210
00:17:18,535 --> 00:17:20,059
Might be your last chance.

211
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:27,169
CHRIS:
So the team lost, huh?

212
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:29,705
Yeah.

213
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,404
Again.

214
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:34,041
Again.

215
00:17:35,552 --> 00:17:40,216
You know, we showed up. We tried.
That's what important, isn't it, Chris?

216
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,086
You ever wonder
about your coaching ability?

217
00:17:44,728 --> 00:17:47,458
No, that's not
what I'm wondering about.

218
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:05,739
So you ready?

219
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,009
Yep.
Okay.

220
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:13,486
Sure we don't need
that map?

221
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:18,185
I told you I know this area, okay?
All right, all right, all right.

222
00:18:35,345 --> 00:18:37,472
CHRIS: Yeah, but it's just
the same as your alcohol,

223
00:18:37,648 --> 00:18:39,707
and your beer-
Good point, but so what?

224
00:18:39,883 --> 00:18:42,647
I don't want you drinking, either.
It's legal in some countries.

225
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,651
It's not legal here.
It could be.

226
00:18:44,822 --> 00:18:47,382
That's true, but it isn't.
So you've never tried it?

227
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:50,391
I didn't say that. I tried it. I
didn't like it. Didn't like the crowd.

228
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:53,962
They were a bunch of losers. Pot
makes you stupid, lowers your IQ.

229
00:18:54,131 --> 00:18:55,860
So you smoked it
more than I did, huh?

230
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:57,557
Very funny.

231
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:02,501
MICHAELS:
Yeah, I don't like it.

232
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:04,573
RODRIGUES: What exactly
don't you like about it?

233
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:07,141
I don't like to read
while I'm watching a movie.

234
00:19:07,311 --> 00:19:08,642
You get used to it.

235
00:19:08,812 --> 00:19:11,212
It's all right for you.
You speak Spanish.

236
00:19:11,381 --> 00:19:14,441
Not that well.
I still have to read the subtitles.

237
00:19:14,818 --> 00:19:18,379
Face it. You just don't wanna watch
a foreign film, that's all.

238
00:19:18,555 --> 00:19:20,853
Yeah,
I just wanna watch.

239
00:19:21,024 --> 00:19:23,857
If I wanna read,
I buy a book.

240
00:19:34,738 --> 00:19:36,638
Christ. Give him a hand, will you?

241
00:19:43,547 --> 00:19:45,139
Hey, you're blocking
the whole road.

242
00:19:50,053 --> 00:19:51,486
Go!

243
00:20:14,645 --> 00:20:15,634
You-!

244
00:20:31,862 --> 00:20:34,092
You sure there's no
alternative pay arrangements?

245
00:20:34,264 --> 00:20:37,825
You and Davis get down
there. Royko, get rid of that.

246
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:21,468
RAy: I thought these old
bridges were supposed to be built

247
00:21:21,645 --> 00:21:25,081
over gorges and canyons
and things, you know?

248
00:21:25,248 --> 00:21:27,375
CHRIS: You've been watching
too many old movies on TV.

249
00:21:27,551 --> 00:21:29,781
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You remember that one, Gunga Din?

250
00:21:29,953 --> 00:21:32,547
Where they had the elephant
and it was crossing that-

251
00:21:32,723 --> 00:21:35,487
Chris.
What?

252
00:21:39,763 --> 00:21:41,230
Come on.

253
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,277
All right. Give me your hand.

254
00:22:02,452 --> 00:22:03,885
I got you.

255
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:10,755
I got you. Come on.

256
00:22:14,765 --> 00:22:16,289
Okay.

257
00:22:19,603 --> 00:22:21,298
I'm a U.S. Marshal.

258
00:22:21,471 --> 00:22:22,699
My prisoner.

259
00:22:22,873 --> 00:22:26,001
My prisoner. Keys.

260
00:22:29,012 --> 00:22:30,343
Take custody.

261
00:22:30,514 --> 00:22:33,210
My gun. Gun.

262
00:22:39,022 --> 00:22:40,717
Call 911.

263
00:22:40,891 --> 00:22:42,518
Don't let him go.

264
00:22:42,692 --> 00:22:44,523
Don't let him go.

265
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:50,559
Mister?

266
00:22:56,006 --> 00:22:57,906
DAVIS:
It's a big waste of time.

267
00:22:58,075 --> 00:23:00,976
Carden's got nine lives,
didn't you know?

268
00:23:01,311 --> 00:23:02,972
You wanna point that thing
somewhere else?

269
00:23:08,185 --> 00:23:09,516
Chris.

270
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:12,115
Chris!

271
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:15,656
Get your phone out of your
backpack. Call 911 right now.

272
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:19,688
Just stay-
Just stay there, mister.

273
00:23:19,863 --> 00:23:22,331
Hang back. Hang back.
All right.

274
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:25,991
There's no service.

275
00:23:27,404 --> 00:23:30,567
We're gonna walk to the highway.
The phone is gonna work there.

276
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,607
That's what we're gonna do.
Listen. You'd be wise to let me go.

277
00:23:33,777 --> 00:23:36,109
You try to bring me in,
you're both gonna die.

278
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:38,941
How's that?
My men are following.

279
00:23:39,116 --> 00:23:41,744
Ex-military. They'll be here soon.

280
00:23:42,886 --> 00:23:45,081
Listen to me.
Hey, stay back.

281
00:23:45,255 --> 00:23:46,745
Stay back, man!
Listen, will you?

282
00:23:46,923 --> 00:23:48,686
Let me go.

283
00:23:48,892 --> 00:23:51,019
Stay here for an hour
and then go home.

284
00:23:51,194 --> 00:23:53,424
It's the best choice.
It's your only choice.

285
00:23:53,597 --> 00:23:54,689
Dad.

286
00:23:54,865 --> 00:23:57,800
He's right. Let's just let
him go. We've got the gun.

287
00:23:57,968 --> 00:23:59,526
He not gonna hurt us.
Just let him go.

288
00:23:59,703 --> 00:24:01,034
Be quiet.

289
00:24:01,204 --> 00:24:02,569
What's your name, son?

290
00:24:03,573 --> 00:24:05,768
Chris.
Chris is right.

291
00:24:05,942 --> 00:24:07,876
Let me go.

292
00:24:10,981 --> 00:24:13,415
Look, you look like a nice guy.

293
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,974
What's your name?

294
00:24:16,453 --> 00:24:19,251
He's Ray.
Ray.

295
00:24:19,656 --> 00:24:22,147
You don't wanna
be involved in this.

296
00:24:22,325 --> 00:24:24,156
You're way out of your depth.

297
00:24:25,328 --> 00:24:27,421
You said the wrong thing, mister.
What?

298
00:24:27,597 --> 00:24:30,065
He'll dig his toes in now.

299
00:24:31,601 --> 00:24:33,159
We're gonna go up
to the highway.

300
00:24:33,336 --> 00:24:35,497
Chris, you stay
behind me.

301
00:24:35,672 --> 00:24:36,661
You...

302
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,105
You stay in front of me
the whole way.

303
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,672
All right, let's go.

304
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:43,646
Come on.

305
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:47,781
Go.

306
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:06,969
Holy cow.

307
00:25:12,108 --> 00:25:13,097
Dispatch.

308
00:25:13,276 --> 00:25:14,743
MILES:
They can't have just vanished.

309
00:25:14,911 --> 00:25:16,003
Well, they seem to have.

310
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:18,340
It's unlikely he'll be
working alone.

311
00:25:18,515 --> 00:25:19,743
What gives you that idea?

312
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:22,578
We've got a lunch.
See what you can find out.

313
00:25:27,757 --> 00:25:29,782
Chris, give me that phone.

314
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,552
Keep moving.

315
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,395
Come on, come on,
come on.

316
00:25:39,836 --> 00:25:41,167
Great.

317
00:25:44,341 --> 00:25:46,070
Told you.

318
00:25:46,243 --> 00:25:48,108
That's the end of him.

319
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:50,178
Carden's still in that car.

320
00:25:50,347 --> 00:25:54,078
Underwater.
Maybe.

321
00:25:54,251 --> 00:25:55,616
Maybe?

322
00:25:58,088 --> 00:25:59,817
Maybe not.

323
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:05,555
Three people walked off over there.

324
00:26:05,729 --> 00:26:08,027
One's a woman, maybe a kid.

325
00:26:15,372 --> 00:26:18,205
Shit, man,
I hate scenery.

326
00:26:21,645 --> 00:26:25,081
Dad, we're
- We're close. The parking area's just down there.

327
00:26:29,786 --> 00:26:30,775
Chris, run ahead.

328
00:26:30,954 --> 00:26:33,286
He'll have a radio. Just
tell him to call the police.

329
00:26:33,456 --> 00:26:35,981
Tell him what happened. Go ahead.
That's not good idea.

330
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,389
Just- I wasn't asking
your advice. Go.

331
00:26:41,931 --> 00:26:43,660
Let's keep going.

332
00:26:56,012 --> 00:26:58,640
Car went over the embankment,
into the river, about a half-mile up.

333
00:26:58,815 --> 00:27:00,715
Sounds bad.
The current'll pull it down here.

334
00:27:00,884 --> 00:27:02,283
May still be somebody inside.

335
00:27:02,452 --> 00:27:04,420
Listen, can you guys help?
We can take the trail.

336
00:27:04,587 --> 00:27:06,748
It's only mile or so
down the river from here.

337
00:27:06,923 --> 00:27:08,117
Did you report it?

338
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:09,622
Yeah, I called it in.

339
00:27:22,272 --> 00:27:23,261
Chris?

340
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,907
Dad.
What's wrong?

341
00:27:25,075 --> 00:27:26,167
Dad. They shot him.

342
00:27:26,343 --> 00:27:28,106
What?
They shot him.

343
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:29,336
On the parking lot.
Who?

344
00:27:29,512 --> 00:27:31,173
They shot him.
Take a deep breath.

345
00:27:31,348 --> 00:27:32,645
Take a deep breath.
What happened?

346
00:27:32,816 --> 00:27:33,805
Where are you now?

347
00:27:33,983 --> 00:27:35,109
JOHNSON
Enjoying the hike.

348
00:27:35,285 --> 00:27:36,479
They must be near you.

349
00:27:36,653 --> 00:27:38,018
No one here yet.

350
00:27:38,188 --> 00:27:40,850
Well, just wait.
They'll show up.

351
00:27:41,024 --> 00:27:42,218
They'd better.

352
00:27:42,392 --> 00:27:45,156
You sure it's them?
I mean, it could have been anyone.

353
00:27:45,328 --> 00:27:48,058
Couple of fag nature lovers.

354
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:51,223
From the river? It's them.

355
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:55,260
I told you you were in too deep.

356
00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:07,114
All right.
Just let me think.

357
00:28:08,418 --> 00:28:10,318
We can go up he-

358
00:28:18,395 --> 00:28:19,885
Those your friends?

359
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,424
Okay.

360
00:28:26,136 --> 00:28:29,469
All right.
We're gonna go that way.

361
00:28:30,006 --> 00:28:31,906
Just do it. Go.

362
00:28:32,075 --> 00:28:34,168
Dad?
Where are we going?

363
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:36,039
Away from here.

364
00:28:36,813 --> 00:28:39,304
Come on, faster. Faster.

365
00:28:39,749 --> 00:28:41,410
They never got to the airport.

366
00:28:41,584 --> 00:28:43,518
Yeah, that was the message.

367
00:28:47,524 --> 00:28:49,151
You think it was them
that went over?

368
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:55,022
Could be. Unlikely they'd stop for a
turkey dinner and a couple of drinks.

369
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:57,025
DAVIS: What have you done with them?

370
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,395
Well, where's Carden?
Never made it here.

371
00:28:59,903 --> 00:29:01,768
You said there were three of them
on the trail.

372
00:29:01,938 --> 00:29:04,406
Yeah, they were.
They must have gone off the trail.

373
00:29:05,241 --> 00:29:06,435
They must've seen us.

374
00:29:19,355 --> 00:29:21,516
Gunga Din's
found something.

375
00:29:21,691 --> 00:29:22,885
They went that way.

376
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:24,993
Gunga Din was a water
carrier, not a tracker.

377
00:29:25,161 --> 00:29:27,186
They were right here.
You didn't see them?

378
00:29:27,363 --> 00:29:29,763
You need to back off, Davis.
Why don't you open your eyes?

379
00:29:29,933 --> 00:29:32,766
We got problem? We got a problem?
Shut up!

380
00:29:32,936 --> 00:29:35,496
That truck driver reported the
accident. We're gonna have company.

381
00:29:35,672 --> 00:29:38,072
This screw-up's growing by the
minute. We should cut and run.

382
00:29:38,241 --> 00:29:40,004
We got a big payday coming.

383
00:29:40,176 --> 00:29:41,734
Yeah.
They can't be too far ahead.

384
00:29:41,911 --> 00:29:43,105
We're going after them.

385
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,747
Get rid of that van.
I'll do it.

386
00:29:45,915 --> 00:29:46,904
Why?

387
00:29:48,785 --> 00:29:50,252
I like driving.

388
00:29:51,654 --> 00:29:53,053
Whatever, man.

389
00:29:53,923 --> 00:29:54,912
Go on.

390
00:29:57,994 --> 00:29:59,586
What makes you think
we'll see him again?

391
00:29:59,762 --> 00:30:00,751
Who cares if we don't?

392
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,898
His cupidity will overrule
his qualms.

393
00:30:04,634 --> 00:30:07,432
Yeah, I suppose that mean
he only wants his money, right?

394
00:30:07,604 --> 00:30:09,834
Right. Come on.

395
00:30:12,775 --> 00:30:14,436
Pick it up, Chris.

396
00:30:14,611 --> 00:30:16,772
Come on.
Come on.

397
00:30:19,082 --> 00:30:20,572
Come on, move.

398
00:30:47,343 --> 00:30:49,834
MILES That you, Davis?
Yeah. They're looking for Carden.

399
00:30:50,013 --> 00:30:51,310
Can you talk?
Yeah.

400
00:30:51,481 --> 00:30:53,210
Get rid of Carden.

401
00:30:53,816 --> 00:30:55,841
What?
He has to go, understand?

402
00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:58,078
Yeah.
Can you do it?

403
00:30:58,254 --> 00:31:01,655
Well, it's possible. It won't be easy.
Half a million.

404
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:05,427
How much?
You heard me. Half a million.

405
00:31:05,795 --> 00:31:09,822
You got my attention now.
Okay. All right.

406
00:31:32,555 --> 00:31:34,750
RAy:
This isn't looking good, Chris.

407
00:31:34,924 --> 00:31:37,154
You got any idea
where we're going yet?

408
00:31:37,327 --> 00:31:38,919
CHRIS:
Yeah.

409
00:31:39,095 --> 00:31:41,120
That's where they
dropped us off for orienteering.

410
00:31:41,297 --> 00:31:42,423
RAy:
You sure?

411
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:44,863
Yeah.
Yeah?

412
00:31:45,368 --> 00:31:46,357
They got any roads there?

413
00:31:46,536 --> 00:31:49,232
Got a Denny's, a Pancake
House, coffee shop, anything?

414
00:31:49,405 --> 00:31:51,771
There's a firebreak road
not too far on the other side.

415
00:31:51,941 --> 00:31:53,932
Yeah?
Yeah, I...

416
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,873
I got there first out of everybody.

417
00:31:56,045 --> 00:31:57,603
Did you?
Listen.

418
00:31:58,081 --> 00:32:00,777
Leave me here, you keep going.

419
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,885
They'll find me and you'll be gone.
No.

420
00:32:04,621 --> 00:32:07,215
Dad, you know what happened
to the guy up in the parking lot.

421
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:11,224
We- They'll follow us and-
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know.

422
00:32:11,394 --> 00:32:16,093
Till we're safe, you're with us.
Let's move.

423
00:32:19,936 --> 00:32:21,198
What's your name, anyway?

424
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:23,635
Carden. My name
is Frank Carden.

425
00:32:23,806 --> 00:32:25,831
I'm really sorry
I met you.

426
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:28,944
Not yet, sport. Not yet.

427
00:32:29,112 --> 00:32:30,875
We got a body
down here, chief.

428
00:32:31,047 --> 00:32:33,607
It's Stanfield.
ED Drowned?

429
00:32:33,783 --> 00:32:38,584
Drowned, shot, broken legs,
you name it. He's mess.

430
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:55,799
I got bad feeling your kid's lost, Ray.

431
00:32:55,972 --> 00:32:58,099
I'm not lost.

432
00:32:58,274 --> 00:32:59,798
We gotta go back.

433
00:32:59,976 --> 00:33:02,103
Dad, I'm not lost.
We can get down right here.

434
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:04,803
We can't do this. It's impossible.
Dad, come on.

435
00:33:04,981 --> 00:33:07,643
Don't argue with me, Chris.
Shut up, Dad, and listen to me.

436
00:33:07,817 --> 00:33:10,684
For once, just listen to me.
Aggressive kid, Ray.

437
00:33:10,853 --> 00:33:12,946
There's a way.
You don't know it, I do, all right?

438
00:33:13,122 --> 00:33:15,784
We did it on Outward Bound
and this is it. It's right down here.

439
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:19,860
You did that in the rain?
CHRIS: No, but it was easy.

440
00:33:20,029 --> 00:33:22,827
Once we get down there, there's
grabs and footholds cut into the rock.

441
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:25,467
Yeah, well, you were
tied together by a rope

442
00:33:25,635 --> 00:33:27,535
and you had a guide, am I right?

443
00:33:27,704 --> 00:33:29,103
Yeah, but...

444
00:33:29,272 --> 00:33:31,638
Look,
I know we can do this.

445
00:33:40,616 --> 00:33:42,413
Look, if you've got a death wish,

446
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:45,145
I can think of
less painful ways to die, Ray.

447
00:33:52,161 --> 00:33:54,026
Let's check it out.

448
00:33:55,198 --> 00:33:57,792
I can't manage
with these cuffs.

449
00:33:59,335 --> 00:34:01,462
If you try anything...

450
00:34:01,637 --> 00:34:03,161
I'm gonna be
right behind you.

451
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:05,671
I swear to Christ,
I'll push you right off that ledge.

452
00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:06,968
What are you,
a cop?

453
00:34:07,143 --> 00:34:10,010
Used to be. Not now.
I teach high-school gym.

454
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:13,046
Jesus.
Must be a tough school.

455
00:34:39,475 --> 00:34:41,739
Slowly, Chris, slowly.

456
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:51,279
Whoa!

457
00:34:52,421 --> 00:34:54,446
Chris! You okay?
CHRIS: Yeah.

458
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,518
I'm okay.

459
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:23,610
Hell, man.
Did they double back?

460
00:35:23,786 --> 00:35:26,914
No, we'd have seen them.
They must've gone on.

461
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:28,954
Well,
I don't see how.

462
00:35:30,593 --> 00:35:33,027
All right. All right.

463
00:35:33,196 --> 00:35:35,357
I got you. I got you.

464
00:35:35,531 --> 00:35:36,623
There's a cave over there.

465
00:35:52,582 --> 00:35:54,015
Ready?

466
00:35:58,187 --> 00:36:01,247
Okay. Okay. Come on.
Come on, come on.

467
00:36:03,025 --> 00:36:04,549
Chris.
Dad!

468
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:06,558
Dad! Dad!

469
00:36:06,929 --> 00:36:08,658
Hold on to him!
Get me up!

470
00:36:09,131 --> 00:36:10,257
Turner.

471
00:36:10,433 --> 00:36:12,765
What?
I think I heard something.

472
00:36:14,904 --> 00:36:16,735
Find the toehold.

473
00:36:18,608 --> 00:36:20,098
I got you.

474
00:36:20,276 --> 00:36:21,641
Keep calm, keep calm.

475
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:24,842
Come on.

476
00:36:33,189 --> 00:36:36,488
That's it.
Hold on, Chris. Hold on. He's got you.

477
00:36:38,761 --> 00:36:41,457
All right, here we are.

478
00:37:07,823 --> 00:37:09,916
Chris, will you help me, please?

479
00:37:19,835 --> 00:37:22,201
Stop. Just stop.

480
00:37:24,974 --> 00:37:28,000
Get up. Get the fuck off my dad.

481
00:37:31,547 --> 00:37:32,536
Give me the gun.

482
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,474
No.

483
00:37:43,926 --> 00:37:46,156
Okay, take up the slack.

484
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:48,092
That's good.

485
00:37:48,264 --> 00:37:50,459
Keep it coming.

486
00:37:52,802 --> 00:37:54,030
No sign of Carden, eh?

487
00:37:54,203 --> 00:37:56,194
Nah, just the two feds.

488
00:37:56,372 --> 00:37:58,203
One of them's still in there.

489
00:37:58,374 --> 00:37:59,363
Yeah.

490
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:02,477
Well, thanks. Who's
this Carden guy, anyway?

491
00:38:02,645 --> 00:38:06,706
All I know is he's pretty
important to some folks in D.C.

492
00:38:06,882 --> 00:38:08,144
Think he's a terrorist?

493
00:38:08,317 --> 00:38:09,978
No. Doubt it.

494
00:38:10,152 --> 00:38:12,086
He looked ordinary enough.

495
00:38:12,254 --> 00:38:15,712
Yeah, but isn't that what those guys
look like? Ordinary, just like us.

496
00:38:15,891 --> 00:38:20,225
Like me, maybe.
Nothing ordinary about you, Maury.

497
00:38:22,231 --> 00:38:24,324
Tell you one thing.
What's that?

498
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,128
We play this right, we'll be getting
our pictures in the paper.

499
00:38:27,303 --> 00:38:29,328
Let's set up for a wide shot
of the car,

500
00:38:29,505 --> 00:38:31,097
and then we'll get
my close-up.

501
00:38:35,244 --> 00:38:37,906
I'm back. Where are you clowns?

502
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,980
JOHNSON 40.083 north.
Yeah.

503
00:38:40,149 --> 00:38:41,582
25.55 west.

504
00:38:43,753 --> 00:38:44,845
Okay.

505
00:39:10,146 --> 00:39:13,081
You'll have to manage.
I'm not taking those off again.

506
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,181
Can't blame me
for trying.

507
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:23,486
You're pretty tough for an old guy.

508
00:39:25,194 --> 00:39:27,162
Military training.

509
00:39:29,398 --> 00:39:31,298
What's this all about?
What do they want you for?

510
00:39:33,302 --> 00:39:34,701
Caught me smoking
in a restaurant.

511
00:39:36,205 --> 00:39:38,867
Pretty serious about that
these days, you know?

512
00:39:41,343 --> 00:39:43,436
Who are the guys
who are following us?

513
00:39:43,612 --> 00:39:44,806
Friends.

514
00:39:45,381 --> 00:39:46,746
Not your friends.

515
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:54,255
So you teach gym?
Yeah.

516
00:39:55,224 --> 00:39:58,591
And he coaches baseball
and basketball in the winter.

517
00:39:58,761 --> 00:40:00,251
Really?

518
00:40:02,131 --> 00:40:03,155
I like baseball.

519
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:06,824
CHRIS:
So what exactly do you do, mister?

520
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,203
Honestly.

521
00:40:14,243 --> 00:40:15,733
I'm an exterminator.

522
00:40:16,011 --> 00:40:19,037
Exterminat-
You mean, like, termites?

523
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:23,341
No, not exactly.

524
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:26,079
I'm contracted to eliminate...

525
00:40:27,123 --> 00:40:31,082
Well, let's call them
obstacles to progress.

526
00:40:33,095 --> 00:40:35,461
"Obstacles to progress. "

527
00:40:35,631 --> 00:40:37,861
So you're just a mercenary?

528
00:40:38,234 --> 00:40:41,067
Doesn't matter
who you "exterminate"?

529
00:40:42,204 --> 00:40:43,865
There are limits.

530
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,208
Haven't found them yet.

531
00:40:47,843 --> 00:40:49,105
He's not serious, is he, Dad?

532
00:40:49,478 --> 00:40:51,571
No, he's full of shit.

533
00:40:51,747 --> 00:40:53,442
Probably caught him
for insider trading.

534
00:40:54,216 --> 00:40:55,945
I don't know.

535
00:40:56,752 --> 00:40:58,413
Look how he
stopped me from falling.

536
00:40:58,787 --> 00:41:00,277
That was just a reflex.

537
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,517
Wouldn't get
too sentimental about it.

538
00:41:02,691 --> 00:41:04,454
Oh, I'm not getting
sentimental about it.

539
00:41:05,694 --> 00:41:07,559
I think I know
what you're capable of.

540
00:41:16,972 --> 00:41:19,167
Stopping
for a picnic.

541
00:41:19,542 --> 00:41:22,477
We lost the trail.
You sure they came through here?

542
00:41:23,946 --> 00:41:25,072
Sure, I'm sure.

543
00:41:25,247 --> 00:41:29,081
By tomorrow, every cop
from the state gonna be here.

544
00:41:29,251 --> 00:41:30,240
Three U.S. Marshals dead?

545
00:41:30,419 --> 00:41:32,910
Shit, man, they're gonna
look for us under every stone.

546
00:41:33,088 --> 00:41:34,282
What's up, Royko?

547
00:41:34,456 --> 00:41:35,582
You wanna quit?

548
00:41:35,758 --> 00:41:37,225
I don't know, man.

549
00:41:37,393 --> 00:41:39,156
I don't know.
Johnson.

550
00:41:40,729 --> 00:41:43,163
Think I can pick up the trail
in the morning.

551
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,361
We all know
what you wanna do.

552
00:41:46,535 --> 00:41:47,695
I say we go on.

553
00:41:48,204 --> 00:41:51,071
We'll find him.
Now, that's a change, Davis.

554
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,366
What you about, man?

555
00:41:52,541 --> 00:41:54,566
The sweet stench of money.

556
00:41:54,743 --> 00:41:56,210
That's it.

557
00:41:56,378 --> 00:41:57,936
Now let's give Gunga Din a chance.

558
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,311
We'll pick up his trail
in the morning.

559
00:42:18,167 --> 00:42:19,794
ROBBINS: Who's Wainwright?
That'd be me.

560
00:42:20,302 --> 00:42:21,735
ROBBINS: Chuck Robbins,
U.S. Marshal's Office.

561
00:42:21,904 --> 00:42:23,531
How do you do?
ROBBINS: Gordon Jennings.

562
00:42:23,706 --> 00:42:25,765
Mr. Jennings.
Gwen Miles from D.C.

563
00:42:25,941 --> 00:42:27,772
Ma'am.
Gwen.

564
00:42:27,943 --> 00:42:29,376
Anything new for us, fellas?

565
00:42:29,878 --> 00:42:32,039
Well, the boys
found some tracks.

566
00:42:32,214 --> 00:42:33,647
JENNINGS:
What sort of tracks?

567
00:42:33,816 --> 00:42:38,185
Three people leading away from the
river where Stanfield was found.

568
00:42:38,621 --> 00:42:39,610
Carden?

569
00:42:39,788 --> 00:42:40,914
Possible.

570
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,115
What about the other two?

571
00:42:43,759 --> 00:42:45,124
Forgot my crystal ball.

572
00:42:45,294 --> 00:42:46,283
Thanks, chief.

573
00:42:46,462 --> 00:42:47,793
You're welcome.

574
00:42:47,963 --> 00:42:51,262
You gentlemen, the FBl will be taking
over the crime scene, thank you.

575
00:42:51,667 --> 00:42:53,066
What?
If that's what you want.

576
00:42:53,235 --> 00:42:54,327
That's what we want.

577
00:42:54,503 --> 00:42:57,404
The U.S. Marshals
will handle the search.

578
00:42:57,573 --> 00:42:59,837
Well, that just leaves us
to get coffee then, doesn't it?

579
00:43:00,142 --> 00:43:01,803
Be great if you
could arrange some.

580
00:43:01,977 --> 00:43:04,878
Double espresso,
decaf, no sugar.

581
00:43:06,148 --> 00:43:07,581
Two.

582
00:43:12,755 --> 00:43:15,952
Wow. FBl.

583
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:19,583
Don't say that out loud, Maury,
or they'll think you're a hick.

584
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:28,632
Chris, wake up.

585
00:43:28,804 --> 00:43:30,863
Chris.
Why don't you let him sleep?

586
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,473
What is it,
6:00 in the morning?

587
00:43:32,641 --> 00:43:34,370
We're going.

588
00:43:35,444 --> 00:43:37,776
Oh, I got
a cramp.

589
00:43:37,946 --> 00:43:40,141
I'm sorry to
hear that, Frank.

590
00:43:40,316 --> 00:43:42,250
What about breakfast?

591
00:43:42,518 --> 00:43:44,918
This look like
the Hilton to you?

592
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,664
I told you, there's no point
in coming here.

593
00:43:58,834 --> 00:44:00,267
They must've doubled back.

594
00:44:00,436 --> 00:44:02,461
Wouldn't you have seen them?
Maybe not.

595
00:44:02,638 --> 00:44:03,764
DAVIS:
Oh, Jesus.

596
00:44:03,939 --> 00:44:06,464
If I'd been here, we'd have them now.
How do you figure that?

597
00:44:06,642 --> 00:44:08,872
Because I wouldn't
have lost them.

598
00:44:10,379 --> 00:44:11,539
Can I shoot him?

599
00:44:11,714 --> 00:44:13,682
Not yet. Hey, Davis?

600
00:44:14,416 --> 00:44:16,008
Don't go entering
any charm competitions.

601
00:44:16,185 --> 00:44:17,413
You'd never
make the cut.

602
00:44:20,956 --> 00:44:22,389
Hey.

603
00:44:28,897 --> 00:44:30,091
Shit.

604
00:44:30,265 --> 00:44:32,563
They must have
parachuted down.

605
00:44:34,002 --> 00:44:35,833
They went down here.

606
00:44:36,271 --> 00:44:38,262
Carden could be
anywhere by now.

607
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,566
He could be dead.

608
00:44:39,742 --> 00:44:42,233
Don't make any assumptions
about Frank Carden.

609
00:44:42,411 --> 00:44:43,742
JENNINGS:
Why not?

610
00:44:43,912 --> 00:44:45,573
They usually turn out to be wrong.

611
00:44:45,748 --> 00:44:47,511
Oh, do they?

612
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:49,713
You don't know him, do you?

613
00:44:49,885 --> 00:44:52,410
Got his file.
And?

614
00:44:52,588 --> 00:44:54,852
Defense Intelligence
used him on covert ops.

615
00:44:55,023 --> 00:44:56,149
As what, an assassin or...?

616
00:44:56,325 --> 00:44:57,815
He wasn't delivering pizzas.

617
00:44:59,595 --> 00:45:01,620
No expresso.

618
00:45:03,031 --> 00:45:04,055
Your sugar.

619
00:45:05,367 --> 00:45:06,959
Cream.

620
00:45:07,703 --> 00:45:08,692
Lousy?

621
00:45:09,471 --> 00:45:10,733
Lousy.

622
00:45:11,407 --> 00:45:14,137
Donuts.
No.

623
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:15,841
Thanks, chief.

624
00:45:20,549 --> 00:45:22,676
Pardon me.
Come on.

625
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:25,143
MILES: You know the worst
thing about all this?

626
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,480
What?

627
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:30,523
You leave the East Coast,
coffee's no good, food's all sugar.

628
00:45:31,493 --> 00:45:34,155
So why is Carden here?

629
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,096
The president of the United States
is coming to Woodburn tomorrow.

630
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:45,035
You think the president's the target?
Maybe.

631
00:45:45,207 --> 00:45:46,401
Why not?

632
00:45:47,209 --> 00:45:49,336
Okay, so who wants
to take out the president?

633
00:45:49,945 --> 00:45:51,640
You're kidding.

634
00:46:09,731 --> 00:46:11,096
RAy:
Keep going, Chris. Keep going.

635
00:46:11,266 --> 00:46:12,927
He'll come back, don't worry.

636
00:46:13,101 --> 00:46:14,568
I wouldn't count on that too much.

637
00:46:14,736 --> 00:46:15,930
Why's that?

638
00:46:16,104 --> 00:46:18,698
Well, my men would have figured
out their mistake by now.

639
00:46:18,874 --> 00:46:20,842
They won't be far behind us.

640
00:46:21,009 --> 00:46:23,170
One of them's
a professional tracker.

641
00:46:23,345 --> 00:46:25,506
Trained in Australia
by aboriginals.

642
00:46:25,681 --> 00:46:27,876
Frank. Frank.
You know those aboriginals- Huh?

643
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:29,381
Shut up.

644
00:46:56,712 --> 00:46:58,737
Time like this,
you're playing chess.

645
00:46:58,914 --> 00:47:00,677
I'm gonna get this guy.

646
00:47:00,849 --> 00:47:02,680
DAVIS: Pussy game.
Shit.

647
00:47:02,851 --> 00:47:04,910
You and I finally agree
on something, Davis.

648
00:47:08,457 --> 00:47:09,651
Let's move.

649
00:47:09,825 --> 00:47:11,759
Take it easy.
We'll get them.

650
00:47:11,927 --> 00:47:13,189
I'm sure of one thing.

651
00:47:13,362 --> 00:47:16,126
Frank will find ways
of slowing them up.

652
00:47:45,494 --> 00:47:47,121
How long have you been a teacher?

653
00:47:47,396 --> 00:47:48,829
Just a few years.

654
00:47:48,997 --> 00:47:50,862
Must be good at it.

655
00:47:51,266 --> 00:47:52,961
I'm all right, I guess.

656
00:47:53,135 --> 00:47:56,104
Is he, Chris?
He seems to think so.

657
00:47:56,271 --> 00:47:58,739
He's kind of strict.
Hold up.

658
00:47:59,274 --> 00:48:01,003
Wait a sec.

659
00:48:01,476 --> 00:48:03,068
Water.

660
00:48:12,254 --> 00:48:13,380
Want some?

661
00:48:13,555 --> 00:48:15,079
Please.

662
00:48:23,498 --> 00:48:25,864
You lose your wife to cancer?

663
00:48:29,071 --> 00:48:30,698
Yeah, I did.

664
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,240
Two years ago, actually.

665
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:35,776
Sorry.

666
00:48:44,052 --> 00:48:45,349
Are you really?

667
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,387
I find that kind of hard to
believe. I don't know why.

668
00:48:48,557 --> 00:48:49,581
Why?

669
00:48:49,758 --> 00:48:51,089
Because of my profession?

670
00:48:52,461 --> 00:48:54,292
Maybe.

671
00:48:58,066 --> 00:48:59,533
Chris.

672
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:03,237
They used to give me
medals for it.

673
00:49:03,405 --> 00:49:05,430
Do you believe that?
RAy: And now?

674
00:49:05,607 --> 00:49:10,044
Well, now with political correctness
and all, it's best to keep a low profile.

675
00:49:10,612 --> 00:49:12,603
Heroes are out of fashion.

676
00:49:13,782 --> 00:49:15,613
You telling me
you're a spook?

677
00:49:15,784 --> 00:49:18,514
Military? You work for the
government? CIA guy, is that it?

678
00:49:18,687 --> 00:49:19,676
Used to.

679
00:49:19,855 --> 00:49:20,947
No more.

680
00:49:21,123 --> 00:49:22,488
No?

681
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:24,484
Who do you work for?

682
00:49:25,227 --> 00:49:27,354
I really don't know, Ray.

683
00:49:27,529 --> 00:49:29,292
Pressure groups.

684
00:49:29,464 --> 00:49:31,227
People with an agenda.

685
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,958
People who can afford it.

686
00:49:33,135 --> 00:49:35,296
And you just don't
question the agenda, huh?

687
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:37,665
Well, as time goes on,
you know,

688
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:40,330
you realize that the issues
are just too complicated.

689
00:49:40,509 --> 00:49:42,602
Sure.
Who's right, who's wrong.

690
00:49:42,778 --> 00:49:43,938
So you just...

691
00:49:45,247 --> 00:49:47,408
Just wind up doing your job.

692
00:49:47,582 --> 00:49:49,982
And you do it the best way you can.
Like everybody else.

693
00:49:51,086 --> 00:49:53,145
Okay. We should move on.
I mean,

694
00:49:53,321 --> 00:49:55,653
it's kind of late for me
to be thinking about changing.

695
00:49:55,824 --> 00:49:57,815
I mean, hell, what would I do?

696
00:49:58,226 --> 00:50:00,353
I don't know, Frank. Let's go.
Come on, move.

697
00:50:00,529 --> 00:50:02,929
Come on, man.
Sell insurance?

698
00:50:03,098 --> 00:50:05,123
RAy:
I don't care, Frank.

699
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:08,297
Maybe go back to school.
Get a law degree.

700
00:50:24,686 --> 00:50:27,985
Hey! What do you think
you're doing?

701
00:50:28,156 --> 00:50:32,490
I grew up in Cedar Pine-
Can't you get some more choppers?

702
00:50:32,661 --> 00:50:34,390
I put in a request.

703
00:50:34,563 --> 00:50:36,463
It's not that easy up here,
Mr. Jennings.

704
00:50:36,631 --> 00:50:39,156
This isn't D.C.
It's Washington state.

705
00:50:39,334 --> 00:50:41,598
Ain't that the truth, chief?

706
00:50:44,573 --> 00:50:46,063
I don't believe any of this.

707
00:50:46,241 --> 00:50:48,266
And anyway,
it's got nothing to do with us.

708
00:50:48,443 --> 00:50:50,206
It had nothing to do with us
24 hours ago.

709
00:50:50,378 --> 00:50:52,175
Told you we should have
gone to San Francisco.

710
00:50:52,347 --> 00:50:54,713
Oh, and be pestered
by your mother?

711
00:50:54,883 --> 00:50:58,478
What's he done, anyway?
I don't know, but it's screwed up.

712
00:50:58,653 --> 00:51:01,247
I'm telling you, his men are coming.
You go your way.

713
00:51:01,423 --> 00:51:04,187
You move this way. Now.
We'll go ours.

714
00:51:04,359 --> 00:51:07,328
We see the police, we'll tell them.
I don't want to get involved with this.

715
00:51:07,496 --> 00:51:10,624
Come on, Sandra.
I think it's a mistake.

716
00:51:10,799 --> 00:51:13,029
Didn't he say those men
are coming this way?

717
00:51:13,468 --> 00:51:15,197
How do we know that's true?

718
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:18,036
Well, how do we know it isn't?

719
00:51:19,941 --> 00:51:22,933
They're headed here. There's
a ravine or something.

720
00:51:23,111 --> 00:51:25,204
When they get there,
they'll be trapped.

721
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,109
Maybe there's a bridge.

722
00:51:27,449 --> 00:51:29,178
It's not on the map.

723
00:51:29,351 --> 00:51:32,548
Yeah, but whoever's got Carden,
he knows this terrain pretty good.

724
00:51:32,721 --> 00:51:34,211
Otherwise, we'd have caught him by now.

725
00:51:34,389 --> 00:51:36,755
We better think of something
quick or else we'll lose him.

726
00:51:36,925 --> 00:51:38,483
Well, what do you suggest?

727
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,821
Whose idea was it
to go camping?

728
00:51:40,996 --> 00:51:42,190
You think-?

729
00:51:42,364 --> 00:51:45,595
You think that I planned
for us to meet these lunatics?

730
00:51:45,767 --> 00:51:48,167
Or just to make the hike
more exciting?

731
00:51:48,336 --> 00:51:50,896
San Francisco would have
been breakfast in bed,

732
00:51:51,072 --> 00:51:53,404
tennis in the afternoon,
a few cocktails...

733
00:51:53,575 --> 00:51:57,477
Yeah? And lots and lots of-
Hey.

734
00:51:58,647 --> 00:52:02,105
Lots and lots of great seafood.
Yeah.

735
00:52:02,284 --> 00:52:03,751
And wine.

736
00:52:18,433 --> 00:52:20,196
COP 1
Chief?

737
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:23,533
Yeah, go ahead.

738
00:52:23,705 --> 00:52:25,798
We got something up here.

739
00:52:26,141 --> 00:52:27,335
Yeah, what is it?

740
00:52:29,277 --> 00:52:32,075
Sorry, false alarm.
Just a couple of hikers.

741
00:52:32,347 --> 00:52:34,815
Looks like one of them's hurt.
Yeah, well, check it out

742
00:52:34,983 --> 00:52:37,713
and get back to me, all right?
Copy that.

743
00:52:39,621 --> 00:52:41,088
We'd spend weeks
searching this-

744
00:53:01,643 --> 00:53:04,510
It's okay, buddy, just stay calm.
I'm gonna help you ou- Ugh!

745
00:53:06,014 --> 00:53:08,346
ED
Aerial 4, come in, please.

746
00:53:09,184 --> 00:53:10,708
Marty, can you hear me?

747
00:53:12,053 --> 00:53:13,384
Marty, come in.

748
00:53:19,327 --> 00:53:21,852
Aerial 4. Come in, Marty.

749
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:23,122
Marty, can you hear me?

750
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:31,230
Now, don't tell me
you don't know how to fly this thing.

751
00:53:32,407 --> 00:53:33,567
No, I don't.

752
00:53:36,344 --> 00:53:38,869
Get in the freaking chopper, man.

753
00:53:44,619 --> 00:53:47,144
Less-traveled path, eh?

754
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:50,515
RAy:
"The Road Not Taken. "

755
00:53:50,825 --> 00:53:52,816
You like Frost, do you, Ray?

756
00:53:52,994 --> 00:53:55,258
Yeah. I'm surprised you do.
Doesn't seem your speed.

757
00:53:55,764 --> 00:53:57,254
Yes, one of my favorites.

758
00:53:57,432 --> 00:54:01,994
I took the road less traveled by,
and it made all the difference.

759
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:05,537
A lot of forks in the road. You seem
to have taken all the wrong ones.

760
00:54:05,707 --> 00:54:08,972
Is this a good time
to discuss poetry?

761
00:54:16,751 --> 00:54:18,651
The hell is this?

762
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,152
CHRIS:
It's from an old glacier.

763
00:54:21,323 --> 00:54:24,156
That's what they told us last time.
It's called a moraine.

764
00:54:24,326 --> 00:54:27,420
Great.
Rocks brought down in the Ice Age.

765
00:54:27,595 --> 00:54:29,825
CHRIS: He's right.
Moraine, that was the word.

766
00:54:29,998 --> 00:54:32,364
If I don't do this,
they're gonna kill me, right?

767
00:54:32,534 --> 00:54:33,933
RAy:
There's a good chance.

768
00:54:34,269 --> 00:54:35,793
I think so.

769
00:54:35,971 --> 00:54:37,097
Look,

770
00:54:37,272 --> 00:54:39,502
I'm not gonna be able to do this
with cuffs on.

771
00:54:39,674 --> 00:54:40,902
I need the balance.

772
00:54:44,145 --> 00:54:45,134
Okay.

773
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,210
But you can cuff them in front.

774
00:55:33,261 --> 00:55:35,161
Whoa!
Ah!

775
00:55:43,671 --> 00:55:45,434
CHRIS: Hey, Dad?
Yeah.

776
00:55:45,907 --> 00:55:49,707
I just wanted to say that I'm really
sorry that I got you into all this-

777
00:55:49,878 --> 00:55:51,846
I was the one who said
we should go camping.

778
00:55:52,013 --> 00:55:55,449
Yeah, but only because
I was being so stupid and-

779
00:55:55,617 --> 00:55:58,415
Well, look,
the situation could be worse.

780
00:55:58,753 --> 00:56:00,152
CHRIS:
You think?

781
00:56:00,588 --> 00:56:02,647
Actually, no.

782
00:56:05,627 --> 00:56:08,619
Okay. Carden, stop.

783
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,392
Chris.

784
00:56:14,302 --> 00:56:17,533
If he moves, I want you to point
that at his legs and shoot him.

785
00:56:17,705 --> 00:56:19,138
Now, hold on.

786
00:56:19,307 --> 00:56:22,936
I don't wanna kill the bastard,
I just wanna slow him down.

787
00:56:23,178 --> 00:56:25,578
Hey, this thing
is kind of flimsy.

788
00:56:25,747 --> 00:56:27,374
I could...

789
00:56:29,651 --> 00:56:31,812
Wanna help?
No.

790
00:56:31,986 --> 00:56:34,716
I won't destroy government property.
Oh, for God's sakes.

791
00:56:34,889 --> 00:56:38,518
I'm a stockbroker. I'd lose my license.
Don't be such an ass, go help him.

792
00:56:41,096 --> 00:56:43,428
Come on, man. Come on.

793
00:56:47,836 --> 00:56:50,236
Okay, what?
You push from up here.

794
00:56:50,405 --> 00:56:52,703
I'm gonna go
down here.

795
00:56:53,508 --> 00:56:55,100
All right.

796
00:56:57,412 --> 00:56:59,004
All right.

797
00:57:02,717 --> 00:57:04,548
Yeah, it's pretty loose. Ready?
Fine. Yes.

798
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:06,209
Chris, you all right?
Yeah.

799
00:57:08,022 --> 00:57:09,182
One.

800
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:12,583
Two.

801
00:57:18,266 --> 00:57:20,063
Coming out.

802
00:57:21,069 --> 00:57:23,162
I don't have to help.
RAy: One.

803
00:57:23,338 --> 00:57:24,327
I'm the bad guy.

804
00:57:24,506 --> 00:57:25,666
RAy: Two.
Two.

805
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,307
Three.

806
00:57:27,475 --> 00:57:28,840
Watch it.

807
00:57:32,881 --> 00:57:34,246
All right.

808
00:57:57,772 --> 00:57:58,966
RAy:
Hey!

809
00:58:09,284 --> 00:58:10,308
Got them.

810
00:58:12,287 --> 00:58:13,276
Hey!

811
00:58:13,454 --> 00:58:14,614
Over here!
CHRIS: Right here!

812
00:58:14,789 --> 00:58:16,620
RAy: We're right here!
Hey!

813
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:19,385
Here, take this. Just watch him.
What?

814
00:58:19,561 --> 00:58:20,653
Hey!

815
00:58:20,828 --> 00:58:22,125
- Hey.
- Over here, come here.

816
00:58:22,297 --> 00:58:23,389
RAy: All right!
Hey!

817
00:58:23,565 --> 00:58:25,294
Here!
CHRIS: Come here. We're right here!

818
00:58:25,466 --> 00:58:27,400
Hey!
CHRIS: Come on. Come on, hurry!

819
00:58:27,602 --> 00:58:29,968
Hey, here we are!
Over here!

820
00:58:30,138 --> 00:58:33,232
Get the guy with the gun.
Don't miss.

821
00:58:34,142 --> 00:58:36,906
Hey! We're right here! Come here!
Hey!

822
00:58:37,078 --> 00:58:38,409
Hey!

823
00:58:38,746 --> 00:58:41,374
Hey!
CHRIS: Over here! Right here!

824
00:58:41,549 --> 00:58:42,811
Bye, old man.

825
00:58:46,087 --> 00:58:49,523
Think you can hold this thing steady?
I'm trying, man. There's an updraft.

826
00:58:56,497 --> 00:58:57,930
Chris, go to the trees.

827
00:59:02,971 --> 00:59:04,097
Get down.

828
00:59:06,941 --> 00:59:09,409
We gotta get out of here
now. Come on. We gotta go.

829
00:59:21,356 --> 00:59:22,550
You okay?

830
01:00:02,697 --> 01:00:04,392
I can't get a clear shot.

831
01:00:04,565 --> 01:00:07,125
I'll fix him. Find somewhere to drop me.

832
01:01:05,026 --> 01:01:06,015
Got him.

833
01:01:06,194 --> 01:01:07,855
Good man.

834
01:01:17,505 --> 01:01:18,631
I hate amateurs.

835
01:02:03,217 --> 01:02:05,685
Jesus.
I thought Johnson took him out.

836
01:02:06,687 --> 01:02:08,518
DAVIS:
Where is he?

837
01:02:14,328 --> 01:02:18,321
That mother's hitting the tail rotor.
Get us the hell out of here. Come on.

838
01:03:03,678 --> 01:03:05,305
Can't you set it down?

839
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:08,044
I can't control it.

840
01:03:23,731 --> 01:03:24,789
Hold on.

841
01:03:33,908 --> 01:03:35,307
No!

842
01:03:43,918 --> 01:03:46,182
Where did you learn to
fly, man? Disneyland?

843
01:03:46,654 --> 01:03:48,087
Jesus Christ!
What'd you say?

844
01:03:48,256 --> 01:03:50,588
For chrissake, kill each
other later. Get out!

845
01:03:50,758 --> 01:03:52,453
You wanna piece of me?
Hands off.

846
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:53,854
Son of a bitch.

847
01:04:07,808 --> 01:04:09,571
CHRIS:
Dad.

848
01:04:09,744 --> 01:04:11,769
What about Lochlan? We
gotta go back and get him.

849
01:04:11,946 --> 01:04:14,972
Can't. I saw them in the helicopter.
We can't leave him.

850
01:04:15,283 --> 01:04:17,513
Your friend's beyond help, miss.

851
01:04:17,685 --> 01:04:19,209
And this may sound
a bit insensitive,

852
01:04:19,387 --> 01:04:21,378
but you two didn't seem
very well suited.

853
01:04:28,162 --> 01:04:29,789
Chris.

854
01:04:30,064 --> 01:04:31,497
CHRIS:
Come on. Come on.

855
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:39,262
What an incredibly screwed-up
thing to say, Frank.

856
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,840
Get your sorry ass up.

857
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:44,237
Move.

858
01:05:11,539 --> 01:05:13,166
Here come
Laurel and Hardy.

859
01:05:16,978 --> 01:05:19,242
Here, Ed. Here.

860
01:05:19,847 --> 01:05:22,372
Here you go.
Oh, no more coffee.

861
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:25,246
Did you find the croissants?
No one in town's ever heard of them.

862
01:05:25,419 --> 01:05:28,388
I've got some news. A pilot
reported that missing chopper.

863
01:05:28,556 --> 01:05:29,784
Crashed.
Yes?

864
01:05:29,957 --> 01:05:32,289
No one's there, and he
didn't see any bodies, either.

865
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:34,360
Well, didn't he land
and check it out?

866
01:05:34,528 --> 01:05:37,861
"Nowhere to put it down," he says. It's
rough country out there, Mr. Jennings.

867
01:05:38,299 --> 01:05:40,927
So now we need
Lewis and Clark.

868
01:05:41,102 --> 01:05:43,536
I'll put some men on it.
It'll take awhile, though.

869
01:05:43,704 --> 01:05:45,899
Is that a country "while",
chief?

870
01:05:46,073 --> 01:05:49,668
Jeez, for crying out-!
Gee, I'm sorry, Mr. Jennings.

871
01:05:49,844 --> 01:05:52,540
You know, we're kind of
clumsy out here in the woods.

872
01:05:52,713 --> 01:05:53,771
Damn it.

873
01:06:02,023 --> 01:06:03,456
See?

874
01:06:03,624 --> 01:06:05,148
And there's a phone there?

875
01:06:05,326 --> 01:06:07,590
CHRIS: Yeah. This is where we
slept when we went kayaking.

876
01:06:07,862 --> 01:06:09,557
Let's go.

877
01:06:26,447 --> 01:06:28,039
All right.

878
01:06:28,949 --> 01:06:31,713
It's dead.
It's what?

879
01:06:34,722 --> 01:06:37,555
Chris, you said there was a phone.
That is a phone.

880
01:06:37,725 --> 01:06:41,126
I didn't know it wouldn't be working.
Sorry, it's too early in the season.

881
01:06:41,295 --> 01:06:42,523
RAy:
Right.

882
01:06:43,097 --> 01:06:44,655
All right.

883
01:06:47,768 --> 01:06:48,894
To the bed.
What?

884
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:50,935
Come on, Frank!

885
01:06:52,373 --> 01:06:55,171
What are you, new? We shou-

886
01:07:01,115 --> 01:07:04,642
Chris, what about kayaks?
CHRIS: They're not there. I'm sorry.

887
01:07:04,819 --> 01:07:07,287
It's too early in the season.
It's too early in the season.

888
01:07:09,557 --> 01:07:11,388
So what do we do now, Ray?

889
01:07:11,959 --> 01:07:13,893
No idea.

890
01:07:14,695 --> 01:07:17,095
Well, I've had it.

891
01:07:17,264 --> 01:07:18,993
I need a rest.

892
01:07:28,976 --> 01:07:32,070
DAVIS: This guy was supposed to
be red-hot. Some amateur got him.

893
01:07:32,246 --> 01:07:34,578
Probably just a lucky shot.

894
01:07:34,749 --> 01:07:37,013
Even a blind hog
finds some acorns.

895
01:07:37,184 --> 01:07:38,981
If we don't get Carden
before tomorrow,

896
01:07:39,153 --> 01:07:41,178
we miss the window
for the contract.

897
01:07:41,355 --> 01:07:43,220
What, he send you
an e-mail?

898
01:07:43,824 --> 01:07:46,122
Maybe as good as.

899
01:07:54,735 --> 01:07:56,703
Well, look at that.

900
01:07:56,871 --> 01:07:59,135
And that's a dead end.

901
01:08:27,468 --> 01:08:29,163
Sandra.

902
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:32,671
What? I- Ray.

903
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,637
Oh, for shit's sake.
Ray.

904
01:08:35,009 --> 01:08:38,604
What do you think you're doing? You
think this is some sort of a game?

905
01:08:38,779 --> 01:08:41,475
You think this is O.K. Corral
and you're an action hero?

906
01:08:41,649 --> 01:08:45,278
You're a teacher, for God's sake!
Wise up!

907
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:49,314
Chris, talk to your dad.
Try to talk some sense into him.

908
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:51,390
He seems to listen to you.

909
01:08:51,559 --> 01:08:53,959
You think so?
Yeah.

910
01:08:54,128 --> 01:08:55,425
It's funny, I...

911
01:08:57,364 --> 01:08:59,332
never thought he did.

912
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,969
Okay, so you want me to
convince him to let you go?

913
01:09:03,137 --> 01:09:04,365
Yeah, something like that.

914
01:09:04,538 --> 01:09:07,632
Yeah, but then what's stopping you
and your friends from killing us all?

915
01:09:07,808 --> 01:09:10,436
No. That won't happen.
My word on it.

916
01:09:11,045 --> 01:09:13,479
You've been real good
at stopping them so far, Frank.

917
01:09:13,714 --> 01:09:16,308
Oh, shit.
Now what?

918
01:09:16,483 --> 01:09:18,542
There's nothing
but classical music on this thing.

919
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:21,381
I knew there was something wrong
with that guy.

920
01:09:21,555 --> 01:09:22,920
You sure
you know what you're doing?

921
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:25,058
Shut up
and keep walking.

922
01:09:31,999 --> 01:09:34,263
You know, the funny thing is...

923
01:09:34,869 --> 01:09:38,270
Lochlan and me,
we'd kind of broken up.

924
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:43,305
This camping trip was his idea
to get us back together.

925
01:09:44,311 --> 01:09:46,779
I hate camping.
He knew that.

926
01:09:46,947 --> 01:09:51,213
The woods are beautiful, I just-
I don't wanna sleep in them.

927
01:09:51,886 --> 01:09:53,717
I want room service.
Sure.

928
01:09:53,888 --> 01:09:56,584
Minibar.
Yeah.

929
01:10:00,594 --> 01:10:04,121
What do you do?
You know, back in the real world?

930
01:10:04,298 --> 01:10:05,959
I produce TV commercials.

931
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:08,463
That's great.

932
01:10:09,303 --> 01:10:12,067
You ever met an advertising man?

933
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:13,706
No.

934
01:10:14,041 --> 01:10:15,065
The worst.

935
01:10:15,242 --> 01:10:16,834
Yeah?

936
01:10:20,581 --> 01:10:23,209
I have no idea
how to use this thing, Ray.

937
01:10:24,518 --> 01:10:29,080
There's no safety on this. You
just point it and pull the trigger.

938
01:10:29,256 --> 01:10:30,746
Ray.

939
01:10:32,259 --> 01:10:33,248
Ray.

940
01:10:33,994 --> 01:10:36,121
They'll wait until dark.

941
01:10:36,297 --> 01:10:38,993
So I'm gonna make you
my final offer.

942
01:10:39,166 --> 01:10:41,794
Take these handcuffs off of me
and let me walk out of here

943
01:10:41,969 --> 01:10:43,869
before the shooting starts.

944
01:10:44,405 --> 01:10:46,498
Practice on him.

945
01:10:59,019 --> 01:11:00,919
It's getting dark
out here, chief.

946
01:11:01,922 --> 01:11:04,015
Give it awhile longer

947
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:05,590
and then bring it in.

948
01:11:05,759 --> 01:11:07,624
Roger that.

949
01:11:17,805 --> 01:11:19,568
You and your dad
do much camping?

950
01:11:20,341 --> 01:11:22,571
No, not really.

951
01:11:22,743 --> 01:11:24,870
Guess we're kind of...

952
01:11:27,281 --> 01:11:28,942
Kind of bonding.

953
01:11:30,417 --> 01:11:31,884
You don't say.

954
01:11:50,137 --> 01:11:51,434
Maybe you're wrong.

955
01:11:51,605 --> 01:11:53,596
No, they're there.

956
01:12:04,251 --> 01:12:06,685
Hey. Wait for my signal.

957
01:12:19,066 --> 01:12:21,967
Chris. Hey. Chris.

958
01:12:38,018 --> 01:12:39,451
We just want Carden.

959
01:12:40,654 --> 01:12:42,315
Frank, you in there?

960
01:12:42,856 --> 01:12:44,153
Yeah, I'm okay.

961
01:12:44,458 --> 01:12:47,450
Give us Carden,
we'll leave you alone.

962
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:04,809
Last chance.

963
01:13:06,513 --> 01:13:07,673
Give us Carden.

964
01:13:16,824 --> 01:13:18,519
If it's just you, Ray,

965
01:13:18,692 --> 01:13:20,489
hell, it's your choice.

966
01:13:20,994 --> 01:13:22,894
But it's your son.

967
01:13:23,063 --> 01:13:24,621
A woman.

968
01:13:26,667 --> 01:13:30,330
Look, you don't have to prove anything.
You've already done that.

969
01:13:30,671 --> 01:13:32,605
I'm convinced.

970
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:57,720
Be careful, son.

971
01:14:16,917 --> 01:14:18,077
No!

972
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:20,016
Royko.

973
01:14:34,067 --> 01:14:36,160
Royko. Royko.

974
01:14:40,174 --> 01:14:41,163
Let me see.

975
01:14:41,341 --> 01:14:42,865
Damn it.

976
01:14:46,446 --> 01:14:48,346
Get down! Now!

977
01:14:52,052 --> 01:14:53,883
Hey.

978
01:15:05,032 --> 01:15:06,260
Chris? Chris!

979
01:15:22,082 --> 01:15:23,549
CHRIS:
Dad?

980
01:15:28,422 --> 01:15:30,287
Dad. Dad!

981
01:15:34,328 --> 01:15:35,317
Put the gun down.

982
01:15:36,029 --> 01:15:38,998
Put it down. Come on.

983
01:15:41,702 --> 01:15:43,465
I'm taking the kid, Ray.
Dad.

984
01:15:43,637 --> 01:15:45,662
If you wanna see him alive,
don't come after me.

985
01:15:45,839 --> 01:15:46,897
Dad!
Coming out!

986
01:15:47,074 --> 01:15:48,803
Dad.

987
01:16:17,704 --> 01:16:19,228
All right, now listen.

988
01:16:19,406 --> 01:16:23,866
You try to call out in any way,
or run, I'm gonna snap your neck,

989
01:16:24,044 --> 01:16:25,102
you understand me?
Yeah.

990
01:16:25,279 --> 01:16:27,747
Don't confuse me with a nice guy.
Yes.

991
01:16:36,556 --> 01:16:40,458
No. You listen to me, this thing
has to stay outside the Beltway.

992
01:16:40,627 --> 01:16:43,528
If the White House got implicated-

993
01:16:43,697 --> 01:16:45,995
I said I'd handle it.

994
01:16:46,566 --> 01:16:49,694
I've been informed the president
will not change his plans.

995
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:50,859
They don't want panic.

996
01:16:51,038 --> 01:16:53,302
We're gonna have to move
all resources to protect him.

997
01:16:53,473 --> 01:16:56,271
But Carden's hardly likely
to make the attempt now.

998
01:16:56,443 --> 01:16:59,241
He's lost his backup team for starter-
He's got a contract,

999
01:16:59,413 --> 01:17:01,540
he'll try to fulfill it,
that's what he's like.

1000
01:17:01,715 --> 01:17:05,742
How do you know that?
We've had dealings with him.

1001
01:17:07,154 --> 01:17:08,985
What about the boy?
What boy?

1002
01:17:09,156 --> 01:17:11,181
The boy he took with him.
Chris... something.

1003
01:17:11,358 --> 01:17:14,418
Main thing is to protect the president.
This is Mr. Keene.

1004
01:17:14,594 --> 01:17:15,959
I'm sorry?
Ray Keene.

1005
01:17:16,129 --> 01:17:18,791
Ray Keene. His son was taken hostage.

1006
01:17:18,965 --> 01:17:20,057
Of course.

1007
01:17:21,234 --> 01:17:22,633
What are you doing
about my son?

1008
01:17:22,803 --> 01:17:24,100
We're looking for your son.

1009
01:17:24,271 --> 01:17:27,468
We are doing everything
we can, rest assured.

1010
01:17:27,641 --> 01:17:30,474
I know how difficult
this is for you.

1011
01:17:45,959 --> 01:17:48,052
Son? You okay?

1012
01:17:48,228 --> 01:17:50,355
Is everything all right?

1013
01:17:55,302 --> 01:17:58,396
You know, Ray,
we're gonna do everything we can.

1014
01:17:59,373 --> 01:18:03,275
But most of my men are diverted
to the president in Woodburn.

1015
01:18:03,443 --> 01:18:05,377
But after that...

1016
01:18:17,591 --> 01:18:19,718
MILES I can't believe
you screwed up again.

1017
01:18:19,893 --> 01:18:22,487
Look, I need Carden gone.

1018
01:18:22,662 --> 01:18:25,597
I don't want him back in Washington.
I don't want him talking to anyone.

1019
01:18:25,766 --> 01:18:26,858
I hear you.

1020
01:18:27,033 --> 01:18:29,797
And if the boy's alive,

1021
01:18:30,303 --> 01:18:32,567
make it look like Carden killed him.

1022
01:18:32,739 --> 01:18:35,401
The boy's father, Ray Keene,

1023
01:18:35,575 --> 01:18:37,406
God knows what Carden told him.

1024
01:18:37,577 --> 01:18:39,807
Isn't he an old pro?
He'd tell him nothing.

1025
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:41,345
Can't risk it.

1026
01:18:41,515 --> 01:18:42,948
Erase everything.

1027
01:18:43,116 --> 01:18:45,277
And Davis, don't let me down.

1028
01:18:45,452 --> 01:18:47,215
Hey, what do you look like?

1029
01:18:47,387 --> 01:18:50,288
I'm only asking because it sounds
like you're pretty hot.

1030
01:18:50,457 --> 01:18:52,322
Bet you got a great tush.

1031
01:18:52,793 --> 01:18:54,055
Ugh.

1032
01:19:15,282 --> 01:19:18,012
I can't believe she went
back to Washington.

1033
01:19:18,185 --> 01:19:20,517
With Miles,
you just never know.

1034
01:19:20,687 --> 01:19:22,848
I guess she figures
she's done all she can.

1035
01:19:23,023 --> 01:19:25,958
It's not every day the president
visits this part of the country,

1036
01:19:26,126 --> 01:19:29,562
and just about anyone who's
anyone local will be here today.

1037
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:31,258
The president is bound
to come under fire

1038
01:19:31,798 --> 01:19:35,131
for cutbacks his administration
has made to the education budget.

1039
01:19:35,302 --> 01:19:38,135
Be interesting to see how he handles
that one at the press conference.

1040
01:19:38,305 --> 01:19:39,772
Back to you, Bob.

1041
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:41,305
Thanks, Dana.

1042
01:19:41,475 --> 01:19:43,602
In other local news,
Lydel Hammond, Sr.,

1043
01:19:43,777 --> 01:19:45,210
the reclusive billionaire,

1044
01:19:45,378 --> 01:19:49,075
will be attending the funeral of his son
in Cedar Pine this afternoon.

1045
01:19:49,249 --> 01:19:51,149
Hammond Senior's
outspoken criticism

1046
01:19:51,318 --> 01:19:53,513
of government
stem-cell research programs

1047
01:19:53,687 --> 01:19:57,054
has caused him to be labeled
by a White House spokesperson:

1048
01:19:57,224 --> 01:19:59,590
an obstacle to progress.

1049
01:19:59,759 --> 01:20:02,626
Hammond Jr. was killed last week
in a tragic accident

1050
01:20:02,796 --> 01:20:05,560
outside an apartment building
in Cedar Pine.

1051
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,868
Yep, Deputy Evans.

1052
01:20:11,171 --> 01:20:12,433
Okay.

1053
01:20:13,173 --> 01:20:14,470
Give me a minute.

1054
01:20:14,641 --> 01:20:16,973
Let me see if I can find him.

1055
01:20:19,145 --> 01:20:20,237
Excuse me, Father.

1056
01:20:20,413 --> 01:20:22,973
Just a minute.
Yeah, what's up?

1057
01:20:23,149 --> 01:20:24,946
Ray Keene's on the phone.
Yeah?

1058
01:20:25,118 --> 01:20:28,349
Says the president's not the
target at all, wants to talk to you.

1059
01:20:28,522 --> 01:20:30,922
Oh, come on, no. He's
just beat and upset.

1060
01:20:31,091 --> 01:20:33,184
Just tell him you
couldn't find me.

1061
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:37,387
"The president's not the target"? Jesus.

1062
01:20:38,265 --> 01:20:39,926
Hey, Ray.
Sorry, Father.

1063
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:43,263
I can't locate him right at the
moment. Let me call you back.

1064
01:22:28,141 --> 01:22:30,041
Carden.

1065
01:22:42,789 --> 01:22:45,314
You just won't let a man get
on with his work, will you?

1066
01:22:45,492 --> 01:22:46,618
RAy:
Where's Chris?

1067
01:22:46,793 --> 01:22:48,761
I'm busy. I've got a job to do.

1068
01:22:48,928 --> 01:22:50,486
After, we can talk.
Where's my son?

1069
01:22:52,799 --> 01:22:53,993
Son of a...

1070
01:22:55,735 --> 01:22:56,793
What was that?

1071
01:22:56,970 --> 01:22:59,666
Somebody shooting.
At me?

1072
01:23:00,173 --> 01:23:01,231
No, me.

1073
01:23:04,911 --> 01:23:05,900
Is it the police?

1074
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:09,048
I think it's my friend.
Your friend.

1075
01:23:09,215 --> 01:23:10,580
Well, more of
an acquaintance.

1076
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:12,581
Keep your head down.

1077
01:23:12,986 --> 01:23:17,650
Jesus said to her,
"I am the resurrection and the life.

1078
01:23:17,824 --> 01:23:21,089
He who believes in me will live
even though he dies.

1079
01:23:21,995 --> 01:23:26,056
And whoever lives and believes in me
will never die.

1080
01:23:26,232 --> 01:23:28,427
Do you believe this?"

1081
01:23:28,968 --> 01:23:30,765
"Do you believe this?"

1082
01:23:30,937 --> 01:23:34,202
This is not a rhetorical question
that Jesus asked.

1083
01:23:35,075 --> 01:23:38,442
These words are just as relevant
in the present day

1084
01:23:38,611 --> 01:23:40,875
as they were to Lazarus.

1085
01:23:42,882 --> 01:23:48,081
Why? Where is the hope,
come from God in despair?

1086
01:24:03,236 --> 01:24:06,672
Rather, the hope is in the one
who performed the miracle.

1087
01:24:07,607 --> 01:24:10,007
It is found in Jesus himself.

1088
01:24:10,176 --> 01:24:13,043
"I am the resurrection and the life. "

1089
01:24:15,115 --> 01:24:18,778
This occasion served to show
that those who believe in him

1090
01:24:18,952 --> 01:24:20,920
need not fear the grave.

1091
01:24:21,087 --> 01:24:22,247
He holds the power-

1092
01:24:22,422 --> 01:24:23,821
Hey, smartass?

1093
01:24:31,264 --> 01:24:34,927
"He who believes in me will live,
even though he dies. "

1094
01:24:46,012 --> 01:24:47,912
It's just so tragic.

1095
01:25:17,343 --> 01:25:20,676
I had a perfect record
until today.

1096
01:25:21,347 --> 01:25:22,974
Where is my son, Frank?

1097
01:25:23,683 --> 01:25:25,776
I know you didn't hurt him.

1098
01:25:25,952 --> 01:25:28,318
Oh, you do, do you?
Yeah.

1099
01:25:28,922 --> 01:25:31,322
Where's my son?

1100
01:26:05,425 --> 01:26:07,393
Chris?

1101
01:26:08,361 --> 01:26:10,022
Alright, you ready?
On three.

1102
01:26:10,396 --> 01:26:11,522
Sorry.

1103
01:26:11,698 --> 01:26:14,258
You all right?
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1104
01:26:15,101 --> 01:26:16,625
It was really boring, though.

1105
01:26:16,803 --> 01:26:18,862
He put the TV
on the business channel.

1106
01:26:20,406 --> 01:26:22,533
All right. All right.

1107
01:26:22,709 --> 01:26:24,574
All right.

1108
01:26:49,469 --> 01:26:51,369
Hi, can I help you?
Can I get a double latte?

1109
01:26:51,537 --> 01:26:53,562
And your name, please.

1110
01:26:56,943 --> 01:27:00,310
Gwen? Non-fat decaf latte.

1111
01:27:08,154 --> 01:27:09,587
Excuse me.

1112
01:27:09,756 --> 01:27:11,348
Is this yours?

1113
01:27:13,526 --> 01:27:15,426
By the way,

1114
01:27:15,595 --> 01:27:18,393
if anything happens
to Ray Keene or his son,

1115
01:27:18,564 --> 01:27:20,896
I'll be coming after you.

1116
01:27:21,334 --> 01:27:22,824
Depend on it.

1117
01:27:49,028 --> 01:27:50,757
The unsung hero
in this amazing case

1118
01:27:50,930 --> 01:27:53,125
is our own local police chief,
Ed Wainwright.

1119
01:27:53,299 --> 01:27:56,427
Tell me, how did you know where
young Chris Keene was being held?

1120
01:27:56,602 --> 01:28:00,402
Well, I'm not at liberty to disclose
the sources of my information,

1121
01:28:00,573 --> 01:28:04,168
but when you've been in charge
for as long as I have

1122
01:28:04,344 --> 01:28:07,609
you build up connections in town
and earn the trust...

1123
01:28:09,248 --> 01:28:10,374
of people of the community.

1124
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:12,950
And I hear you're up for another
promotion, is that correct?

1125
01:28:13,119 --> 01:28:16,782
Well, I am, but I'm thinking
about running for mayor next year.

1126
01:28:16,956 --> 01:28:19,686
Well, congratulations.
That's excellent.

1127
01:28:20,293 --> 01:28:22,158
Keep going.

1128
01:28:25,365 --> 01:28:28,493
Here we are.
Thanks.

1129
01:28:28,668 --> 01:28:31,796
You guys okay?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You?

1130
01:28:32,205 --> 01:28:34,002
Yeah.

1131
01:28:34,707 --> 01:28:36,937
Thanks for inviting me.
RAy: Oh, sure.

1132
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:39,908
Barbecue's about as close to
camping as I ever wanna get.

1133
01:28:40,079 --> 01:28:41,569
I second that motion.

1134
01:28:41,748 --> 01:28:43,477
He only invited you
because he can't cook.

1135
01:28:43,649 --> 01:28:45,742
Now, you can't tell her that,
it's a family secret.

1136
01:28:45,918 --> 01:28:48,182
Well, I figured it couldn't be
for any other reason.

1137
01:28:51,758 --> 01:28:54,659
I'm gonna get you a plate.
Okay? Hold on.

1138
01:28:55,328 --> 01:28:56,818
Thanks.

1139
01:29:02,568 --> 01:29:05,799
MAN
WKGB-104. This is the news at 2.

1140
01:29:05,972 --> 01:29:08,964
The death has been reported
of billionaire, Lydel Hammond,

1141
01:29:09,142 --> 01:29:12,236
in a tragic boating accident
while on holiday at Whidbey Island.

1142
01:29:12,412 --> 01:29:14,505
Coincidentally, Hammond's son,
Lydel Jr.,

1143
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:17,808
died in a hit-and-run accident
less than two weeks ago.

1144
01:29:17,984 --> 01:29:19,884
Hammond Senior
was a controversial figure,

1145
01:29:20,053 --> 01:29:22,749
whose views on many issues
were considered extreme,

1146
01:29:22,922 --> 01:29:26,255
though he always denied
the alleged links with violent factions.

1147
01:29:26,426 --> 01:29:29,862
The administration, however, has
taken steps to distance themselves...

1147
01:29:30,305 --> 01:30:30,233
