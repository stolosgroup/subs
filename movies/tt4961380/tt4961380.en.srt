00:02:05,336 --> 00:02:08,550
- Hello.
- <i>Hey, it's me. I'm outside.</i>

3
00:02:10,324 --> 00:02:11,987
Alright.

4
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:22,364
Daddy's little princess.

5
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,487
So...

6
00:02:30,787 --> 00:02:32,764
...you want me to get in close?

7
00:02:32,864 --> 00:02:35,567
Look for a way in?
Maybe check for an alarm system?

8
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:38,080
No, don't worry, they have an alarm system.

9
00:02:38,402 --> 00:02:40,382
Don't worry?

10
00:02:41,138 --> 00:02:43,875
Ade, trust me.

11
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:47,022
It gets a lot worse
than just a fuckin' alarm system.

12
00:03:02,193 --> 00:03:06,084
This needs to be surgical. No mistakes.
We gotta cover all the angles.

13
00:03:06,184 --> 00:03:08,633
It's gonna take time to plan this.

14
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:11,970
Six weeks, that's what we've got.

15
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,907
- You can't rush this.
- We got six weeks or this doesn't happen.

16
00:03:16,007 --> 00:03:19,078
If you can't do it, tell us now
so I can find someone who can.

17
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:23,336
All I'm saying... is that I've been
doin' this for long enough...

18
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:28,286
...to know that there are only two outcomes
to this little situation of ours.

19
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:31,857
One is where we plan this properly.

20
00:03:32,657 --> 00:03:35,260
The second is where we don't get caught.

21
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,730
Look, none of us are here
because we wanna be.

22
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,534
Okay, this is the last chance
we're gonna get at a normal fuckin' life.

23
00:03:42,634 --> 00:03:46,281
We've taken things this far because
we all understand the risks involved.

24
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:49,808
They're completely predictable.

25
00:03:49,908 --> 00:03:53,511
Yeah, that's the first mistake.
We can't assume anything on this job.

26
00:03:53,611 --> 00:03:55,434
He's got access to diamonds.

27
00:03:56,414 --> 00:03:57,779
A lot of diamonds.

28
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:01,686
Owns a chain of distributors.
Has access to all the safes all the time.

29
00:04:01,786 --> 00:04:04,055
Expect the unexpected, that's all I'm saying.

30
00:04:04,155 --> 00:04:07,325
Coming from a guy
that's been in prison twice.

31
00:04:07,425 --> 00:04:09,681
Third time, they throw away the key.
You know that, don't you?

32
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:12,063
Yeah, we're gonna learn from your mistakes.

33
00:04:12,163 --> 00:04:14,199
That's why we're cousins.

34
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:18,503
Yeah, that's a zippy new hairdo
you got there, Goldilocks.

35
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:22,651
You hiding from someone?
Are you running away from something?

36
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:26,575
Sometimes, all you can do is run, Mark.

37
00:04:26,945 --> 00:04:29,414
I think we can all agree on one thing.

38
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:31,927
The sooner we get this over with, the better.

39
00:04:35,586 --> 00:04:37,889
This thing has to go down without a glitch.

40
00:04:37,989 --> 00:04:40,519
It needs to tick-tick like a Swiss watch.

41
00:05:03,097 --> 00:05:04,579
You boys all good?

42
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:08,603
Apart from freezing my balls off,
I'm just peachy.

43
00:05:09,553 --> 00:05:11,327
You have balls, James?

44
00:05:14,187 --> 00:05:16,004
Turn right here.

45
00:05:42,753 --> 00:05:45,043
Hey, protection only.

46
00:05:45,323 --> 00:05:47,789
Yeah, for protection only.

47
00:05:51,595 --> 00:05:54,015
Ade, take the front. James, take the back.

48
00:05:54,315 --> 00:05:56,074
Yeah, got it.

49
00:05:57,201 --> 00:05:59,514
- Okay, you ready?
- Yup.

50
00:06:01,805 --> 00:06:03,275
Yeah.

51
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:06,081
Let's do this.

52
00:06:56,994 --> 00:06:58,515
That's...

53
00:06:59,106 --> 00:07:00,688
...interesting.

54
00:09:14,164 --> 00:09:16,177
What the fuck?

55
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:45,607
That's right.

56
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,711
Do what I say and I won't hurt you.

57
00:09:59,075 --> 00:10:00,955
Go, go!

58
00:10:05,816 --> 00:10:08,296
Ade, lock this bitch down!

59
00:11:45,382 --> 00:11:46,962
Perfect.

60
00:12:20,183 --> 00:12:22,597
Who's there?

61
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:06,330
Remind me to scrap the we'll return-your-
daughter-unharmed part of the ransom video.

62
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,033
- What the fuck's going on here?
- We didn't do this.

63
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:12,103
- Stick to the plan, no matter what.
- Something's not right.

64
00:13:12,203 --> 00:13:15,851
- Looks like we rescued her from that house.
- Stick to the plan.

65
00:13:30,503 --> 00:13:33,134
Drink up. We have a busy night.

66
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:37,338
Fuckers.

67
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:40,315
What did you say?

68
00:13:40,765 --> 00:13:44,613
You should really let me go.
It'll be better for all of you.

69
00:13:54,176 --> 00:13:57,515
Please. Please just let me go.
I haven't seen your faces.

70
00:13:57,615 --> 00:14:00,661
I don't know how many
of you there are. Please.

71
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,534
This may be the last footage
anyone ever sees of you.

72
00:14:06,823 --> 00:14:08,206
Make it matter.

73
00:14:53,002 --> 00:14:54,849
Fucking wiring.

74
00:14:58,241 --> 00:14:59,847
Mr. and Mrs. Hudson, good evening...

75
00:14:59,947 --> 00:15:02,640
It's a sick joke, Mom! Don't believe them!

76
00:15:04,348 --> 00:15:08,258
You know the rules here.
The quicker we get this done...

77
00:15:08,358 --> 00:15:10,231
...the quicker you go home.

78
00:15:14,357 --> 00:15:16,120
Take two.

79
00:15:17,427 --> 00:15:19,817
Mr. and Mrs. Hudson, we have your daughter...

80
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:22,066
Don't pay them, Daddy!
They're in over their heads.

81
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:25,998
Hey, hey, stop. I got this. Leave it.

82
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:31,525
Hey.

83
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,438
You wanna know a secret?

84
00:15:35,712 --> 00:15:38,945
You're gonna make it
out of this unharmed. Okay?

85
00:15:39,045 --> 00:15:40,595
This...

86
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,920
...it's all for show.

87
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,299
The last thing we wanna do is hurt you.

88
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:49,594
Now I know you love your dad very much.

89
00:15:49,694 --> 00:15:53,741
He's done bad things to some people.
Taken things that don't belong to him.

90
00:15:56,966 --> 00:15:58,779
Now your daddy's rich.

91
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:02,907
What we're taking,
he'll make up very quickly.

92
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:05,677
This is just what we have to do
to get the money.

93
00:16:06,307 --> 00:16:10,134
It'll all be over
very, very quick if you behave.

94
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:16,097
Rehearsal's over, okay?

95
00:16:18,154 --> 00:16:19,867
Okay?

96
00:16:20,723 --> 00:16:22,237
Okay.

97
00:16:25,261 --> 00:16:28,866
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Hudson, here is your daughter.</i>

98
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:31,802
<i>She's having a really bad night.</i>

99
00:16:31,902 --> 00:16:36,540
<i>We want the 300 carats of diamonds
you keep in your various premises.</i>

100
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,917
<i>This is a time-sensitive matter for us.</i>

101
00:16:40,176 --> 00:16:42,300
<i>Mom, Dad, please do what they say.</i>

102
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,316
<i>Give them the diamonds, please!
I wanna come home!</i>

103
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,729
<i>I wanna come home, please!</i>

104
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:51,866
Send it. I'll make the call.

105
00:17:05,585 --> 00:17:08,443
- No one's answering.
- Try again.

106
00:17:23,853 --> 00:17:26,501
- <i>The number you have reached is not...</i>
- Shit.

107
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:29,011
Try their cell phones.

108
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:49,156
- You're certain these are the right numbers?
- Yeah, I checked them over and over.

109
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,250
- Fuck!
- You wanna wait it out?

110
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,754
Because you're the one who said
this thing needed to be slick, quiet...

111
00:17:56,854 --> 00:17:59,570
- ...and most importantly, fast!
- I know what I fucking said!

112
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,938
- Haze, you need to stay calm.
- This is me calm.

113
00:18:23,513 --> 00:18:26,029
- You guys need to go back to the house.
- No.

114
00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:30,271
No? That's it? You wanna bring
somethin' else to the table here?

115
00:18:30,371 --> 00:18:33,891
- That's not the plan.
- Yeah, it is the plan.

116
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:36,140
It's called plan B.

117
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:40,664
What if it's a trap?

118
00:18:40,764 --> 00:18:43,334
They don't know what they're tryin' to trap.

119
00:18:43,434 --> 00:18:45,503
We haven't made contact yet!

120
00:18:45,603 --> 00:18:50,341
There's no way they've watched the video and
gone to the cops in the last three minutes.

121
00:18:50,441 --> 00:18:54,512
We can't babysit this girl for days. People
are gonna know that I'm up to something.

122
00:18:54,612 --> 00:18:57,681
I've got a court date in three days and
I need to be out of the fucking country.

123
00:18:57,781 --> 00:19:01,138
I need to be in Panama. This deal
needs to go down like we planned.

124
00:19:01,238 --> 00:19:03,481
Then you fuckin' go.

125
00:19:11,577 --> 00:19:13,591
I'm with you, cuz.

126
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:21,152
Just scope it out. Stay in touch.

127
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,433
You hear anything, you let us know.

128
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:31,359
Yeah, I gotcha.

129
00:19:33,132 --> 00:19:34,712
Hey.

130
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:40,034
You be careful, okay?

131
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:42,270
Yeah.

132
00:20:08,885 --> 00:20:12,266
The wiring in this place is fucked up.

133
00:20:13,923 --> 00:20:16,804
Just go. No one's afraid of the dark.

134
00:20:18,761 --> 00:20:20,655
Maybe you should be.

135
00:20:46,906 --> 00:20:49,810
It's just a power trip.
I don't think the system's fried.

136
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,779
How brave are you feelin'?

137
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:53,731
I'm not.

138
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:56,467
Look, getting the scanner up
and running is top priority.

139
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:59,847
I need you to check the breaker switch
while I reboot the system.

140
00:21:03,272 --> 00:21:05,175
Remember that foster home we had?

141
00:21:05,275 --> 00:21:07,378
The ones that never paid their electric bill?

142
00:21:07,478 --> 00:21:10,080
- Yeah.
- Well, it's just like that.

143
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,743
The switch is in the basement though.

144
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:16,781
Of course, it is.

145
00:21:22,692 --> 00:21:26,463
It'd be great if those two could do
some of the dirty work every now and then.

146
00:21:26,563 --> 00:21:28,926
Yeah, man, this is a fuck-up!

147
00:21:34,036 --> 00:21:37,117
Keep your eyes on the road.

148
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:41,889
Let's at least try not to kill
another family member.

149
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:44,992
Nice.

150
00:22:38,735 --> 00:22:40,572
That's a good girl.

151
00:22:41,372 --> 00:22:43,184
You just stay there.

152
00:23:47,687 --> 00:23:49,700
You should really let me go.

153
00:23:51,107 --> 00:23:53,387
Or you're all gonna die tonight.

154
00:24:31,407 --> 00:24:33,227
Your dad's smart.

155
00:24:33,749 --> 00:24:35,763
He'll get you out of this.

156
00:24:50,571 --> 00:24:55,217
<i>At night he comes in my dreams</i>

157
00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:00,748
<i>Darkest night with taunting screams</i>

158
00:25:01,288 --> 00:25:05,957
<i>I try to keep my eyes awake</i>

159
00:25:06,657 --> 00:25:11,352
<i>My soul is not his to take</i>

160
00:25:12,018 --> 00:25:16,703
<i>But he comes and won't let me dream</i>

161
00:25:17,157 --> 00:25:21,591
<i>All I do is scream and scream</i>

162
00:25:25,568 --> 00:25:27,581
How do you know that song?

163
00:25:29,505 --> 00:25:31,975
I used to sing that when I was a kid.

164
00:25:32,075 --> 00:25:34,088
That's not all I know.

165
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,101
I also know why you kidnapped me.

166
00:25:37,514 --> 00:25:39,527
Why you chose me.

167
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,230
But it's not gonna bring them back.

168
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,920
I know that your parents died in that fire.

169
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,457
- You shut up.
- And that you feel responsible.

170
00:25:50,557 --> 00:25:54,608
Responsible because you lived and they died.

171
00:25:59,835 --> 00:26:04,284
Don't you think for a second
that I can't become the bad guy.

172
00:26:04,974 --> 00:26:08,989
For the right reasons I'll become
your worst fuckin' nightmare.

173
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:16,690
Hello?

174
00:27:56,535 --> 00:27:58,122
This place stinks.

175
00:27:59,188 --> 00:28:01,201
You smell that before?

176
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,137
No.

177
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:15,949
Same as before. We find the parents
and get to the bottom of this.

178
00:29:08,057 --> 00:29:10,060
Sneaky fuckers.

179
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:14,875
You think you're safe
by hidin' in the basement.

180
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:37,905
We've got your daughter.

181
00:29:46,295 --> 00:29:49,175
<i>Why our little girl? Why this house?</i>

182
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,599
<i>Why our little girl? Why this house?</i>

183
00:29:55,821 --> 00:29:58,635
<i>Why our little girl? Why this house?</i>

184
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:03,233
<i>Why our little girl? Why this house?</i>

185
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,161
<i>Why our little girl? Why this house?</i>

186
00:30:09,818 --> 00:30:11,632
<i>Why our little girl...</i>

187
00:30:47,589 --> 00:30:49,159
Fuck!

188
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:51,952
Oh, my God! What the fuck!

189
00:30:55,697 --> 00:30:57,277
Fuck!

190
00:31:01,703 --> 00:31:03,217
James?

191
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:40,454
Cuz, is that you?

192
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:35,775
Oh, thank God.

193
00:33:12,068 --> 00:33:15,402
- Ade! Are you okay? What happened?
- I fuckin' saw Georgie.

194
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,705
- That's impossible. George is dead!
- You think I'd make this shit up?

195
00:33:18,805 --> 00:33:21,845
It's this place. It's this place,
it's fucked! It's completely fucked!

196
00:33:21,945 --> 00:33:23,947
The parents, her parents are dead.

197
00:33:24,047 --> 00:33:26,509
Yeah, and there are two
more dead bodies downstairs!

198
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:31,254
Their... their chests were ripped or torn
or somethin'. Jesus, fuck, it's a mess!

199
00:33:31,354 --> 00:33:34,324
Oh, shit. Oh, shit,
we're gonna get blamed for this.

200
00:33:34,424 --> 00:33:37,093
No, the fucking cops are gonna
think that we did this!

201
00:33:37,193 --> 00:33:40,006
That we broke into the house and we did this!

202
00:33:42,131 --> 00:33:46,212
- We need to get outta here. Now!
- Okay, okay, okay. Let's go!

203
00:33:46,705 --> 00:33:48,515
Come on.

204
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,720
Ade, get up!

205
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:57,457
Come on!

206
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:08,124
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

207
00:34:08,224 --> 00:34:10,103
Easy, man!

208
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,073
Shit!

209
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:20,780
What the fuck?

210
00:35:04,947 --> 00:35:07,227
What the fuck?

211
00:35:46,955 --> 00:35:48,269
Sarah?

212
00:36:13,415 --> 00:36:14,881
Daddy?

213
00:36:21,523 --> 00:36:24,137
Jesus. What the fuck?

214
00:36:50,352 --> 00:36:53,399
Ade. Ade.

215
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,539
Cuz?

216
00:37:05,734 --> 00:37:08,815
I'm gonna get help, cuz.
I'm gonna go get help.

217
00:37:09,204 --> 00:37:11,218
I'm gonna get help, cuz.

218
00:38:10,832 --> 00:38:12,601
James.

219
00:38:12,701 --> 00:38:14,280
James!

220
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,983
Oh, fuck.

221
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:21,688
James!

222
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:33,933
James!

223
00:38:42,998 --> 00:38:44,678
James!

224
00:38:49,804 --> 00:38:54,054
Come on. Come on, get it together. Come on.

225
00:40:03,645 --> 00:40:05,192
Mark?

226
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:08,807
Mark?

227
00:40:12,854 --> 00:40:14,359
Mark?

228
00:40:26,701 --> 00:40:28,214
Mark?

229
00:40:49,424 --> 00:40:51,004
Mark?

230
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,594
Mark!

231
00:41:58,694 --> 00:42:00,306
Ade!

232
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:30,303
<i>Hazel.</i>

233
00:42:31,292 --> 00:42:32,806
Mom?

234
00:42:34,996 --> 00:42:37,077
<i>Come to me, Hazel.</i>

235
00:42:58,754 --> 00:43:01,677
- Where the hell have you been?
- I heard something.

236
00:43:01,777 --> 00:43:04,761
- What do you mean you heard something?
- I saw Sarah.

237
00:43:05,661 --> 00:43:08,864
- What?
- I know you think I'm fuckin' crazy.

238
00:43:08,964 --> 00:43:11,410
No, no, no. No.

239
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,382
That's what scares me.

240
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,442
James!

241
00:43:19,542 --> 00:43:22,822
Dude, what the fuck are you doing?
Come on, we gotta get back. Hey.

242
00:43:23,678 --> 00:43:26,949
Ade, I saw my mom.

243
00:43:27,049 --> 00:43:28,551
She came back.

244
00:43:28,651 --> 00:43:31,487
She came back to fuck me up even more.

245
00:43:31,587 --> 00:43:35,124
Hey, listen to me. Alright, your mom
died five fuckin' years ago, okay?

246
00:43:35,224 --> 00:43:37,637
That bitch is in hell. Now come on!

247
00:43:49,521 --> 00:43:51,217
Fuck!

248
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,220
Hazel!

249
00:43:58,313 --> 00:44:00,193
What happened?

250
00:44:24,806 --> 00:44:26,575
Is he gonna be okay?

251
00:44:26,675 --> 00:44:30,312
It's not like we can rush him to a hospital.
Could this be some kind of a reaction?

252
00:44:30,412 --> 00:44:34,016
Reaction? Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

253
00:44:34,216 --> 00:44:37,864
Did he tell you what he saw in the woods?
Did he tell you he saw his dead mother?

254
00:44:40,521 --> 00:44:42,955
There's something very wrong
with that house on Willow Street.

255
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,544
What are you getting at?

256
00:44:45,444 --> 00:44:47,537
I'm fucking losing my mind.

257
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:51,967
What did you see, Ade?
What did you see at the house?

258
00:44:52,067 --> 00:44:55,571
- Did you find the parents?
- Oh, yeah. I found them, alright.

259
00:44:55,671 --> 00:44:58,107
- Good.
- Dead.

260
00:44:58,207 --> 00:44:59,852
Dead?

261
00:45:00,975 --> 00:45:03,245
Sorry, is there a fucking echo in here?

262
00:45:03,345 --> 00:45:05,625
So we're not getting the diamonds.

263
00:45:07,682 --> 00:45:10,786
No, all this means is
that the game's changed.

264
00:45:10,886 --> 00:45:13,822
Changed? No. No, no, no.
You don't fucking get it.

265
00:45:13,922 --> 00:45:17,246
Alright, there's no game anymore!
This is now Survival 101, alright?

266
00:45:17,346 --> 00:45:20,546
I don't care about the score.
It's not about the fucking jail time.

267
00:45:20,646 --> 00:45:23,049
This is life or death.

268
00:45:23,149 --> 00:45:25,017
Get it?

269
00:45:25,267 --> 00:45:28,721
Something fucking wrong happened in
that house and we brought it back here.

270
00:45:29,305 --> 00:45:31,741
And locked it in the fucking basement.

271
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:34,654
Are you saying that she killed them?

272
00:45:37,512 --> 00:45:39,726
They weren't the only bodies we found.

273
00:45:41,416 --> 00:45:43,930
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

274
00:45:45,687 --> 00:45:49,556
James said he found priests
in the basement for an exorcism.

275
00:45:52,126 --> 00:45:56,927
Like fucking human pin cushions,
there were garden tools sticking out of them.

276
00:45:58,766 --> 00:46:02,772
So to answer your question,
I don't fucking know if she killed them.

277
00:46:03,622 --> 00:46:07,626
But I do know she survived a hell of a lot
longer in that house than anyone else.

278
00:46:09,777 --> 00:46:11,991
Okay, so what the hell happened?

279
00:46:15,817 --> 00:46:17,630
Let's find out.

280
00:46:23,458 --> 00:46:27,874
So whatever's on this tape, we need to
stick together, find a way out of this, okay?

281
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:30,843
It's not gonna change anything.

282
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,445
Play it.

283
00:46:49,017 --> 00:46:52,498
I think I messed up big time.

284
00:46:53,821 --> 00:46:56,074
<i>I found this...</i>

285
00:46:56,754 --> 00:46:59,235
<i>...this sign in the basement.</i>

286
00:47:03,865 --> 00:47:06,636
<i>It turns out that this house has a...</i>

287
00:47:07,036 --> 00:47:11,851
...a strange history of deaths
dating back to the early 1900s.

288
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,678
There was even a church
investigation in the 1920s.

289
00:47:16,078 --> 00:47:17,946
In 1941...

290
00:47:18,046 --> 00:47:22,312
...Mary Ellison and her grandson, Bradley
moved into the Willow Street house.

291
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:27,466
Two weeks later, she kills him...

292
00:47:28,356 --> 00:47:32,038
...by taking a cheese grater to his throat
while giving him a bath.

293
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:37,433
Don and Sam Forbes move in
with their two kids in the 1960s.

294
00:47:37,533 --> 00:47:40,536
He comes home one night
after visiting his mistress...

295
00:47:40,636 --> 00:47:44,400
...to find his wife gauging out her eyeballs.

296
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,731
Their two kids peacefully in bed
poisoned with drain cleaner.

297
00:47:49,011 --> 00:47:53,782
<i>The next notable case is Mary
and John Davies and their kid, Hazel.</i>

298
00:47:53,882 --> 00:47:55,961
<i>There's no remaining photos.</i>

299
00:47:56,784 --> 00:48:00,266
John Davies was my father's business partner.

300
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,793
A fire rips through the house...

301
00:48:04,393 --> 00:48:06,696
...killing everyone except Hazel.

302
00:48:07,828 --> 00:48:10,656
<i>Sounds nuts, right? Just wait.</i>

303
00:48:12,633 --> 00:48:16,038
- Wait, what the hell?
- You lived in that house?

304
00:48:16,138 --> 00:48:18,907
Jesus Christ. That's how
you knew about the diamonds.

305
00:48:19,007 --> 00:48:22,061
After my parents died, Katherine's dad
took over the diamond business.

306
00:48:22,161 --> 00:48:26,065
Moved into that house, my house
and before I knew it, I was on welfare.

307
00:48:26,165 --> 00:48:28,901
- That's the story. Let's move on.
- So this is personal.

308
00:48:29,001 --> 00:48:33,322
It doesn't matter how they were chosen.
They fitted what we were looking for.

309
00:48:33,422 --> 00:48:37,092
Isolated house, single daughter, wealth.
These are parameters that you came up with.

310
00:48:37,192 --> 00:48:40,462
- Then why didn't you tell us?
- I did. I told you I knew about the house.

311
00:48:40,562 --> 00:48:44,444
Everything else is irrelevant.
Now please, keep playing the tape.

312
00:48:48,302 --> 00:48:52,518
<i>Mary Ellison lost her son,
Bradley's father in the first World War.</i>

313
00:48:53,834 --> 00:48:58,614
Don Forbes was grieving the loss
of their third and youngest son Carl.

314
00:48:59,314 --> 00:49:01,750
John Davies moved here with his family...

315
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:04,897
...after his brother
was killed in a diamond heist.

316
00:49:06,888 --> 00:49:08,857
I know this sounds crazy...

317
00:49:08,957 --> 00:49:12,065
...but if you're watching this,
I need you to believe me.

318
00:49:15,129 --> 00:49:18,601
<i>If you move into this house
and you're grieving...</i>

319
00:49:19,401 --> 00:49:21,681
<i>...you're in for a pretty bad time.</i>

320
00:49:25,673 --> 00:49:27,887
The curse of Tranguul.

321
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:32,224
Devourer of tormented souls.

322
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:40,800
So what's tormenting me?

323
00:49:44,425 --> 00:49:47,039
I had this taken out of me three weeks ago.

324
00:49:50,598 --> 00:49:53,045
I haven't told anybody. Nobody knows.

325
00:49:54,903 --> 00:49:57,373
<i>Katherine, are you okay in there?</i>

326
00:49:58,173 --> 00:50:02,188
So this happened in the last six weeks.
Completely predictable?

327
00:50:03,678 --> 00:50:05,658
What else is there?

328
00:50:09,517 --> 00:50:13,455
<i>I wish I could... I wish I could
tell you what it sounds like.</i>

329
00:50:13,555 --> 00:50:16,128
<i>You know when you... when you
think a thought in your head...</i>

330
00:50:16,228 --> 00:50:18,560
<i>...and you hear your own voice?</i>

331
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:22,899
<i>Well, I'm not hearing
my own voice anymore. It's...</i>

332
00:50:22,999 --> 00:50:25,034
<i>...it's something else.</i>

333
00:50:25,434 --> 00:50:28,237
<i>It's telling me what to do and...</i>

334
00:50:29,037 --> 00:50:31,273
<i>...and the worst part is...</i>

335
00:50:31,773 --> 00:50:34,587
<i>...I wanna do what it tells me.</i>

336
00:50:38,713 --> 00:50:43,091
- That's the end of the tape.
- He comes in my dreams.

337
00:50:48,957 --> 00:50:52,405
Darkest night with taunting screams.

338
00:50:55,808 --> 00:50:58,977
He comes and won't let me dream.

339
00:51:03,971 --> 00:51:08,021
And all they do is scream and scream.

340
00:51:14,682 --> 00:51:16,729
Here, try this one.

341
00:51:26,444 --> 00:51:29,131
We don't have a lot of time for questions.

342
00:51:29,231 --> 00:51:33,819
Now you know that girl in there is not
your little girl anymore, so be quick.

343
00:51:33,919 --> 00:51:38,307
- Time is against us.
- Why our little girl? Why this house?

344
00:51:38,407 --> 00:51:44,246
The oldest, most complete manuscript
from the Bible the "Codex Vaticanus..."

345
00:51:45,046 --> 00:51:47,556
...is kept in the Vatican library in Rome.

346
00:51:48,242 --> 00:51:51,653
This manuscript is said to be
authored by God himself.

347
00:51:51,753 --> 00:51:55,958
Not like other religions or scriptures
not written by scholars or prophets.

348
00:51:56,058 --> 00:51:58,537
Written by God.

349
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:03,562
You understand the weight of that statement?

350
00:52:04,749 --> 00:52:08,896
Now we find a lot of demonic activity
along this line of latitude...

351
00:52:08,996 --> 00:52:14,019
...almost as an insult.
A mocking gesture towards the spirit.

352
00:52:15,042 --> 00:52:18,630
Now imagine a spiritual force field...

353
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:22,919
...that gets weaker and weaker
the further you get from the manuscript.

354
00:52:24,101 --> 00:52:26,598
Your house lies here.

355
00:52:27,054 --> 00:52:31,257
The furthest place on the planet
from the "Codex Vaticanus."

356
00:52:46,407 --> 00:52:48,821
<i>We need somewhere quiet to tie her down.</i>

357
00:52:50,104 --> 00:52:52,391
Hold her down. Hold her down.

358
00:53:04,758 --> 00:53:09,231
Untie me! Let me go! Let me go!

359
00:53:09,331 --> 00:53:13,145
Mom! Mom, please.

360
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:15,962
Dad, please.

361
00:53:18,807 --> 00:53:20,676
<i>You know what we have to do.</i>

362
00:53:20,776 --> 00:53:24,397
<i>You know our only job, only mission
is to make sure that he doesn't walk...</i>

363
00:53:24,497 --> 00:53:26,748
...or crawl out of hell.
Okay, that's what we get paid to do.

364
00:53:26,848 --> 00:53:31,583
I'm sorry, but Tranguul is a leach on
Katherine's soul. It's become one with her.

365
00:53:31,683 --> 00:53:34,890
You know we're not gonna be able to do
anything to separate one from the other.

366
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:38,503
- What does it want?
- This demon...

367
00:53:39,027 --> 00:53:41,263
...this Tranguul...

368
00:53:41,663 --> 00:53:43,864
...it brings your worst nightmares to life.

369
00:53:44,649 --> 00:53:48,501
And through that vulnerability,
possesses you.

370
00:53:52,373 --> 00:53:54,786
It wants to manifest in true form.

371
00:53:55,843 --> 00:53:57,489
True form?

372
00:53:58,879 --> 00:54:04,019
It needs a total of four living souls to
consume and then it'll walk the earth.

373
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:09,040
Four souls, one for each corner
of hell where it's trapped.

374
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:13,069
After that, it's unchained from its
suffering and it's free to walk the earth.

375
00:54:14,529 --> 00:54:16,542
Well, how do we beat it?

376
00:54:26,273 --> 00:54:28,154
The only way...

377
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:31,657
...is to burn the first possessed.

378
00:54:34,349 --> 00:54:36,615
This is a very powerful spirit.

379
00:54:37,985 --> 00:54:41,690
We cannot let it consume more souls
and it will do anything to survive.

380
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:44,293
The more souls it takes,
the stronger it gets.

381
00:54:44,393 --> 00:54:47,896
We're dealing with one
possession here with Katherine.

382
00:54:47,996 --> 00:54:51,933
Tranguul's spirit will double in
intensity for each soul he collects.

383
00:54:52,033 --> 00:54:53,883
We cannot let that happen.

384
00:54:56,053 --> 00:54:58,280
<i>He'll be unstoppable.</i>

385
00:55:04,211 --> 00:55:07,198
- This is too much! You're killing her!
- Hold him back!

386
00:55:07,298 --> 00:55:11,353
- You gotta stop! You're killing her!
- You've gotta stop this right now!

387
00:55:11,453 --> 00:55:13,522
We're not fighting for her body anymore!

388
00:55:13,622 --> 00:55:16,425
We kill her now
or this thing will take us all!

389
00:55:16,525 --> 00:55:19,204
- Stop!
- Get off me!

390
00:55:27,968 --> 00:55:29,782
Please, stop.

391
00:56:31,352 --> 00:56:35,053
<i>Come, let's get you to bed.</i>

392
00:56:35,936 --> 00:56:38,217
We'll be getting visitors soon.

393
00:56:44,044 --> 00:56:46,781
- Oh, shit.
- I say we get the fuck out of here.

394
00:56:46,881 --> 00:56:50,218
You saw the tapes, what the priest said.
That thing's gonna possess us all.

395
00:56:50,318 --> 00:56:52,854
And then what? What comes next?

396
00:56:52,954 --> 00:56:55,690
We're all tormented souls.
We're all mourning someone.

397
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:58,010
We're fucked if we stay here.

398
00:56:58,507 --> 00:57:01,023
- What about Katherine?
- What about Katherine?

399
00:57:01,123 --> 00:57:03,798
She's the last person
that we need to be worried about.

400
00:57:03,898 --> 00:57:08,180
- I say we pack our shit and get the fuck out.
- But there's a girl trapped inside there.

401
00:57:09,637 --> 00:57:11,940
Then we do this. We leave her here...

402
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,843
...and then when we're a safe
distance away we call the cops.

403
00:57:14,943 --> 00:57:17,112
Make it their problem.

404
00:57:17,212 --> 00:57:18,914
Yeah, he's onto something.

405
00:57:19,014 --> 00:57:22,694
Let them call the priest or wait for
the second coming or whatever, fuck it.

406
00:57:23,984 --> 00:57:25,864
Yeah, okay.

407
00:57:30,357 --> 00:57:31,960
James!

408
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,873
James!

409
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:42,190
He's gone.

410
00:57:47,201 --> 00:57:49,454
Well, there's only one way out of here.

411
00:58:30,117 --> 00:58:31,964
Jesus Christ!

412
00:58:38,859 --> 00:58:41,707
It's her! She's doing this!

413
00:58:56,844 --> 00:58:59,414
Fuck this shit. You better know
where you stand with us.

414
00:58:59,514 --> 00:59:03,785
I swear to God if you don't leave us alone
I will blow your fucking face off!

415
00:59:03,885 --> 00:59:05,946
There's no escaping.

416
00:59:07,748 --> 00:59:09,601
There's no running.

417
00:59:10,524 --> 00:59:12,537
You must just accept it.

418
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,664
Your souls are mine.

419
00:59:15,764 --> 00:59:17,642
Holy shit.

420
00:59:30,078 --> 00:59:33,291
Move, Hazel! Find the others! Go, go, go, go!

421
01:00:03,811 --> 01:00:06,014
If I possess you, Mark...

422
01:00:06,414 --> 01:00:08,449
...you go to hell forever.

423
01:00:08,549 --> 01:00:10,506
I know you wanna see your daughter again.

424
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:15,824
You wanna make a deal with the devil, Marky?

425
01:00:15,924 --> 01:00:19,527
I need two more souls.
You give me Hazel and the kid...

426
01:00:19,627 --> 01:00:22,174
...and I promise you walk away free.

427
01:00:47,955 --> 01:00:50,769
Georgie! Holy shit.

428
01:00:51,475 --> 01:00:53,328
Look, man...

429
01:00:53,428 --> 01:00:56,131
...what happened to us
was just a shit situation.

430
01:00:56,231 --> 01:00:58,310
Just bad fucking luck, alright?

431
01:01:00,567 --> 01:01:03,415
I woke up from that car crash
and you were already dead!

432
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,243
There was nothing I could do.

433
01:01:09,243 --> 01:01:12,547
I moved your fat fucking body
to make it look like you were driving.

434
01:01:12,647 --> 01:01:15,684
So fucking what? So fucking what?

435
01:01:16,084 --> 01:01:17,696
<i>Hazel.</i>

436
01:01:22,089 --> 01:01:23,602
Ade?

437
01:01:28,795 --> 01:01:30,476
<i>Hazel.</i>

438
01:01:35,602 --> 01:01:39,651
Now the fucking cops know everything, man.
They fucking know everything.

439
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,856
I'm out on bail right now...

440
01:01:42,956 --> 01:01:45,713
...awaiting a trial. I'm fucked. Fucked!

441
01:01:45,813 --> 01:01:47,892
I'm so sorry.

442
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:52,097
I'm so fucking sorry.

443
01:02:14,041 --> 01:02:15,687
James!

444
01:03:47,904 --> 01:03:49,481
Cuz?

445
01:03:50,871 --> 01:03:52,001
Ade!

446
01:04:18,231 --> 01:04:20,445
No! No!

447
01:04:46,661 --> 01:04:48,142
Fuck!

448
01:05:01,765 --> 01:05:03,254
Ade.

449
01:05:04,111 --> 01:05:06,124
He was gonna kill me.

450
01:05:09,649 --> 01:05:12,937
Come on. Let's find Mark
and get the fuck out of here.

451
01:05:23,864 --> 01:05:25,667
Oh, Jesus.

452
01:05:26,247 --> 01:05:28,112
Where is she?

453
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:32,440
- Fuck. Fuck!
- Hey, hey. Look at me.

454
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:34,786
Look at me. Look at me.

455
01:05:36,303 --> 01:05:39,123
When we get out of here,
just you and me in Panama.

456
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,949
We start a new life together.

457
01:05:42,049 --> 01:05:45,887
Yeah, I don't wanna run anymore.
I'm tired of always being on the move.

458
01:05:45,987 --> 01:05:48,222
- Get your hands on the desk.
- Mark.

459
01:05:48,322 --> 01:05:50,738
- Get your hands on the fucking desk.
- Mark, what are you doing?

460
01:05:50,838 --> 01:05:53,572
- Get your hands on the fucking desk now!
- Mark, please. Fuck.

461
01:05:53,672 --> 01:05:55,224
Now!

462
01:05:57,431 --> 01:06:00,645
Don't you get it? There is no out of this.

463
01:06:18,084 --> 01:06:19,974
You motherfucker.

464
01:06:20,074 --> 01:06:22,167
You stay the fuck down.

465
01:06:25,659 --> 01:06:27,573
Where the fuck are you?

466
01:06:29,847 --> 01:06:31,403
Shit.

467
01:06:44,913 --> 01:06:46,462
Holy shit.

468
01:06:47,747 --> 01:06:50,345
No. No. No.

469
01:06:52,086 --> 01:06:54,716
- Katherine.
- She can't be saved!

470
01:06:55,555 --> 01:06:58,770
- Mark, what are you doing?
- Only one of us gets out.

471
01:06:59,843 --> 01:07:02,844
Bullshit, that thing will kill you
the first chance it gets.

472
01:07:05,433 --> 01:07:08,536
I brought you them. Hazel has the keys.
You have your souls.

473
01:07:08,636 --> 01:07:10,849
I get to see my daughter again.

474
01:07:12,806 --> 01:07:14,653
Oh, fuck!

475
01:07:15,509 --> 01:07:16,820
Fuck!

476
01:07:17,011 --> 01:07:20,148
Come on, she's like your sister.
Please, we need to do this together.

477
01:07:20,248 --> 01:07:24,012
You leave us in here, then you've sold your
soul. There's no going back from this, Mark.

478
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:29,300
- Down! You get down!
- Alright! Alright!

479
01:07:30,223 --> 01:07:33,094
You unlock her. You unlock her now!

480
01:07:33,494 --> 01:07:36,548
You wanna do this? You do it yourself!

481
01:07:49,242 --> 01:07:52,523
- No, Mark, don't! Don't!
- Mark, come on.

482
01:07:56,416 --> 01:07:59,854
- I'm sorry. I'm fucking sorry.
- Oh, my God.

483
01:08:00,554 --> 01:08:02,434
Mark, what have you done?

484
01:08:02,989 --> 01:08:04,686
What have you done?

485
01:08:15,408 --> 01:08:18,125
Oh, shit! Stay the fuck away from me.

486
01:08:18,405 --> 01:08:20,132
Mark!

487
01:08:20,232 --> 01:08:22,676
Please! Help him!

488
01:08:32,787 --> 01:08:34,832
Mark, what have you done?

489
01:08:42,095 --> 01:08:44,296
Mark, you son of a bitch!

490
01:08:46,132 --> 01:08:47,779
Mark!

491
01:09:14,407 --> 01:09:15,952
Go!

492
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:18,677
Move! Get out!

493
01:09:23,203 --> 01:09:26,584
- Come on.
- Go, haze. I got this.

494
01:09:28,208 --> 01:09:31,222
Haze, you gotta go! Please!

495
01:09:31,744 --> 01:09:33,557
Come on.

496
01:09:36,583 --> 01:09:39,887
- Wait! Wait! We gotta go back for him.
- Come on!

497
01:09:39,987 --> 01:09:41,788
Come on! Quickly, come on!

498
01:09:55,301 --> 01:09:57,115
Let's move it.

499
01:10:04,945 --> 01:10:07,559
Quick! Go! Go!

500
01:10:10,785 --> 01:10:13,588
Come on! Come on, we need to move.

501
01:10:13,688 --> 01:10:15,286
Where?

502
01:10:30,136 --> 01:10:33,784
Come on. Follow me. Come on, let's go.

503
01:10:46,219 --> 01:10:48,499
Here. Here.

504
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:56,017
Oh, fuck. It's jammed.

505
01:10:56,117 --> 01:10:57,709
Move.

506
01:11:01,768 --> 01:11:03,581
Come on!

507
01:11:08,342 --> 01:11:10,221
Oh, fuck.

508
01:11:12,912 --> 01:11:14,759
Oh, shit.

509
01:12:27,986 --> 01:12:29,890
Hazel, come on!

510
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:32,403
Move it! Come on, quickly!

511
01:12:43,503 --> 01:12:46,210
- What are you doing? What are you doing?
- Mark was right.

512
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:48,642
No! Come on! Come on. What do you mean?

513
01:12:48,742 --> 01:12:53,013
- Only one of us can get out.
- Ade! No! Ade!

514
01:12:53,113 --> 01:12:55,314
All you can do is run, Hazel.

515
01:13:17,904 --> 01:13:20,541
No! Ade!

516
01:13:20,641 --> 01:13:24,578
No! Ade, no! Ade, no.

517
01:13:24,678 --> 01:13:26,481
No, damn it!

518
01:13:27,681 --> 01:13:31,095
- Come, come.
- Ade! Ade!

519
01:13:35,321 --> 01:13:37,601
No, no.

520
01:14:43,556 --> 01:14:45,403
Oh, fuck.

521
01:15:14,701 --> 01:15:16,250
Fuck.

522
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,707
No!

523
01:19:35,882 --> 01:19:37,472
Shit.

524
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:19,946
Come on.

525
01:21:20,653 --> 01:21:23,066
Burn in hell, you bitch.

526
01:21:24,305 --> 01:22:24,226
