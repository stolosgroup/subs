Sunday

3
00:01:31,682 --> 00:01:34,861
Let's jump, like we said!

4
00:01:34,853 --> 00:01:37,855
Use the ladder if
you're a stupid chicken.

5
00:01:38,815 --> 00:01:41,694
- Go on, Vityok. You're next.
- Why me?

6
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:45,698
- Scared?
- Go on, go on...

7
00:01:47,783 --> 00:01:51,036
- It's scary!
- Don't chicken out!

8
00:01:58,627 --> 00:02:01,045
Don't hurt your armpits!

9
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:11,473
- Andrei, let's use the ladder.
- You want to be called a chicken?

10
00:02:11,723 --> 00:02:13,518
What if something happens?

11
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:16,979
Quiet! You jump after me, got it?

12
00:02:48,344 --> 00:02:50,888
- Did you hurt your armpits?
- No.

13
00:02:51,307 --> 00:02:53,641
Come on, Shorty. Jump!

14
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:03,611
Hey! What's wrong?

15
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,157
If you're scared, climb down.
We're not waiting!

16
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:12,912
Wait! He's jumping!
He just needs to focus!

17
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,830
Vanya,

18
00:03:15,622 --> 00:03:18,918
jump! Come on!

19
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:25,673
Andrei, let's go!

20
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:29,720
It's already late!
Jump or climb down!

21
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:34,392
To hell with you then!

22
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,304
Vanya, my son!

23
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:16,018
Mum! Mummy!

24
00:04:18,811 --> 00:04:21,606
I told you not to come here!

25
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,865
Oh Lord!

26
00:04:29,281 --> 00:04:32,159
- Get dressed.
- I can't.

27
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:35,703
- Let's go home!
- I can't.

28
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,749
- Why?
- I have to jump.

29
00:04:38,957 --> 00:04:41,711
- I can't climb down.
- Why?

30
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:49,385
If I climb down,
they'll call me stupid and a chicken.

31
00:04:50,175 --> 00:04:53,431
No one will know! Don't worry!

32
00:04:54,307 --> 00:04:55,974
But you'll know

33
00:04:56,184 --> 00:05:00,730
I climbed down instead of jumping.

34
00:05:01,522 --> 00:05:04,233
Don't be silly, I won't tell anyone.

35
00:05:04,484 --> 00:05:06,849
You can jump another time.

36
00:05:06,527 --> 00:05:08,196
- Really?
- Of course.

37
00:05:08,404 --> 00:05:11,908
Mum, I was sitting here
and I was scared.

38
00:05:12,115 --> 00:05:14,118
If you hadn't come, I'd have died.

39
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:18,915
Don't be silly, dear!
Really, I'm here with you!

40
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,064
Monday

41
00:05:36,663 --> 00:05:38,352
Hello everyone!

42
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:45,401
Hello!

43
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:49,779
We don't talk to chickens.

44
00:05:50,446 --> 00:05:54,450
- What? Who's a chicken?
- You! A stupid chicken.

45
00:05:55,829 --> 00:05:57,495
You're a chicken. aren't you?

46
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:00,124
Go on, Andrei, what is he?

47
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:03,085
A chicken.

48
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:06,297
- Got it?
- You're a jerk!

49
00:06:25,107 --> 00:06:28,569
- You ripped my shirt, arse!
- You busted my lip, idiot.

50
00:06:28,777 --> 00:06:30,864
Mum'll kill you!

51
00:06:35,452 --> 00:06:38,912
Go on, catch me! Go on!

52
00:08:39,827 --> 00:08:41,704
Mum! He ripped my shirt!

53
00:08:41,913 --> 00:08:44,750
He's lying! He busted my lip!

54
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,212
- Hush, both of you.
- Mum...

55
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:49,589
I said quiet! Dad's sleeping!

56
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,758
Who?

57
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:53,133
Who's sleeping?

58
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:56,011
Your father.

59
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:04,102
Go in.

60
00:11:07,604 --> 00:11:10,691
That's definitely him.

61
00:12:08,082 --> 00:12:09,583
Pour them some wine.

62
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,671
Well, hello.

63
00:12:55,131 --> 00:12:56,381
Hello.

64
00:12:57,929 --> 00:12:58,842
Hello, Dad.

65
00:12:59,052 --> 00:13:00,552
Let's drink.

66
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:10,312
Like it?

67
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:12,773
Not really.

68
00:13:13,565 --> 00:13:16,693
I liked it.
Can I have some more?

69
00:13:16,902 --> 00:13:19,697
That's enough. Eat.

70
00:13:34,003 --> 00:13:37,048
- Is that your car in the yard?
- Yes.

71
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,134
- Will you give us a ride?
- Of course.

72
00:13:40,662 --> 00:13:43,889
- We're going on a trip.
- Really?

73
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:46,909
Really. Tomorrow morning.

74
00:13:46,766 --> 00:13:49,937
- Really, Mum?
- Really, son.

75
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:56,859
- Are we going fishing?
- Of course, if you want.

76
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,670
Shorty!

77
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,964
Listen, Shorty!

78
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,427
- What?
- Did you put the sinkers in?

79
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,429
Yes.

80
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:07,568
Good.

81
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:11,226
- You packed them yourself.
- Right.

82
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15,607
Did you see how big he is?
Probably works out.

83
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:17,733
Probably.

84
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:23,907
- Where did he come from?
- He just came.

85
00:15:24,115 --> 00:15:28,536
- Aren't you happy?
- Yes, I'm happy.

86
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:32,040
But Mum said he's a pilot.
Doesn't look like one.

87
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:34,264
Why?

88
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:36,544
Well, you know how pilots are.

89
00:15:36,795 --> 00:15:40,510
Uniforms, their caps...

90
00:15:45,304 --> 00:15:49,724
He's on holiday,
why would he wear a uniform?

91
00:15:49,934 --> 00:15:51,684
Maybe.

92
00:15:53,478 --> 00:15:55,439
Did you pack the camera?

93
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:59,193
Yes, and a notebook.

94
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,739
What for? Homework?

95
00:16:03,988 --> 00:16:07,243
To keep a diary, stupid!
We'll take turns.

96
00:16:07,493 --> 00:16:09,579
Yes, we can keep a diary!

97
00:16:09,954 --> 00:16:12,290
What's all this talk?
Why aren't you sleeping?

98
00:16:12,497 --> 00:16:14,417
Alright, Mum. We'll sleep.

99
00:16:16,001 --> 00:16:18,921
What did you put in here, bricks?

100
00:16:19,171 --> 00:16:22,801
- You'll be home in two days!
- We need all that!

101
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,594
Alright. Sleep.

102
00:16:30,225 --> 00:16:32,309
Where did he come from?

103
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,522
He just came.
Get to sleep, you're getting up early.

104
00:18:20,504 --> 00:18:22,256
Tuesday

105
00:19:15,643 --> 00:19:16,394
Ivan...

106
00:19:18,063 --> 00:19:21,483
- What?
- "What, Dad?"

107
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,984
What?

108
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,780
You should say, "What, Dad".

109
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,950
What... Dad?

110
00:19:31,242 --> 00:19:33,702
That's better. What's the problem?

111
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:38,333
Are you ashamed of calling
your father "Dad"?

112
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:41,045
- No...
- Don't lie to me!

113
00:19:41,295 --> 00:19:42,462
I'm not lying!

114
00:19:43,756 --> 00:19:46,883
Call me Dad, like a son should!
Got it?

115
00:19:47,092 --> 00:19:50,262
- Yes, Dad!
- Well done, son.

116
00:20:14,662 --> 00:20:18,373
- Andrei, where are we?
- Are you awake, Shorty?

117
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:20,292
I thought you'd sleep the whole way!

118
00:20:20,584 --> 00:20:24,089
- You're the one who slept the whole way.
- What?

119
00:20:26,494 --> 00:20:28,580
Are we there yet?

120
00:20:29,635 --> 00:20:32,472
I think another thirty kilometres.

121
00:20:34,474 --> 00:20:35,558
Yes.

122
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:40,397
- Who's he ringing?
- How should I know?

123
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,612
- I'm hungry.
- Hold on.

124
00:20:49,573 --> 00:20:52,450
The town's not far, we'll eat there.

125
00:20:52,616 --> 00:20:54,326
Dad said so.

126
00:20:54,578 --> 00:20:56,329
- Dad did?
- Yes.

127
00:20:56,537 --> 00:20:58,873
But I'm hungry now!

128
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:15,306
Ivan, get the flask from the rucksack.

129
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,270
Not there, in the pocket!

130
00:21:21,354 --> 00:21:22,689
Thank you.

131
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:27,986
Drinking and driving?

132
00:21:28,362 --> 00:21:30,990
- Yes, want some?
- No.

133
00:22:02,647 --> 00:22:05,233
Don't take a picture of that rubbish!

134
00:22:05,483 --> 00:22:07,833
Take a picture of me.

135
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,945
Hang on.

136
00:22:37,474 --> 00:22:38,307
Closed.

137
00:22:38,517 --> 00:22:41,395
- Dad, the cafe's closed.
- I can see.

138
00:22:43,814 --> 00:22:46,357
Andrei, go find out where we can eat.

139
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:50,378
- How?
- Ask someone, stupid!

140
00:22:50,071 --> 00:22:53,281
Hurry, get moving!

141
00:24:08,776 --> 00:24:11,737
- Where's Andrei?
- I'm hungry.

142
00:24:11,945 --> 00:24:14,740
He can find us, he's not a baby.

143
00:24:38,557 --> 00:24:39,933
Andrei!

144
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,811
Come here!

145
00:24:45,563 --> 00:24:47,065
Closer!

146
00:24:48,692 --> 00:24:50,401
- What're you doing here?
- Me?

147
00:24:51,861 --> 00:24:55,532
Yes, you.
What are you doing here?

148
00:24:56,157 --> 00:24:58,325
Dad, I found a restaurant.

149
00:24:58,535 --> 00:25:02,246
- It took you 3 hours!
- I just wanted to have a look.

150
00:25:03,248 --> 00:25:07,335
While we were waiting
you're standing here wasting time?

151
00:25:10,547 --> 00:25:13,105
This won't happen again, right?

152
00:25:14,009 --> 00:25:16,802
- I just wanted...
- Answer me! Right?

153
00:25:19,556 --> 00:25:21,641
I won't do it again, Dad.

154
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:26,021
Good. Let's go eat.

155
00:25:26,229 --> 00:25:28,565
- lvan, let's go!
- I'm not coming.

156
00:25:28,775 --> 00:25:31,319
- Why?
- I am not hungry anymore.

157
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,488
You said you were starving.

158
00:25:34,405 --> 00:25:36,948
It went away

159
00:25:37,575 --> 00:25:40,577
Ignore him, Dad.
He's as stubborn as a mule.

160
00:25:40,827 --> 00:25:45,541
- You go eat, I'll wait here.
- You're coming with us.

161
00:25:54,425 --> 00:25:55,842
Thank you.

162
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,985
Ivan, you have two minutes to eat.

163
00:26:14,987 --> 00:26:16,447
I'm not hungry.

164
00:26:20,827 --> 00:26:22,412
Your time's running out.

165
00:26:39,604 --> 00:26:41,765
Eat that bread.

166
00:26:41,973 --> 00:26:43,775
It's dirty.

167
00:26:44,476 --> 00:26:46,812
Who do you think is going to eat it?

168
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:51,191
Nobody. We'll just throw it away.

169
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,243
You've got thirty seconds left.

170
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:03,120
Eat your soup and bread.

171
00:27:05,873 --> 00:27:07,416
I'll be waiting in the car.

172
00:27:09,918 --> 00:27:13,380
Sit down and eat your bread and soup.
Got it?

173
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:16,258
Yes.

174
00:27:19,887 --> 00:27:21,722
"Yes, Dad."

175
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,308
Yes.

176
00:27:27,186 --> 00:27:29,522
Alright, sit down.

177
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:06,114
- Is everyone happy and full?
- Yes. Thanks, Dad.

178
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,771
- Yes.
- Good.

179
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:12,316
Here, call the waitress over and pay.

180
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,735
No, sit down and call her over!

181
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:19,198
- But how?
- With your mouth!

182
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,408
Lady!

183
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:23,118
Lady!

184
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:26,330
Andrei! "Excuse me."

185
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:31,001
- Excuse me.
- Just a moment.

186
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:35,382
Wait for me outside!

187
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:56,737
Hello? Hi, it's me.

188
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:01,323
What was that fit about the food?
Trying to be funny?

189
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:03,118
Get lost.

190
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:06,787
Did you see all this money?

191
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:09,374
- So what?
- Never mind.

192
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:10,958
Alright, boys!

193
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:16,131
- Got any money?
- No.

194
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,466
What if I find some?

195
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:21,929
All right, then.

196
00:29:26,892 --> 00:29:28,436
Sergei, let's go!

197
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:33,148
They stole the wallet! Get them.

198
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,192
Can't you do it yourself?

199
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:37,903
Wait for me here!

200
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:42,992
I don't know how it happened.
They just attacked us.

201
00:29:59,717 --> 00:30:03,471
If he finds them, he'll kill them!
I would.

202
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:39,727
Follow me!

203
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:51,477
- Is it him?
- He stole the money!

204
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,856
- He's yours.
- What do you mean?

205
00:30:54,064 --> 00:30:57,037
He hit you.
Do what you want with him.

206
00:30:57,067 --> 00:30:59,653
- Please, don't!
- Shut up!

207
00:31:01,198 --> 00:31:04,032
Go to it, he hit you.

208
00:31:04,783 --> 00:31:07,244
No, I don't want to!

209
00:31:11,407 --> 00:31:14,793
- lvan, he hit you too. Come on, son!
- Let him go!

210
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:18,706
- What was the money for?
- I was hungry.

211
00:31:20,758 --> 00:31:22,634
Get out of here!

212
00:31:26,225 --> 00:31:27,639
You have no guts!

213
00:31:28,849 --> 00:31:31,478
- I wasn't ready.
- You should always be ready.

214
00:31:31,685 --> 00:31:34,646
- What if I hadn't got the money back?
- I don't know.

215
00:31:34,856 --> 00:31:39,194
- Why didn't you come out?
- I was on the phone.

216
00:31:44,407 --> 00:31:46,868
Andrei, lvan, come here!

217
00:31:47,827 --> 00:31:49,829
Get your stuff.

218
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:54,501
Don't forget the rods.

219
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,089
Andrei,
here's enough for two tickets home.

220
00:31:59,297 --> 00:32:00,616
There's your bus.

221
00:32:02,425 --> 00:32:05,637
- Why?
- I've got business to do!

222
00:32:05,887 --> 00:32:09,182
- What about the waterfalls?
- Next time!

223
00:32:09,392 --> 00:32:11,435
Next time...

224
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:13,520
In another 12 years?

225
00:32:14,187 --> 00:32:15,981
What did you say?

226
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:21,611
It will be another twelve years before
you take us to the waterfalls again.

227
00:32:21,821 --> 00:32:25,424
Did I say something wrong?

228
00:32:29,078 --> 00:32:30,913
- Dad!
- Go with your brother.

229
00:32:31,122 --> 00:32:32,373
Go, go...

230
00:32:49,682 --> 00:32:54,062
- It must be about the money.
- No, it's not.

231
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:00,430
Then because you threw a fit
in the restaurant.

232
00:33:01,277 --> 00:33:02,529
That's not why!

233
00:33:02,777 --> 00:33:06,574
- What then, brainy?
- He couldn't care less about us.

234
00:33:06,825 --> 00:33:09,744
Only an idiot like you can't see it.

235
00:33:09,952 --> 00:33:12,914
- Who's an idiot?
- You!

236
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:16,542
You're a chicken!

237
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:24,426
You're a dick!

238
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:31,684
Get off!

239
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:41,109
See what an idiot you are!

240
00:33:43,946 --> 00:33:47,407
What about your business?
Are we going to the falls?

241
00:33:47,616 --> 00:33:50,453
I've got exactly three days

242
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,498
to get somewhere for business.

243
00:33:53,747 --> 00:33:56,083
Then we'll go to the falls. Alright?

244
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:59,003
Mum's expecting us tomorrow morning.

245
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:03,257
Don't you want to spend
three more days with your dad?

246
00:34:04,437 --> 00:34:05,927
Or wait another 12 years?

247
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,137
What do you think?

248
00:34:08,638 --> 00:34:10,722
We wanted to fish.

249
00:34:10,973 --> 00:34:14,311
And Mum knows we're with you.
So it's fine with me.

250
00:34:18,232 --> 00:34:19,315
Unanimous!

251
00:37:19,498 --> 00:37:21,542
Andrei, get in, we're off!

252
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,889
I'm hungry!

253
00:37:34,598 --> 00:37:38,072
- Andrei, are you hungry?
- No.

254
00:37:37,642 --> 00:37:40,645
Me neither. Wait for supper.

255
00:37:55,368 --> 00:37:57,287
I'm off to get one...

256
00:38:02,876 --> 00:38:06,130
- There're so much fish here!
- There are loads!

257
00:38:09,801 --> 00:38:12,260
- Get me one!
- Get it yourself.

258
00:38:12,512 --> 00:38:16,099
I dare you to ask me for something else.

259
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,181
Here, eat this!

260
00:38:44,502 --> 00:38:46,338
What do I do with it?

261
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:50,466
We could make fish soup.
Do you know how?

262
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,096
Yes, but I don't eat fish.

263
00:38:55,723 --> 00:38:59,768
- Why?
- I've had too much fish.

264
00:39:01,228 --> 00:39:02,730
Where?

265
00:39:04,648 --> 00:39:06,108
Far away.

266
00:39:06,441 --> 00:39:08,986
Don't forget to put the fire out.

267
00:39:10,237 --> 00:39:13,907
Hey, geniuses!
Who puts a tent up like this?

268
00:39:15,284 --> 00:39:17,327
Stretch it out!

269
00:39:39,768 --> 00:39:41,351
Andrei.

270
00:39:43,563 --> 00:39:46,065
- Andrei!
- What?

271
00:39:46,274 --> 00:39:50,445
What did he say about fish?
Where could that happen?

272
00:39:51,029 --> 00:39:54,281
In the North, maybe.

273
00:39:54,824 --> 00:39:58,995
Did you see how quiet he got
when you asked him where?

274
00:40:00,444 --> 00:40:01,998
Why?

275
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:07,108
Who knows?
Maybe he wants to forget.

276
00:40:08,629 --> 00:40:13,635
- Why?
- "Why, why"! How would I know?

277
00:40:20,642 --> 00:40:23,770
- He lies about everything!
- He's not lying.

278
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,856
Who knows where he's been.

279
00:40:27,774 --> 00:40:29,943
Why do you suck up to him?

280
00:40:30,151 --> 00:40:35,198
- Who sucks up?
- You do! "Dad this, Dad that."

281
00:40:36,074 --> 00:40:39,745
- He's a grownup.
- So? Are we short of grownups?

282
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:43,164
You believe every word he says.

283
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:48,879
And who is he?
He could be a gangster!

284
00:40:49,424 --> 00:40:51,882
He could slit our throats in the forest!

285
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:54,927
- What?
- You heard!

286
00:40:56,804 --> 00:40:59,265
You're stupid, Shorty.

287
00:40:59,472 --> 00:41:04,061
We'll see who's stupid
when he gets his knife out.

288
00:41:04,603 --> 00:41:06,815
Go ahead and laugh.

289
00:41:09,859 --> 00:41:11,944
Ivan the fool is about to get slit!

290
00:41:12,193 --> 00:41:16,115
- What're you doing?
- Little lvan's going to get slit!

291
00:41:17,032 --> 00:41:20,078
Knock it off!

292
00:41:22,783 --> 00:41:23,874
- Do you give up?
- Get off!

293
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:27,084
- Give up!
- Don't you get it?

294
00:41:27,293 --> 00:41:32,158
How do I know he's our dad?
Why do you believe him?

295
00:41:32,799 --> 00:41:36,595
Idiot! Mum said he's our father.

296
00:41:37,636 --> 00:41:40,474
Our father! Got it?

297
00:41:41,141 --> 00:41:42,476
Idiot!

298
00:41:51,486 --> 00:41:52,861
Shorty?

299
00:41:54,072 --> 00:41:57,491
Vanya! Are you crying?

300
00:41:57,741 --> 00:41:59,260
Get lost!

301
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:01,620
You got these crazy ideas in your head.

302
00:42:01,912 --> 00:42:04,332
I want to go home.

303
00:42:15,884 --> 00:42:18,678
Let's go fishing tomorrow.

304
00:42:19,472 --> 00:42:22,642
Early in the morning, while he's asleep.

305
00:42:23,601 --> 00:42:25,812
They bite a lot at dawn!

306
00:42:26,021 --> 00:42:28,814
Okay, Vanya?

307
00:42:30,483 --> 00:42:31,943
Alright.

308
00:42:33,069 --> 00:42:35,279
Sleep then.

309
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:39,242
What's that?

310
00:42:39,492 --> 00:42:42,453
The diary, it's your turn.

311
00:42:43,496 --> 00:42:46,707
Tomorrow, it's late now.

312
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:51,587
Get the torch, we said every day!

313
00:43:07,979 --> 00:43:10,315
Nothing ever gets past you, does it?

314
00:43:10,524 --> 00:43:11,984
Just write!

315
00:43:12,192 --> 00:43:14,278
Wednesday

316
00:44:04,913 --> 00:44:08,540
Shorty, get the rods ready.

317
00:44:08,792 --> 00:44:09,834
To go where?

318
00:44:10,376 --> 00:44:13,463
- Further on.
- Is that what Dad said?

319
00:44:13,671 --> 00:44:15,591
Yes, Dad said. Let's go!

320
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,850
Why did we have to go?
They just started biting.

321
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,604
Leave that channel.

322
00:45:12,895 --> 00:45:14,400
I wasted all the bait.

323
00:45:30,666 --> 00:45:32,585
Turn it off.

324
00:45:35,671 --> 00:45:37,966
I saw a huge pike there!

325
00:45:38,467 --> 00:45:41,343
We could have tried the spinning rod.

326
00:45:43,137 --> 00:45:47,100
Andrei,
check how much further to Beketovo.

327
00:45:48,548 --> 00:45:52,146
Who needs this Beketovo?
There's great fishing here!

328
00:46:00,112 --> 00:46:01,907
Why are you complaining?

329
00:46:02,116 --> 00:46:06,661
We could have fished more,
we're on holiday.

330
00:46:18,508 --> 00:46:20,509
Get out!

331
00:46:23,012 --> 00:46:25,139
Here, fish.

332
00:49:24,947 --> 00:49:27,116
So, are they biting?

333
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:30,453
Here, get changed.

334
00:49:38,128 --> 00:49:40,838
Tell me why you came.

335
00:49:41,255 --> 00:49:42,923
What for?

336
00:49:44,925 --> 00:49:47,762
Why did you make us come?

337
00:49:50,724 --> 00:49:52,309
You don't need us!

338
00:49:53,351 --> 00:49:58,045
We were fine without you!
With Mum and Granny!

339
00:49:57,898 --> 00:49:59,983
Why did you come?

340
00:50:00,191 --> 00:50:03,153
Why did you take us with you?

341
00:50:04,863 --> 00:50:08,492
What do you need us for?
Answer me!

342
00:50:08,699 --> 00:50:13,121
- Mum asked me to spend time with you.
- Mum did?

343
00:50:13,687 --> 00:50:17,042
- What about you?
- I want to spend time with you too.

344
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:20,754
Why? To taunt us?

345
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:26,427
Get changed.

346
00:50:53,914 --> 00:50:56,416
Are we stuck, Dad?

347
00:51:12,515 --> 00:51:15,601
Alright, get out of the car.

348
00:51:19,105 --> 00:51:21,233
You can at least take your shoes off!

349
00:51:21,691 --> 00:51:22,818
What?

350
00:51:23,777 --> 00:51:25,446
Ivan, take your shoes off!

351
00:51:35,664 --> 00:51:38,101
Here, put your coat on!

352
00:51:44,131 --> 00:51:45,674
Cut some branches.

353
00:51:57,479 --> 00:52:03,067
Andrei, let's tell him
that we're not going anywhere else!

354
00:52:03,568 --> 00:52:06,154
Let's make him take us back home!

355
00:52:06,361 --> 00:52:07,946
I don't want to.

356
00:52:08,156 --> 00:52:10,908
- How much longer?
- One second.

357
00:52:18,917 --> 00:52:21,752
Put the branches under the wheels.

358
00:52:25,965 --> 00:52:28,635
I said under, not in front!

359
00:52:29,386 --> 00:52:30,887
But how?

360
00:52:32,263 --> 00:52:34,766
With your hands, with your hands!

361
00:52:36,308 --> 00:52:38,958
I'll show you once.

362
00:52:40,312 --> 00:52:41,356
- Got it?
- Yes.

363
00:52:41,564 --> 00:52:44,401
Now, do the same with the other wheel.

364
00:52:53,076 --> 00:52:54,620
What are you doing now?

365
00:52:54,829 --> 00:52:58,771
What?
Why don't you just do it yourself!

366
00:53:07,675 --> 00:53:09,885
Stand behind and push!

367
00:53:11,887 --> 00:53:14,849
Push. On the count of three.

368
00:53:15,057 --> 00:53:17,602
One, two, three, push. Got it?

369
00:53:18,018 --> 00:53:19,311
Got it!

370
00:53:23,441 --> 00:53:24,942
Had enough?

371
00:53:32,366 --> 00:53:34,077
Go and steer.

372
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:37,579
Throttle on the right,
clutch on the left.

373
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:38,832
I know.

374
00:53:48,793 --> 00:53:49,885
Do it!

375
00:53:54,723 --> 00:53:56,640
Good work, Andrei!

376
00:53:57,142 --> 00:53:58,684
Move it.

377
00:54:00,187 --> 00:54:02,230
Ivan, get in!

378
00:54:34,888 --> 00:54:36,932
Thursday

379
00:54:50,276 --> 00:54:53,116
Dad, what is this place?
Where are we?

380
00:54:55,410 --> 00:55:00,414
- Is there anyone here?
- No. Just us.

381
00:55:00,623 --> 00:55:04,544
- What are we doing here?
- Nothing.

382
00:55:04,751 --> 00:55:07,505
- We're going to an island.
- An island?

383
00:55:07,713 --> 00:55:10,175
Which one? That one?

384
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:12,927
No, another one.

385
00:55:16,139 --> 00:55:17,765
Get out.

386
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:55,637
Wind it up tight,
so it won't rock.

387
00:55:56,138 --> 00:56:00,100
Found it? Good, put it on the fire.

388
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:06,147
- Dad, what's next?
- We'll tar boat and set sail.

389
00:56:06,983 --> 00:56:09,819
- Will it take a long time?
- Yes.

390
00:56:34,761 --> 00:56:38,473
Andrei, spread it better
so there are no gaps.

391
00:56:40,141 --> 00:56:42,060
That seam there.

392
00:56:54,739 --> 00:56:57,075
Let the boat down to the water.

393
00:56:57,576 --> 00:56:59,786
Put the things in.

394
00:58:37,677 --> 00:58:39,847
Start rowing!

395
00:58:53,538 --> 00:58:55,206
What are you staring at? Row!

396
00:58:54,946 --> 00:58:57,156
- Where to?
- Straight ahead.

397
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:03,287
Ivan, keep the bow towards the wave,
blockhead!

398
00:59:03,496 --> 00:59:05,331
I can't!

399
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:10,795
Row on my command!
Oars up!

400
00:59:11,295 --> 00:59:14,258
I said oars up!

401
00:59:15,007 --> 00:59:16,008
Row!

402
00:59:16,551 --> 00:59:19,971
Heave! Heave!

403
00:59:20,179 --> 00:59:22,723
That's it, Andrei!

404
00:59:22,974 --> 00:59:25,853
Heave, heave!

405
00:59:33,943 --> 00:59:38,157
- I can't go on!
- Yes, you can!

406
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:41,784
You row, you're stronger!

407
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:47,415
Heave, heave!

408
01:00:32,836 --> 01:00:34,631
We're here.

409
01:02:19,446 --> 01:02:23,450
- Did you hang your wet clothes up?
- Of course, Dad.

410
01:02:27,412 --> 01:02:29,664
Hold your breath and drink.

411
01:02:44,429 --> 01:02:46,723
- Drink!
- I don't want to.

412
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:49,708
Drink!

413
01:02:55,399 --> 01:02:57,192
Wash it down.

414
01:03:13,126 --> 01:03:14,714
What, Dad?

415
01:03:17,004 --> 01:03:18,965
Go to sleep.

416
01:03:45,825 --> 01:03:48,036
How are you, Shorty?

417
01:03:48,411 --> 01:03:51,623
If he touches me again, I'll kill him.

418
01:04:00,175 --> 01:04:02,009
Damn, it's soaking wet!

419
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:06,197
- Are you serious?
- What?

420
01:04:05,847 --> 01:04:10,100
- About killing him?
- If he touches me, I will.

421
01:04:12,436 --> 01:04:13,938
I see.

422
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:29,995
Friday

423
01:04:41,216 --> 01:04:45,385
- Where did you get that?
- From the tent.

424
01:04:45,386 --> 01:04:48,431
- Is he sleeping?
- He's not there.

425
01:04:48,681 --> 01:04:50,599
Where is he?

426
01:04:53,812 --> 01:04:56,689
- Did you steal that?
- Yes.

427
01:04:58,983 --> 01:05:04,280
- Put it back now!
- No, I want it with me.

428
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:05,783
Why?

429
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:12,372
- What if he notices his knife's gone?
- I don't care.

430
01:05:14,573 --> 01:05:17,043
I didn't do it, he lost it.

431
01:05:17,753 --> 01:05:20,423
- You won't tell him, will you?
- Of course not.

432
01:05:20,631 --> 01:05:22,258
Then what's the problem?

433
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:27,303
I saw a fish jumping by the shore.

434
01:05:29,097 --> 01:05:30,433
It was this big!

435
01:05:31,142 --> 01:05:34,353
We need worms though.
That one won't go for bread.

436
01:05:35,019 --> 01:05:38,064
Don't bring the knife.
Not now, later.

437
01:05:38,546 --> 01:05:40,317
No, I want to have it with me.

438
01:05:40,443 --> 01:05:41,528
Let's go, sleepy-heads!

439
01:05:41,902 --> 01:05:45,448
I'll show you the island.

440
01:05:47,451 --> 01:05:52,205
- What about breakfast?
- You can have it later. Let's go!

441
01:05:54,749 --> 01:05:57,168
- lvan, what's wrong?
- My leg hurts.

442
01:05:58,335 --> 01:06:02,006
Your leg?
It probably fell asleep, let's go.

443
01:06:02,339 --> 01:06:05,012
My leg hurts!

444
01:06:07,011 --> 01:06:10,515
If it doesn't go away you can come back.

445
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:09,553
Follow me, kids!

446
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,848
Now you'll see.

447
01:08:21,105 --> 01:08:25,235
- Well, are you coming up?
- Go on, go on...

448
01:08:25,486 --> 01:08:28,208
Are you scared?

449
01:08:28,155 --> 01:08:29,865
My leg hurts.

450
01:09:09,406 --> 01:09:12,784
- Give me your hand. Where's lvan?
- He didn't come.

451
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:18,123
He's scared of heights, Dad.

452
01:09:18,665 --> 01:09:19,666
Cool!

453
01:09:19,917 --> 01:09:21,543
Come here!

454
01:09:25,798 --> 01:09:27,882
Look over there!

455
01:09:28,591 --> 01:09:29,552
Wow!

456
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:55,411
Andrei, get down, quickly!

457
01:10:15,931 --> 01:10:18,100
Do you know this joke?

458
01:10:18,393 --> 01:10:23,647
A guy rings:
"Hello, is that the missile base?"

459
01:10:23,856 --> 01:10:25,484
"You got the wrong number."

460
01:10:25,691 --> 01:10:28,987
"No, you're the one
who got the wrong number, dear!"

461
01:10:30,739 --> 01:10:34,201
Another one. A guy is riding a camel...

462
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:39,526
Okay, that's enough.
Thanks for the company.

463
01:10:38,955 --> 01:10:43,042
Andrei and I will get some wood,
you wash dishes, lvan.

464
01:10:43,251 --> 01:10:47,756
- Why do I have to wash up?
- Last one cleans up.

465
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:06,995
Not bad, for the first time.

466
01:12:06,837 --> 01:12:08,130
You know...

467
01:12:11,050 --> 01:12:13,051
your bowl sank.

468
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:15,345
Sank?

469
01:12:18,807 --> 01:12:21,018
A wave carried it away.

470
01:12:23,061 --> 01:12:24,812
A wave?

471
01:12:25,939 --> 01:12:28,318
How am I supposed to eat now?

472
01:12:30,009 --> 01:12:31,152
I didn't do it on purpose.

473
01:12:32,779 --> 01:12:36,892
Alright, I'll show you how
to make a bowl from wood.

474
01:12:36,658 --> 01:12:40,287
- I won't be able to.
- I'll teach you.

475
01:13:07,101 --> 01:13:09,651
- Now what's wrong?
- Nothing.

476
01:13:10,610 --> 01:13:12,320
Look after yourselves for a bit.

477
01:13:13,775 --> 01:13:16,616
- Where are you going, Dad?
- For a walk.

478
01:13:16,866 --> 01:13:21,830
We need worms.
The fish here won't go for bread.

479
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,248
Find some.

480
01:13:23,498 --> 01:13:26,292
Easier said than done...

481
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,461
It's all sand round here!

482
01:13:28,711 --> 01:13:32,967
- Why did he take the rucksack?
- Maybe to pick mushrooms.

483
01:13:36,761 --> 01:13:41,015
Why don't we go into the forest
to get some worms?

484
01:13:41,642 --> 01:13:46,397
- It's too far.
- But we need the worms.

485
01:13:46,772 --> 01:13:48,232
Then let's go.

486
01:13:48,691 --> 01:13:50,358
Bring a jar.

487
01:13:53,779 --> 01:13:56,365
- Will this do?
- It will do fine!

488
01:14:24,059 --> 01:14:27,897
- Is this really an island?
- Yes, I'm telling you it is.

489
01:14:28,105 --> 01:14:31,484
I was up on the tower,
there is water all around.

490
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:36,072
- No one else is here?
- Looks that way.

491
01:15:49,731 --> 01:15:52,817
- It's probably 100 years old.
- Probably.

492
01:16:06,998 --> 01:16:10,126
- Andrei, where are you?
- I'm coming.

493
01:16:15,757 --> 01:16:17,134
Come here.

494
01:16:18,217 --> 01:16:22,263
- Look.
- How did this pit get here?

495
01:16:22,473 --> 01:16:25,642
Who cares, it's full of worms!

496
01:16:31,373 --> 01:16:32,900
Where's the jar?

497
01:16:55,589 --> 01:16:57,925
The fish will be begging for these worms.

498
01:16:58,133 --> 01:17:01,804
- Shall we cast from the shore?
- No, from the boat.

499
01:17:02,054 --> 01:17:05,057
Wait, we have to get Dad's permission.

500
01:17:06,058 --> 01:17:07,895
- Vanya!
- Why?

501
01:17:08,143 --> 01:17:10,647
Can't we row on our own?

502
01:17:10,979 --> 01:17:12,649
Come on, push.

503
01:17:27,287 --> 01:17:32,001
- Where are you going? Get back here!
- We won't go far.

504
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:35,130
Dad, we won't be long!

505
01:17:44,931 --> 01:17:48,102
Here, be back in an hour.

506
01:17:48,351 --> 01:17:51,564
- At 3:30. We have to leave.
- Got it, Dad.

507
01:17:51,772 --> 01:17:53,983
Come on, sit down.

508
01:18:02,241 --> 01:18:05,182
Be back here in an hour!

509
01:18:06,412 --> 01:18:09,915
- And stay where I can see you.
- Got it, Dad.

510
01:18:11,917 --> 01:18:14,086
"Got it, Dad!"

511
01:18:14,795 --> 01:18:18,132
You're asking for it, Shorty!
I'm warning you!

512
01:18:31,897 --> 01:18:35,524
Shorty, let's go.
It's already three o'clock.

513
01:18:35,816 --> 01:18:38,653
Dad said to be back in half an hour.

514
01:18:38,904 --> 01:18:41,573
I'll just cast a couple more times.

515
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:47,579
There's no point.
They're not biting today.

516
01:18:48,038 --> 01:18:51,374
Andrei, let's go a little further.

517
01:18:51,958 --> 01:18:54,836
- Dad said to go back!
- Will you stop nagging?

518
01:18:55,044 --> 01:18:58,215
Just a bit further then we'll go back.

519
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,551
Alright, come on then.

520
01:20:27,597 --> 01:20:29,975
Andrei! Come here!

521
01:20:31,185 --> 01:20:32,102
Hurry!

522
01:20:38,317 --> 01:20:39,568
What's wrong?

523
01:20:40,026 --> 01:20:42,862
I saw a huge fish there!

524
01:20:43,113 --> 01:20:43,739
Where?

525
01:20:44,635 --> 01:20:47,701
- Andrei, run and get the rod!
- Why me?

526
01:20:47,911 --> 01:20:49,286
- Hurry!
- Shit!

527
01:20:53,958 --> 01:20:55,793
What'll we tell dad?

528
01:20:56,043 --> 01:21:00,277
That we caught a fish
but it wasn't your idea.

529
01:21:42,048 --> 01:21:45,802
- Look what we caught!
- Andrei, what time is it?

530
01:21:46,545 --> 01:21:49,639
- What?
- What time does your watch say?

531
01:21:52,187 --> 01:21:53,101
Seven o'clock, Dad...

532
01:21:53,845 --> 01:21:57,356
- When were you supposed to be back?
- At half past three...

533
01:21:57,605 --> 01:21:59,399
Did you see this fish?

534
01:21:59,649 --> 01:22:02,187
I'm not talking to you.

535
01:22:04,488 --> 01:22:06,974
Why were you late?

536
01:22:07,073 --> 01:22:08,367
Well, you see...

537
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,326
What are you doing?

538
01:22:10,579 --> 01:22:13,329
- Did you hear me calling you?
- No!

539
01:22:14,790 --> 01:22:18,225
Don't even think about hitting me!

540
01:22:17,542 --> 01:22:19,044
Let me explain, the fish...

541
01:22:19,254 --> 01:22:22,631
- Why did I give you the watch?
- So, I'd have the time.

542
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:24,967
- And what happened?
- We caught a fish!

543
01:22:26,151 --> 01:22:29,723
Don't touch him, it was me!
We found a ship!

544
01:22:29,972 --> 01:22:33,434
Daddy, it's true!
It was lvan.

545
01:22:33,642 --> 01:22:35,644
But you had the watch!

546
01:22:35,854 --> 01:22:39,940
What do you want from me?
You're a coward, scum!

547
01:22:41,067 --> 01:22:43,868
Kill me then, just kill me!

548
01:22:44,910 --> 01:22:47,006
You're a bastard! I hate you!

549
01:22:46,698 --> 01:22:48,658
- Kill you?
- Yes!

550
01:22:48,867 --> 01:22:51,161
- Kill you?
- Yes!

551
01:22:51,786 --> 01:22:55,623
Stop! Touch him and I'll kill you!

552
01:22:56,415 --> 01:22:59,926
- You'll kill me?
- Get back!

553
01:23:01,797 --> 01:23:03,507
Get back!

554
01:23:04,716 --> 01:23:06,009
Don't move!

555
01:23:06,371 --> 01:23:11,098
If you weren't so evil
I could love you like a father!

556
01:23:11,348 --> 01:23:15,143
I hate you!
Don't even think about hurting us!

557
01:23:15,478 --> 01:23:17,437
You're no one!

558
01:23:18,259 --> 01:23:21,398
- You're wrong, son...
- No, no, no!

559
01:23:22,777 --> 01:23:24,932
Ivan!

560
01:23:25,237 --> 01:23:26,989
Stay here!

561
01:23:38,375 --> 01:23:39,544
Ivan!

562
01:23:57,978 --> 01:23:59,230
Ivan!

563
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:07,666
Dad!

564
01:24:20,043 --> 01:24:23,297
Ivan, wait for me.

565
01:24:32,431 --> 01:24:34,850
Stop, lvan!

566
01:25:01,335 --> 01:25:04,811
Go away! I hate you!

567
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:06,507
Son, open up! Let me in!

568
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:10,178
- What do you want, go away!
- Son, please.

569
01:25:10,817 --> 01:25:14,014
If you don't leave, I'll jump!
Hear that, I'll jump!

570
01:25:14,224 --> 01:25:18,603
- Don't move, wait for me.
- Did you hear me, I'll jump!

571
01:25:26,778 --> 01:25:28,571
I can do it!

572
01:25:28,822 --> 01:25:30,672
I can!

573
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,201
You hear, I can!

574
01:25:35,703 --> 01:25:37,287
Did you hear me?

575
01:25:37,622 --> 01:25:40,834
Hear that? I can do anything!

576
01:25:41,584 --> 01:25:44,046
Asshole, I can do it!

577
01:25:47,549 --> 01:25:49,390
Vanya, son...

578
01:26:21,499 --> 01:26:23,002
Andrei...

579
01:26:23,794 --> 01:26:25,212
He's dead.

580
01:26:40,644 --> 01:26:43,607
We have to take him away.

581
01:26:43,815 --> 01:26:45,609
Where to?

582
01:26:47,486 --> 01:26:49,111
The boat.

583
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:51,864
How?

584
01:26:52,073 --> 01:26:53,867
"With your hands"!

585
01:27:01,207 --> 01:27:04,628
What are you looking at?
Take him by his legs.

586
01:27:20,435 --> 01:27:22,021
I can't.

587
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:25,681
Come here.

588
01:27:26,359 --> 01:27:28,611
We'll drag him by his arms.

589
01:27:57,347 --> 01:28:00,976
- Get the axe.
- What for?

590
01:28:01,185 --> 01:28:04,313
I said get the axe, idiot!

591
01:29:03,651 --> 01:29:05,167
I can't, Andrei.

592
01:29:05,376 --> 01:29:07,878
Hang on, we can rest a little.

593
01:29:22,268 --> 01:29:25,646
- It's the wrong way, Andrei.
- It's the right way.

594
01:29:26,154 --> 01:29:28,107
We're lost, I'm telling you.

595
01:29:28,316 --> 01:29:30,442
Get up, let's go.

596
01:29:33,029 --> 01:29:34,914
Andrei!

597
01:29:36,782 --> 01:29:37,659
What?

598
01:29:37,867 --> 01:29:40,160
What should we do?

599
01:29:41,287 --> 01:29:43,414
His eyes are open.

600
01:29:57,929 --> 01:30:00,098
Get up, let's go.

601
01:31:08,836 --> 01:31:11,424
Saturday

602
01:32:53,692 --> 01:32:55,861
Let's load everything in.

603
01:35:03,282 --> 01:35:08,496
- What was that?
- I don't know. We hit a stone.

604
01:37:57,266 --> 01:37:59,796
Let's take the stuff to the car.

605
01:38:54,453 --> 01:38:55,978
Wait.

606
01:38:56,938 --> 01:38:59,149
We'll put him inside.

607
01:39:25,091 --> 01:39:26,342
Dad!

608
01:39:27,093 --> 01:39:28,261
Dad!

609
01:39:29,512 --> 01:39:31,263
Dad!

610
01:39:33,057 --> 01:39:34,913
Dad!

611
01:41:05,319 --> 01:41:06,819
Look!

612
01:41:13,827 --> 01:41:14,828
Hide it.

613
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,463
- Andrei, my feet are wet.
- Take your shoes off.

614
01:41:25,305 --> 01:42:25,317
