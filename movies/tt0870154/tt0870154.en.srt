00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,618
All legends are born in truth.

4
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,912
From the Amazon

5
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,415
came the legend of the Tears of the Moon.

6
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,252
A single petal from the great Tree

7
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,547
could cure any illness
and break any curse.

8
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,760
Over the centuries,

9
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,762
many expeditions went searching

10
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,056
for the Healing Tears of legend.

11
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,893
None more famous

12
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:03,021
than that of the conquistador
Don Lope de Aguirre,

13
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:08,359
who was determined to possess
the Tears' power.

14
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,404
But the jungle protected the Tears.

15
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:18,620
History will tell you
his journey ended in failure.

16
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,748
But legend tells more.

17
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,293
That he was found
by the Guardians of the Tree

18
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,753
and nursed back to life.

19
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,798
That he demanded they give him
the sacred Arrowhead,

20
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,592
the key to finding the Tears of the Moon.

21
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,179
That Aguirre attacked.

22
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,100
But the jungle defended,

23
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,644
and Aguirre and his conquistadors
were taken,

24
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,980
cursed, never to leave sight
of the river again,

25
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,483
unable to leave or die...

26
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,777
...or so the legend goes.

27
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,113
"We know they disappeared here,

28
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,115
"in the region of Lágrimas de Cristal,

29
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:59,786
"and it is here that we will find
the true source of the legend,

30
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:03,456
"a tree that possesses
unparalleled healing powers.

31
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,083
"My esteemed colleagues..."

32
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,127
"...I assert that the famous legend

33
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,629
"of the Tears of the Moon is not a myth

34
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,840
- "but scientific truth."
- ...but scientific truth.

35
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,968
"One that could revolutionize
modern medicine,

36
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,512
"curing illnesses
that not only scourge our cities,

37
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:21,683
"but cut down more of our soldiers
in the trenches than German bullets.

38
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,854
"I have come here today to request access
to your exclusive archives..."

39
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,773
"...including an ancient Arrowhead

40
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,944
"recently recovered from
the lost expedition of Dr. Albert Falls.

41
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,071
"The Arrowhead represents
the missing piece

42
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,157
"that will finally unlock the location

43
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,784
"of, pause for dramatic effect, the..."

44
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,872
"The Tears of the Moon."

45
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,040
And you made your request, Mr. Houghton,

46
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,960
and the answer remains, emphatically,

47
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,296
- "no."
- Hear, hear.

48
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:56,467
Our archives
are the providence of legitimate scholars,

49
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,637
- not inspired amateurs.
- Hear, hear.

50
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,391
Be that as it may,
since I have your attention,

51
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,811
would you at least allow me
to, uh, continue with my, uh,

52
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,731
examination of how important

53
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,525
the Tears of the Moon could be
to medicine?

54
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,369
- Hello.
- Hello.

55
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,038
- Shaka Zulu.
- Yes.

56
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,790
Through one simple act of innovation,

57
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,918
he came to dominate
all his enemies from the...

58
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,545
There was that,
but also the encirclement tactic.

59
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,215
You are not where you ought to be.

60
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,217
Yes. You're right. Uh, I think I...

61
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,511
The secretaries' gallery is that way.

62
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,971
Thank you so much.

63
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,350
A cure for all ailments,

64
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,228
whether it be consumption,

65
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,231
diphtheria, dengue fever,

66
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:55,151
yellow fever, hay fever,
fever fever...

67
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,654
All fevers, um, would be covered.

68
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,662
Excuse me.

69
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,163
Yes?

70
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,666
This area is for Society members only.

71
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,917
- Is it?
- Yes.

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,460
Oh, I'm so sorry about that.

73
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,671
Well, to be quite frank,
I've no idea how you even...

74
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,935
Mr. Houghton,
we granted you an audience

75
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,646
in deference to your late father.

76
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,441
This, however,
seems remarkably like a paper

77
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:41,781
I had the honor of refusing
when it was submitted by a female writer,

78
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,159
a Dr. Lily Houghton.

79
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,372
No relation, I take it?

80
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,332
None that I've ever agreed to.

81
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,210
Shall we help you
find your way out?

82
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,991
Here we are.

83
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,077
It's in the first crate of the lot.

84
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:12,705
And thank you so much
for your very generous contribution,

85
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,249
in solid gold bars, I might add.

86
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:19,921
Would make life so much simpler
if more people paid in gold.

87
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,174
I don't want the whole lot,
just one thing.

88
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,513
Seems someone got to it before me.

89
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,891
Um, they shouldn't have.
I'm sure it's all there.

90
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,476
It must have just slid somewhere.

91
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,353
Let's... Let's see.

92
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,188
It was definitely there.

93
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,192
- Stop her!
- Oh!

94
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:45,655
Hello. I just wanted you to know,
this is a Nguni assegai.

95
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,532
It's been mislabeled as "Zulu."

96
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,451
Grab her!

97
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:57,750
Oh.

98
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,179
Wait!

99
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,355
The end of the line. Get down!

100
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,655
- Oh, my God!
- No, no, no!

101
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,955
Good day, sir!

102
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,832
You think
you're the first to eject me?

103
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,209
I have been turned out
of some of the best clubs in Europe!

104
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,929
Oh, my gosh!

105
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,351
Fräulein, give me that box
and I will help you up.

106
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,606
- Stop! Stop!
- You are slipping!

107
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,328
Fare, please.

108
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,498
Can I put it on a tab?

109
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,000
You shipping out, lads?

110
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,795
Ha-ha! Bravo!

111
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,677
I think I speak for the entire Society

112
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,681
when I offer my most sincere apologies

113
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,975
to you, Prince Joachim.

114
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:42,104
You just told them my name.

115
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,189
Oh.

116
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,527
Oh.

117
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,083
It is Prince
"Joachim."

118
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,501
Joachim.

119
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,545
- Good.
- Now, Prince Joachim,

120
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,213
we could refund your money from the...

121
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,591
You keep that money, and you tell me,

122
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,302
who is that woman?

123
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,929
I don't...

124
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,892
I do know who that was.

125
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,478
Breaking and entering,
grand larceny,

126
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,481
and worst of all,
forced to take public transport.

127
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,192
Should I be concerned about you?

128
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,694
Why would you say that, MacGregor?

129
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,990
This is a petal that could heal all,
save countless lives, change the world.

130
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,450
Haven't you been dreaming
about another adventure?

131
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,119
If I wanted to go to a primitive backwater

132
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,829
where I can't understand
a word anyone's saying,

133
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,539
I'd visit our relatives in Scotland.

134
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,584
Barely got over that hideous trip
with Father to Bhutan.

135
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,460
You only lost two toes.

136
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,838
- I was seven.
- Then just stay here.

137
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,381
You can. You can just stay here.

138
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,508
Don't worry about me.
All alone, in the Amazon.

139
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,926
But who'd look after you?

140
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,928
Well, I have no idea.

141
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,639
Come on, cheer up.

142
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,391
Steamer to Brazil, rail to Porto Velho...

143
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,893
...then all we need is a skipper.

144
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,124
First of all,
let me congratulate you

145
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,876
on your excellent choice of skipper.

146
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,545
Of all the jungle cruises
you could take in the Amazon,

147
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,339
this one is undoubtedly

148
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,506
the cheapest.

149
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,175
But also the most thrilling.

150
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,927
Are you still giving a tour?

151
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,179
Yes, I am.

152
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,222
- Perhaps a refund?
- No refunds.

153
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,183
We should've taken the other cruise,
honey. Told you.

154
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,032
Skipper!

155
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,785
Skipper?

156
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,997
Skipper! I think you should see this!

157
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,212
Heads up! Coming through!

158
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,428
- Where were we?
- About to die.

159
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,513
Ah.

160
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,057
Skipper!

161
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,477
Sir?

162
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,646
Sometimes these buttons get stuck.

163
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,273
Skipper!

164
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,858
All right.

165
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,457
If you look to the left of the boat,
you'll see some very playful toucans.

166
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,626
They're playing
their favorite game of beak-wrestling.

167
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,002
The only drawback is,

168
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,588
only two can play.

169
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,844
There's two birds, and those are toucans.

170
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,304
I'm saying that only "two can" play.

171
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,473
Not one, but "two can" play.

172
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,100
Wow.

173
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,185
The rocks you see here
in the river are sandstone.

174
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,689
But some people
just take them for granite.

175
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,234
It's one of my boulder attractions.

176
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,613
You know, before this,
I used to work in an orange juice factory,

177
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,906
but I got canned.

178
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,992
- Oh...
- Couldn't concentrate.

179
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,285
Oh...

180
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,619
Yeah, they put the squeeze on me, too.

181
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,165
That's a good one.
I should've opened with that one.

182
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,751
You know, they say
the boa constrictor right there is capable

183
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,253
of eating up to 500 pounds per sitting.

184
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,590
Personally, I find that very hard...

185
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,883
to swallow.

186
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,092
Mommy, can you please make him stop?

187
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,511
No one can.
And don't interrupt me like that again.

188
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,763
I will feed you to the boa.

189
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,972
She is a small child.

190
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,223
He loves small children.

191
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,767
Close your mouth.

192
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,690
Hey! Hey!

193
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,234
Hands in the boat!
Know this about the jungle,

194
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,695
everything that you see wants to kill you.

195
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,072
And can.

196
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,912
Poison angel's trumpet.

197
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,914
Strychnos. Curare. Banana spider.

198
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,962
Marauders, dead of fever,
for never finding the Fountain of Youth.

199
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,175
Adventurers, stung by stingrays,
searching for cities of gold.

200
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,970
Conquistadors, cursed,
for slaughtering innocent natives.

201
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,182
And then there's the ones
that just got eaten

202
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,017
by the deadly hippopotamus.

203
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,894
But hippos aren't native to the...

204
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,020
Shh.

205
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,064
Look out!

206
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:44,573
This is the highlight of the tour.
It's my favorite part of the jungle.

207
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,412
Ladies and gentlemen, get ready

208
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,373
for the eighth Wonder of the World.

209
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,918
Wait for it...

210
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,465
The backside of water!

211
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,886
It looks just like the front side.

212
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,971
It's completely different.

213
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,639
It's the eighth Wonder of the World,
the backside of water.

214
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,225
Guys, get your cameras out, come on.
You don't wanna miss this.

215
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,977
Snap, snap, snap.

216
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,478
Keep snapping.

217
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:19,024
I hope those aren't the Puka Michuna,
the deadliest hunters in the hemisphere.

218
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,276
They hunt humans!

219
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,032
Come on.

220
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,786
Please, go faster.

221
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:34,748
Oh, any faster would damage my engine,
and I can't afford a new one.

222
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:37,877
Grazie.

223
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,961
Prego.

224
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,922
All right, listen up, I get paid
by the number of people I take out,

225
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,758
not by the number of people
I bring back. Hold on!

226
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,972
Ah. Be a good chap and, uh,
take care of the luggage.

227
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,147
Told you not to wear trousers.

228
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,608
Drawing unnecessary attention.

229
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,151
I don't care in the slightest.

230
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,365
Hello.

231
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,543
Well, folks,
you were all outstanding today,

232
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,338
now I need you all out,
standing on the dock.

233
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,049
That means "get off my boat."
I'm only serious.

234
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,133
Au revoir.

235
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,218
Ma'am, don't forget

236
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,386
- to collect your baggage.
- Thank you.

237
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,804
I'm only kidding. He's behind you.

238
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,431
Adiós.

239
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,225
Make sure you take care of Zaqueu,
he's a good kid.

240
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,144
He looks 10, but he's secretly 47.
Thank you, sir.

241
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,232
Look, how stunning. Did you make these?

242
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,817
Beautiful.

243
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,988
Oh, that is awful.
Excuse me, I just think that you...

244
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,656
Let's not start a fight
with a monkey vendor.

245
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,200
I'm not going to start a fight.
They clearly shouldn't be in cages.

246
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,494
Oh, my gosh! Look, there's the boats!
Look, look, look!

247
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,000
Right. I think we've earned ourselves
some nice lunch at the hotel,

248
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,626
then a bath and a cocktail.

249
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,129
We did not travel half the globe
for baths and cocktails.

250
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,173
We must find this Mr. Nilo
and secure our travel. Come on!

251
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,136
Frank owes me money.

252
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,723
Buongiorno, Frankie boy!

253
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,224
Please don't call me that.

254
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,309
Hey, Frankie, you know what today is?

255
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,436
Frank owes me money.

256
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,479
It's the third Tuesday of the month.

257
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,565
My money, Frank. My contante.

258
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,649
Where is it?

259
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,484
Oh, you mean this money? It's all here.

260
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,070
I just need this,
so I can finally eat this week.

261
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,947
The rest è per te.

262
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,910
You insult me, Frank.
This is not all of my money.

263
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,747
This is like a little pinky toe,
nothing...

264
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,416
Itty-bitty, little nothing
of my money, Frank.

265
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,627
You borrow money from me
to get a new engine,

266
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,297
well, you got to pay me back,
plus interest.

267
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,924
Yeah, I'm going to keep
your engine for now.

268
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,802
I get 5,000 real in one week,
then you get it back.

269
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:38,557
I don't get my money in one week,
then I keep your whole boat.

270
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,892
What do you want my boat for?

271
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,727
You have nice boats.
You have all the boats.

272
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,646
Not yet, I don't, Frank.
But I bet you I will.

273
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,940
I'm gonna guess, by next week.

274
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,776
Arrivederci, Franco.

275
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,873
Ugh, what fresh hell is this?

276
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,333
Oh, I love it!

277
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,377
Excuse me, um,

278
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,629
do you know Mr. Nilo...

279
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,758
Classy clientele.

280
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,302
Home again, Rosita.

281
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,430
Mmm.

282
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,423
Hey!

283
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,176
Perhaps I should search
for Mr. Nilo elsewhere.

284
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,886
There's always a chance
he's at the hotel bar.

285
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,097
Fine. But be quick about it
or I'll leave without you.

286
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,016
Oh, that option is becoming
increasingly desirable.

287
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,643
Excuse me.

288
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,770
Um, Mr. Nilo's office?

289
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,857
Upstairs. Thank you. Obri... Obrigada.

290
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,739
How you doing?

291
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,712
Mr. Nilo? Hello?

292
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,046
Frank owes me money.

293
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,967
Ah, there you are. I was hoping
we might have a small business chat.

294
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,510
Not a good chat time right now.

295
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,221
But if you came back
first thing tomorrow morning,

296
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,389
lots of available chat then.

297
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,016
No, I would much prefer now.

298
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,934
My name is Dr. Lily Houghton,

299
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,936
and my brother and I
are looking for passage upriver,

300
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,521
and I'm told that you are
the man for the job.

301
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,316
- You were told wrong.
- That's impossible, because you come...

302
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,859
...highly recommended.

303
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,694
I have an idea. Please go away.

304
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:59,072
Mr. Nilo, your name is plastered
all over the boats outside.

305
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,909
I think you're being a bit unreasonable.

306
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,952
You're the one trying
to break down my door.

307
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,790
I have a lot of money.

308
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,083
Oh.

309
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,882
- You're insistent.
- It's been said.

310
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:24,556
Now, we're headed upriver,
in the direction of the Peruvian Andes.

311
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:28,060
This region doesn't really have a name
on the conventional map,

312
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,938
but it was once known to some

313
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,023
as Lágrimas de Cristal.

314
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,359
You're wearing pants.

315
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,654
Trousers. And yes, as are you.

316
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,197
Do women in England do that now?

317
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,032
Well, we're not in England,
last time I checked.

318
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,660
Now, look, as shocking
as the pants are, I'd really...

319
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,036
Frank owes me money.

320
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,412
Frank owes me money.

321
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,540
Frank owes me money.

322
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,167
- Can I get you a drink?
- Who's Frank?

323
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,461
- I have no idea.
- I will have a little something.

324
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,630
- Spritzer, I assume?
- I'll have whatever you're having.

325
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,340
So, do you know the region, Mr. Nilo?

326
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,467
Well, if it's on the Amazon River,
I know it.

327
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,551
And, lady, I could tell you,

328
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,970
of all the places in the world you can go,

329
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,598
the last place you wanna go
is Lágrimas de Cristal.

330
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,350
Oh, but I do. And I will.

331
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,602
Oh, but you won't, Pants.

332
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,479
You can't get there. Nobody can get there.

333
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,107
And if they could, they wouldn't.
It's not a fun vacation.

334
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,109
Well, I'm not here for a vacation.

335
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,450
Where'd you get the map?

336
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:29,329
Isn't it extraordinary?
The detail and the care he took.

337
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,373
It was drawn by Aguirre's cartographer.

338
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,333
And it belonged to my father,
who used to tell me

339
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,336
all about the Tears of the Moon
when I was a little girl.

340
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:40,382
So, that's why you wanna go?
Your daddy's bedtime stories?

341
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,925
Look, can you get us there or not?

342
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,052
Or has this just been
a colossal waste of my time?

343
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,220
I could get you there,

344
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,389
but you have to consider the dengue fever,

345
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,557
anaconda, plus,

346
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,892
look, lady, that's the home
of the actual Puka Michuna.

347
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,770
They're the ones that like to eat you
and wear your eyes for beads.

348
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,773
Look, lady, I gotta be honest with you,
let's do something that's safe.

349
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,483
So, me, you, and your pants,

350
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,444
we can go for a ride around town.
That'd be fun.

351
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,904
I'll show you some waterfalls.
You look like you like waterfalls.

352
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,156
And I'll also show you

353
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,199
the herd of pygmy elephants we just found.

354
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,534
Let's go see some elephants.

355
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,332
- I lost my key for that thing.
- Did you?

356
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,833
I did.

357
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,211
Well, that's never gonna do it.

358
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,005
You're gonna hurt yourself.
Those are very sharp.

359
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,549
Mr. Nilo, I spent my childhood playtime

360
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,302
with the toddler pickpockets
of Delhi, so...

361
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,511
There we go.

362
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,222
Allow me to manage my own safety,
if that's all right.

363
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,766
Now, shall we negotiate a price?

364
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,477
Or shall I just cast about
for another skipper?

365
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,315
Two beers, two steaks.

366
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,317
Who's paying for all this?

367
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,110
Oh, Mr. Nilo insisted it was his treat.

368
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,320
That's right.

369
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,906
I consider 5,000 real more than adequate.

370
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,825
10,000, I take you there myself.
I am my best captain.

371
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,203
Oh, and your most modest.
Fine, 10,000.

372
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,746
10,000 to bring you there alive.

373
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:55,123
If I have to bring you back dead,
it's 15,000.

374
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,625
Why should I pay more dead?

375
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,711
Dead, I'd have to carry you.
Dead's a lot harder, lady.

376
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,005
20, dead or alive.

377
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,590
Okay, but I get paid in full

378
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:06,009
when we turn back
before Lágrimas de Cristal.

379
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,552
Why ever would we be turning back?

380
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,639
Well, you're gonna beg me to turn back,
first sign of the rapids.

381
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,808
Well, I look forward to disappointing you.

382
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,310
Lily,
look who I found at the hotel bar.

383
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,395
- Ah!
- Mr. Nilo.

384
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,313
Buongiorno, signorina.

385
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,899
He drives a hard bargain,
but he met his match with me.

386
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,360
Negotiated him down to 50,000.

387
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,195
Who's your friend?

388
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:27,864
Not Mr. Nilo.

389
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,741
- Not Mr. Nilo, no.
- No.

390
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,077
So, I suppose that would make you...

391
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,537
Enjoying your meal, Frank?

392
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,622
As in, "Frank owes me money," Frank?

393
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,292
Of course. It's all making perfect sense.

394
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,462
I suppose it's only a scam
if you fall for it.

395
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,674
Well, thank you, Mr. Frank.
I hope we never meet again.

396
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,008
Mr. Nilo, hello.

397
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,388
- Did you just whistle at me?
- 12,000.

398
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,472
Eh, scusa.

399
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,558
- 10,000.
- Aren't you missing an engine?

400
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,227
Signorina, he could not get you
as far as the outhouse.

401
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,438
In fact, his boat kind of
looks like an outhouse.

402
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,815
You're never gonna find a faster boat
in the harbor than La Quila.

403
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:04,276
Plus, she has the finest bath
in all Brazil.

404
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,861
Why should I trust you?

405
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,904
I'm the only one that could get you there.

406
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,584
Oh, my gosh!

407
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,755
Careful. They can smell fear.

408
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,048
I am not afraid.

409
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:30,302
Might be me. Warm, liquid fear.

410
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,274
Shoo.

411
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,613
Everybody stay calm!

412
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,914
- A little bit more fear just came out.
- Shut up!

413
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,845
Ouch.

414
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,204
He did it!

415
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,376
Thank you, thank you. Thank you.

416
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,753
Frank Wolff. Jungle Navigation.

417
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,839
Best rates in town,
completely jaguar-free.

418
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,716
Thank you.

419
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,055
You are a lot of things
that I don't really care for.

420
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,225
But you are capable, so,

421
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,476
12,000.

422
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,602
- 15,000.
- 12,000.

423
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,646
- 15...
- Nuh!

424
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,191
12. Half now, half upon return, alive,

425
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,027
and if we have a deal, I'll meet you
at the docks with our luggage.

426
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,112
- We have a deal.
- Good.

427
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,655
La Quila will be ready
first thing in the morning.

428
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,824
Oh, no, "Frank owes me money,"
we're gonna depart in 10 minutes.

429
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,701
No, it gets dark in two hours.

430
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,785
Does it?

431
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,037
We should probably leave in 10 minutes.

432
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,373
Good decision.

433
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,052
Not now.

434
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,888
I said, not now.

435
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,108
Come here.

436
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,944
You did good, Proxima. You're a good girl.

437
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:56,281
You were a little late,
and you bit me way too hard.

438
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:58,742
But you did good.

439
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,512
Jungle doesn't care
how pretty your dresses are,

440
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,431
you're never gonna get
all your luggage on my boat.

441
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:22,557
Not mine.

442
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,729
Mine. And, I assure you,

443
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,857
every one of these items
is entirely necessary for my survival.

444
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,528
Well, with all this extra added weight,

445
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,906
we'd be lucky to even
get out of the harbor, so, no.

446
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,534
Dinner without a dinner jacket
is hardly, well, dinner, is it?

447
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,619
Now...

448
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,455
be a good chap.

449
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,382
What're you gonna do with those birds?

450
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,258
We're gonna stuff them
and send them to Paris.

451
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,426
No, you're not.

452
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,931
How much?

453
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,936
What on Earth do you think you're doing?

454
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,774
Hey!
MacGregor!

455
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,901
That will need to be
retrieved immediately.

456
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,569
Help, MacGregor!

457
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,613
MacGregor!

458
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,781
No.

459
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,492
Those are my tennis rackets.

460
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,576
It's a river cruise.

461
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,747
- Assorted day wear and shoes?
- No.

462
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,667
Light reading and bathing costumes?

463
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,751
Good.

464
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,963
- The liquor?
- That one can stay.

465
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,132
Now, listen here, you buffoon,

466
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:39,259
if you scuttle any more
of my luggage, I will...

467
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,553
Gosh, there's a lot of you, isn't there?

468
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,430
- Yeah, there is.
- Lily?

469
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,807
Lily?

470
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,730
Hey!

471
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,815
- Nilo! He's got your engine!
- Oh, we gotta go.

472
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:54,941
Not without my sister.

473
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,317
Come on. Get your stuff. Let's go.

474
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,455
Lady!

475
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,251
Let's go.

476
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:16,963
I am not leaving without my toiletries.

477
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,174
Shut down that engine!

478
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,967
Okay, time to leave.

479
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,473
Why are they chasing us?

480
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,016
I have no idea.

481
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,059
Here's the English woman. Pay up.

482
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,568
Lily.

483
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,528
Turn starboard. Resume heading.

484
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,572
What?
I don't know what that means.

485
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:02,425
Lady, look, we gotta...

486
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,802
Oh, God, sorry, Frank.

487
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,136
It's all right. Strong form.

488
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,518
Frank, follow me.

489
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,229
Don't go up there. It's that way.

490
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,692
Lady, it's that way.

491
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,423
Lady! Leave the monkeys.
The monkeys are fine.

492
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,175
Don't go up there.

493
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,565
- Lady, stop!
- Not now, Frank!

494
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,829
How you doing, Pants?

495
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,289
I'm good.

496
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,456
You know, I was trying
to tell you about the...

497
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,375
- I know.
- Come on.

498
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,800
No.

499
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,760
Come on! Lady, jump!

500
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,096
What are you waiting for?

501
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,514
There they are!

502
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,450
- Where's Lily?
- There.

503
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,745
Of course she is.

504
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,804
Okay. Come on, lady.

505
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,868
Tucking in a spot of sightseeing?

506
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,205
How nice of you to join us.

507
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,374
Why didn't you jump in the water?

508
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,417
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- She can't swim.

509
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,419
You booked a river cruise
and you can't swim?

510
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,504
I have no intention of swimming.

511
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,339
And what about the 20 guys
chasing us around town?

512
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:49,717
I may or may not have
something in my possession that

513
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,096
may or may not be of interest
to other interested parties.

514
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,477
Shh!

515
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:10,905
I assume she escaped your grasp, Axel.

516
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,949
Yes, your excellency.

517
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,619
Then I'll take care of it myself.

518
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,790
The Tree is the key to
Germany winning this war.

519
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:31,217
The Arrowhead will show us the way
to the Tree.

520
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,803
We cannot let it leave this harbor.

521
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,013
Surface!

522
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,154
- Who are those guys?
- Oh, my gosh.

523
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,033
The price just went up.

524
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,289
Batten down!

525
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,092
Come on!

526
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,720
- What happened?
- We lost all power.

527
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:18,973
Lady...

528
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,059
Reload!

529
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:24,979
I need you to take the wheel.

530
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,397
No, no, no. I am an excellent driver.

531
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,607
Anyone but you.

532
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,067
Starboard.

533
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,151
- Quick, before he reloads.
- You missed...

534
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,277
Understood.

535
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,822
- It's all yours.
- Oh, thank God!

536
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,967
Frank...

537
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,344
You steal my engine?

538
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,887
Get off my dock!

539
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,806
It's private property, Frank.
You're finished.

540
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:00,890
Ciao.

541
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,945
Sink them
and we can recover the Arrowhead

542
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,321
from the bottom of the river!

543
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,865
Load torpedoes.

544
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,035
- Load torpedoes!
- Torpedo in. Closing the hatch!

545
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,413
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

546
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,584
Closer. Closer.

547
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,839
- Lily?
- Do you know,

548
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,298
- if I were you, Frank...
- Well, you're not me.

549
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,675
I just feel that sometimes
it just needs a bit of a...

550
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,593
This is my engine.
Nobody touches my engine but me.

551
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,389
What did I just...

552
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,893
There you go.

553
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,189
Goodbye.

554
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,443
Is that a...

555
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,028
- Torpedo.
- Oh, my God.

556
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,202
Frank, Frank, Frank!

557
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,704
Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank!

558
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,914
- What are you doing?
- We can't outrun it.

559
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,453
Frank!

560
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,587
Oh.

561
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,441
Look what they did to you.
Poor thing.

562
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,779
I'm so sorry. Machine guns.

563
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,989
Who brings a submarine to the Amazon?

564
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:26,035
But you still outran them. Every time.

565
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,093
I thought I'd keep it casual.

566
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,512
Well, you've really
outdone yourself this time.

567
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,723
Do we know the identity
of our homicidal maniac in the submarine?

568
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,183
No, I don't know his name.

569
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,977
But the youngest son of Kaiser Wilhelm

570
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,145
wrote several articles
about the Tears of the Moon.

571
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,481
And if I had to guess,
I would say that that's him.

572
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:58,734
Aren't you hot in all that?

573
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,611
Not in the slightest.

574
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,907
My eyeballs are sweating.

575
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,663
Are you all right, love?

576
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,757
Oh, my... Oh, my goodness!
MacGregor, look!

577
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,051
Inia geoffrensis!

578
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:27,179
Oh, how beautiful!

579
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,269
You know, here we call them "encantado."

580
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,438
- "Bewitched"?
- Yeah. Shape-shifter spirits.

581
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:38,399
Don't look them directly in the eye
unless you want nightmares for life.

582
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,319
You believe in legends,
you should believe in curses, too.

583
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,114
Okay.

584
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,581
Hey, MacGregor.

585
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,959
Had a girlfriend once, she was cross-eyed.
Didn't work out.

586
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,502
We could never see eye to eye.

587
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,214
Oh, my God.
Is that your idea of a joke?

588
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,424
That is not funny.

589
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,760
I'm also quite sure
she was seeing somebody on the side.

590
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:14,935
Silly.

591
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,741
You know, most people smile
when they're on camera, Frank.

592
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,204
It's a moving picture camera.

593
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,455
Have you never seen one before?

594
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,748
I've never seen a moving picture.

595
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,083
They're so much fun

596
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,668
and you can experience
being anywhere in the world.

597
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:40,920
Ah.

598
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,171
Although, why would you want to,

599
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,006
if you could be here,
surrounded by all this?

600
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,091
It's just...

601
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,551
Oh, it's like drifting
through the Garden of Eden.

602
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,845
It's just beautiful.

603
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,848
Look at this.
Frank, did you see these heliconias?

604
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,439
Do you know
there's more individual species

605
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,149
on one tree in the Amazon than there is...

606
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,246
MacGregor, I think you seem
to be taking us off course.

607
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,539
We should turn that way.

608
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,998
No, we're good. Stay on course.

609
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,458
Lágrimas de Cristal is that way.

610
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,543
- Frank, Frank...
- He's fine.

611
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,044
I think you're mistaken.

612
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,337
I'm not mistaken, I'm the skipper.

613
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,256
The Lágrimas de Cristal is straight ahead.

614
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,340
Stay on course.

615
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,135
Frank, it says on the map
that it's passable.

616
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,887
Here we have that cliff
and exactly that tributary.

617
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:34,014
We can save two days going this way.

618
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,142
We cannot go that way.
We have to go that way.

619
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,601
Lágrimas de Cristal is that way.

620
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,478
We go that way, it's rapids.
You ever been down the rapids?

621
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:40,729
No, but I presume that you have...

622
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,356
- Yes.
- ...which is why I hired you!

623
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:43,899
So just...

624
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,695
turn that way. To the right.
Starboard. Whatever you call it.

625
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,530
I'm not the one who can't swim, Pants.

626
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,199
Don't you worry about that, Skippy.

627
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,330
Lady, it's "Skipper."

628
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,124
My mistake.

629
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:14,930
This godforsaken, endless Amazon,

630
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:18,309
with its infinite tangled tributaries.

631
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:22,146
Dr. Houghton and the Arrowhead
could be anywhere.

632
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,689
There's only one person

633
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:27,526
who has ever gotten close
to the Tears of the Moon.

634
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:31,947
We shall have to ask him directly.
We'll set a new course.

635
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,202
But, Your Highness,
the curse of Don Aguirre...

636
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,914
That's only a legend, right?

637
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,376
We're gonna anchor here
for the night.

638
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,463
Can't we make good time in the dark?
Look, we can just keep going.

639
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:50,132
No, not unless you want
the engine to overheat.

640
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,802
Tell you what, Skippy.
After this day,

641
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,722
I could really do with
that luxurious bath of yours.

642
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,183
Is it, um, down there?

643
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,686
- No, there's no bath down there, Pants.
- What?

644
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,481
No, the bath is out there.
That's the bath.

645
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:08,776
4,300 miles of luxurious bath.

646
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:11,153
I also warmed it
a little bit for you earlier.

647
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:15,032
Oh, and I know you don't know how to swim,
so if you happen to drown out there,

648
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:17,868
go ahead and, uh, use the soap
to wash yourself ashore.

649
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,002
I could do with something to eat.

650
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:29,922
Someone threw all of my reserve food
into the harbor.

651
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,884
You know, Frank, if you think you're going
to cut our trip short by starving us,

652
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,179
let me tell you that
that is extremely likely to work.

653
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:47,189
Do you expect me to eat that?

654
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,240
Oh...

655
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,324
Piranha.

656
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,617
Better eat them before they eat you.

657
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:02,705
No way.

658
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:08,586
Have to say, Frank.
These piranha are so good.

659
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,838
Can't quite place that flavor, though.

660
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,006
It's blood.

661
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,675
Oh.

662
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,851
Right.

663
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,352
I'm to bed.

664
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,522
Sleep anywhere you want downstairs,
just not in my cabin. It's off-limits.

665
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,524
Why on Earth would I want to do that?

666
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,109
Phew.

667
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,280
Bugger!

668
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:43,412
You're staring,
how do I make it stop?

669
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:46,832
I'm just not used to seeing
a woman in pants, that's all.

670
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,752
Awfully interested in my apparel, Frank.

671
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,253
Get your head around it.

672
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,212
You know,
you really bring those eyes to life.

673
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,130
Your perspective's a little off, though.

674
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,298
What?

675
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:38,509
Well, you're right, annoyingly.

676
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,094
- Do you draw?
- I used to.

677
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,261
Why'd you stop?

678
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,013
Well, I drew everything I wanted to draw.

679
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,932
Then I figured I'd learn something new.

680
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,768
Or perhaps you just need
some proper inspiration.

681
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,395
What about you?

682
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,522
Never lack for inspiration.

683
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,524
No, I mean, what're you doing out here?

684
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:57,111
Chasing maps all over the place?
Or is this your idea of fun?

685
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,696
- The Tears of the Moon...
- Oh, come on.

686
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,572
I believe that the legend is real.

687
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,032
- Which it's not.
- And I'm gonna find it.

688
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,701
- Which you won't.
- And when I do,

689
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,203
just imagine the lives
that could be saved.

690
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,456
Legend says one petal from the Tree
will heal anything.

691
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,959
It will change medicine forever.

692
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,253
It's the beginning
of a scientific revolution.

693
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,671
It's very exciting, Frank.

694
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,756
So, you wanna be the Darwin of flowers?

695
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,466
And I want to help
as many people as I can.

696
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,634
Wanna save the world?

697
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:21,927
I didn't say "save the world."

698
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,011
It's very noble.

699
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,805
- Well, thank you.
- It's also very stupid.

700
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,474
You are deeply unpleasant.

701
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,643
And off-key.

702
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,233
So, you'd rather risk your life
and your brother's life

703
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,735
to save people you don't even know?

704
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,695
Well, I don't have to
know someone to care.

705
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,780
Well, I don't have to care
about anybody, period.

706
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,365
That's apparent.

707
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:44,992
Look, I just think if you're lucky enough

708
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,869
to have one person in this life
to care about,

709
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:49,621
then that's world enough for me.

710
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,915
"That's world enough for me."

711
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,000
Hmm.

712
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:58,839
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my...

713
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,007
MacGregor!

714
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,259
Proxima! Proxima!

715
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,261
Heel there, Proxima! Proxima, heel.

716
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,763
Heel.

717
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:06,930
Proxima.

718
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,391
This is your cat?

719
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,601
So, that fight?

720
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,228
- Faked it.
- For goodness' sake, Frank!

721
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,689
Is there a single thing
about you that I can trust?

722
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:16,940
Not a thing.

723
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,073
Great timing.

724
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,039
The natives
speak of this place with dread.

725
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:36,418
This is where Aguirre
and his men were punished

726
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,004
for trying to steal the Arrowhead.

727
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,598
There.

728
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,560
River water.

729
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:59,191
This is what you have been waiting for.

730
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,480
Look who is here.

731
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:42,359
The legend in the flesh.

732
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,863
River water. You want to see more?

733
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:50,450
A long, painful wait
to see the river again.

734
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:53,245
The Tears of the Moon
can break your curse,

735
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,872
free you from this jungle.

736
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:59,334
You want what I need.

737
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:01,712
Detonator.

738
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:09,052
The Arrowhead is near.

739
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:14,349
You will find it for me,

740
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,644
and we both get what we want. Deal?

741
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,731
Swear it.

742
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,066
Good.

743
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,182
Ah, look who had nightmares.

744
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:20,040
All right, we're about to hit
the butter churn. Ready, Pants?

745
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,334
You sure this is the only way?

746
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:25,087
You picked the route.
You wanted to save two days.

747
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:28,006
Uh, "butter churn,"
how literal a metaphor?

748
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,257
If you have anything of value,

749
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,176
I would recommend
that you store it below deck.

750
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:33,845
Since I consider myself of value,
I will see you all on the other side.

751
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,764
Wait a minute. MacGregor.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

752
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,602
Do not lose it.

753
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:43,146
You see that?

754
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,315
I want you to bring that to me.

755
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,900
It's been lovely knowing you.

756
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,527
Don't say that.

757
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,237
Go.

758
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:00,497
Oh, not you again. Go away.

759
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,584
You sure you're up for this, Pants?

760
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,211
Just drive the boat, Skippy.

761
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,339
That ruddy cat!

762
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,383
- What are you doing?
- She's incessant.

763
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:25,397
Here we go.

764
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,821
Oh, my God!

765
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:39,870
You okay, lady?

766
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,830
- I'm fine.
- You wanna turn back, Pants?

767
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,498
Nope. Just getting started.

768
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:46,168
Good. Me, too.

769
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,006
Slow down!

770
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:00,682
You wanna turn back?

771
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:01,808
Just drive!

772
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:27,417
Looks like you wet your pants, Pants.

773
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:28,877
That was the wave.

774
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,170
You should give up.

775
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,214
You should give up the guitar.

776
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,855
Oh, my God!

777
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:10,001
Come on, buena niña.

778
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,762
Come on!

779
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,335
Please don't ever do that again.

780
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:55,130
I could turn the boat around and we could
head back to town, how's that?

781
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,507
That may be the first intelligent thing
you've said since we met.

782
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,845
How about you, Pants?

783
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,346
You ready to go back to town?

784
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,558
No?

785
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,519
I actually loved, uh,
the whole experience.

786
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:12,230
I... I found it, um, exhilarating.

787
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:13,773
You're looking a little green
around the gills.

788
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,401
That's why I'm asking.
Are you okay?

789
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,944
Are you hungry?

790
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,697
Yeah, she's hungry.

791
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,575
Have some cured piranha
if you think you...

792
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,537
You did good...

793
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,383
Did you get it?

794
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:42,802
Ugh!

795
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:44,554
You're drunk?

796
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,474
You're the worst cat I have ever had.

797
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,653
I don't know how you live with that woman.

798
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,948
I've been with her for two days,
and I already wanna throw her overboard.

799
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,325
Does take some getting used to.

800
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,746
Does she ever stop being so, uh...

801
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,873
- Lily?
- Yes.

802
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,458
Afraid not.

803
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,710
Headfirst, figure it out on the way down.

804
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,880
It should be on her crest in Latin.

805
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,469
Hmm.

806
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,310
What you doing?

807
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,693
Your funeral.

808
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,327
It's just a peek.

809
00:54:57,919 --> 00:55:00,005
Your sister says
whatever she wants to say

810
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,548
to whoever she wants to say it.

811
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,800
No regard for anybody's feelings.

812
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,761
Doesn't matter who gets hurt. Usually me.

813
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,097
She takes after our father.

814
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:12,225
He was always chasing after
some far-fetched idea.

815
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:15,437
There's no such thing as curses.
Or cure-alls.

816
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,939
And there hasn't been a conquistador here
for three centuries.

817
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,149
Hmm.

818
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,510
So, why'd you follow her out here, then?

819
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:51,681
It was the third time
that I'd been presented

820
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,224
with an entirely suitable marriage

821
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:57,312
to a charming, educated woman
that sits on a horse well,

822
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:02,108
that I had to tell the lady in question

823
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:04,361
that I couldn't accept the offer.

824
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:08,114
Or, indeed, any offer,

825
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:11,409
given that my interests happily lie...

826
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,245
elsewhere.

827
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,627
Elsewhere?

828
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:22,962
Elsewhere.

829
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,255
Huh.

830
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,299
Well... To elsewhere.

831
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:35,683
Uncle threatened to disinherit me,

832
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,811
friends and family turned their backs...

833
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:40,897
all because of who I loved.

834
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:44,150
I would've been ostracized from society

835
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:46,903
were it not for Lily.

836
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:50,073
She stood by me.

837
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:54,160
And for that,
I would follow her into a volcano.

838
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,676
Pants! Let's shove off!

839
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,057
Would you care to explain this?

840
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,645
I said stay out of my quarters.

841
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:21,938
Oh, I bet you did.

842
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:23,440
So that you could keep
more secrets from us.

843
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:26,818
Just lie upon lie. I mean, Frank,
you are like an onion of deceit.

844
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,862
- What lies?
- That you're after it yourself!

845
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:31,531
I am not after it! Not anymore.

846
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,034
Not for a long, long time.

847
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:36,911
Okay, yes,

848
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,539
I came here seeking
the Tears of the Moon, just like you.

849
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,166
I have a map just like yours.

850
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,712
And a dozen others just like it.

851
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:50,300
Aguirre's cartographer
certainly was prolific.

852
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:53,261
Yeah, well, he lost his life searching
for something that can't be found.

853
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:57,348
I've tracked the legend to every village,
every island, every shoal.

854
00:57:58,183 --> 00:57:59,559
Nothing.

855
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:02,020
And now I'm stuck
on this river ever since,

856
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,689
wishing I could be anywhere else but here.

857
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,198
But you never had this.

858
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:23,541
I'm going to pet you now.
And you're not going to eat me.

859
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,335
Understood?

860
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:27,670
Easing in.

861
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,547
About to engage.

862
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:33,051
You're not that bad really, are you,
for a big, hairy murder cat?

863
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,430
I don't usually offend so immediately.

864
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,391
Lily!

865
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:42,685
MacGregor.

866
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,027
Oh...

867
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,253
Where are they taking us?

868
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,755
We're headed
into headhunter territory,

869
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,591
which is a terrible place to be headed.

870
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:16,135
Oh, Frank, come on, not now.

871
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:17,762
I can't turn it off.

872
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,103
Lily!

873
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,312
Frank!

874
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,232
Frank.

875
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,121
...MacGregor...

876
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,044
What did you say?

877
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:35,048
I said that they should let you
and your brother MacGregor go, and live.

878
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:38,092
In exchange, you'll have to leave
all of your things and your clothes,

879
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:39,510
and I'll stay back as well.

880
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:40,803
That's very, very brave.

881
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:43,139
That is not something I agree to, Frank.
We're not doing it.

882
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:45,683
There's no way that the three of us
can get out of this situation alive.

883
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:47,435
I know these people.
Leave now and let them...

884
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,395
- No!
- Can I please talk for five minutes

885
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,314
without you interrupting me?

886
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:56,277
Oh, now you've done it.

887
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:00,740
Oh, no.

888
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:05,953
"The only thing of yours I want

889
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,331
- "is the Arrowhead."
- No.

890
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:09,874
Don't shake your head like that.
They hate that.

891
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:10,958
They hate that. Don't do that.

892
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,046
"I know you have it.

893
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,882
"It belongs to my people, taken long ago.

894
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:20,802
"You can return it and go free.

895
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:23,054
"Or I can pry it from your fingers.

896
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:26,557
"After I pick them clean of meat."

897
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,393
Oh.

898
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,063
Come on. You heard the nice cannibal.

899
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:33,314
- Hand it over.
- I'm a little rusty

900
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:34,899
in the Puka Michuna dialect,

901
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:38,069
so I want you to translate what I say,
word for word.

902
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:39,153
Okay.

903
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,030
No, I cannot give you the Arrowhead.

904
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:42,657
- Oh, God. Lily.
- Lily.

905
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:43,866
Shut up.
Just say it.

906
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:47,078
Yes, I have the Arrow
that belongs to your people.

907
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:51,165
She's being weird about the Arrowhead.

908
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:52,667
I will return it.

909
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,085
She's extremely difficult.

910
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:57,088
But first I must use it to find
the Tears of the Moon.

911
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,589
It's hard to be around her.

912
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:01,050
Now, if I die for that, so be it.

913
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:03,553
She doesn't mind if you kill her.

914
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:05,680
But you must let these two men go free.

915
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:08,391
Just don't kill me.

916
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,353
Lily!

917
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:15,356
Come on, fight me.
You, come on, fight me.

918
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:17,233
Go! Do it! What's wrong with you?

919
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,943
Lily...

920
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,204
Seriously, Frank.

921
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:33,124
Next time I'm going to charge you more
for this "booga-booga" nonsense.

922
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:34,500
Sam, we had a deal, okay?

923
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,919
No, no. I'm tired,
and this is a whole production,

924
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,671
with these ridiculous costumes!

925
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,006
And you told me

926
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:42,842
this was a nice English lady
with her wimpy brother.

927
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,427
And she's gonna get herself killed.

928
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:46,053
I know, because she's crazy!

929
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,973
She's crazy determined.

930
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,143
Lily, listen, the truth is I didn't get
a chance to call this entire thing off.

931
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:55,104
Remember, it's only a scam
if you fall for it.

932
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,068
You've gotta stop doing that.

933
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:02,737
- Wimpy, eh?
- In a strong way.

934
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:08,910
Strong form.
The whole family has strong form.

935
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,872
Can you translate it?

936
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:14,791
Possibly.

937
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:19,712
Possibly, but, you know,
there are some impediments.

938
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,299
Your English gets very exact
when you want something.

939
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:26,135
I have the tingling impression
we're to negotiate a price.

940
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,345
You get me.

941
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,305
Trader Sam likes a trade.

942
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:30,932
Oh, I bet.

943
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,644
- Would you like that hat?
- Hmm.

944
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:35,853
You can have that hat.

945
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:42,026
You've really done it now.

946
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:47,490
- You think she'll get over it?
- Not likely.

947
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,993
It wasn't personal, you know.
It was a pre-existing arrangement.

948
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,496
Cross Lily like that
and you are dead to her.

949
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,957
Dead and buried.

950
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:58,292
Entombed.

951
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,504
- Embalmed and entombed.
- I got it.

952
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,673
- Dead as a dodo.
- You're making it very clear.

953
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,299
- Dead, dead, dead.
- MacGregor.

954
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:06,717
This beer's actually rather nice.

955
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,803
- It's masato.
- Hmm.

956
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:11,931
It's made out of fermented spit.

957
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:13,641
You're drinking spit.

958
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:20,606
When in Rome.

959
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:26,070
God, I wish I was in Rome.

960
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:28,531
"The Tears of the Moon

961
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:33,536
"possess the power to cure anything."

962
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:36,706
Now, this word here,

963
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:39,333
there's no exact translation
in English. It's...

964
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:43,337
a pain to...

965
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:46,841
the soul.

966
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:50,094
Heal. Heal.

967
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:52,638
Heal the soul.

968
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:53,723
Pretty much.

969
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:54,891
Mm-hmm. Heal.

970
01:04:56,392 --> 01:05:00,396
"To prove yourself worthy,
you must turn water to stone.

971
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:03,149
"Then mend a broken heart."

972
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:04,609
Ooh.

973
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:09,822
"For Tears to bloom,

974
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:13,075
"the great Tree must be
under the rare crying Moon."

975
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,161
There is one in two days.

976
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,580
"The Tree hides

977
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:19,081
"where the Moon bled.

978
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:22,919
"It sank into the west,
over the heart of the serpent."

979
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,045
Serpent.

980
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:27,548
"Where the fang bites its own tail..."

981
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:31,594
"Where the fang bites its tail."
Oh, my goodness.

982
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,471
Now, I told you
it was complicated.

983
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:34,639
Of course no one's ever found it.

984
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:36,515
Right, because it's not
in Lágrimas de Cristal.

985
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:37,975
It's here. La Luna Rota.

986
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,060
Yes.

987
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,189
How long would you say
it would take me to get down there?

988
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:44,273
Two or three days.

989
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:45,650
What about via canoe?

990
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:46,734
Excuse me?

991
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:50,071
Please inform Captain Skippy that
I will be traveling alone from now on.

992
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:51,489
You're never gonna make it alone, Lily.

993
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:54,700
Please tell him that he misjudges
my determination, also my driving skills.

994
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:57,787
Please tell Dr. Pants
that what's out there in the jungle,

995
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,289
she's never read about
in her little textbooks. Tell her that.

996
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,792
Well, I'm not gonna be falling
for any more of his ludicrous tricks.

997
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:03,918
They're getting really tedious.

998
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:06,003
If you go upriver by yourself
with that thing around your neck,

999
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:07,254
- you're never gonna make it out alive.
- Really?

1000
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:08,339
We have to stick together.

1001
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:09,715
- Do we?
- Yes, we do.

1002
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:11,050
"We" is an interesting word, Frank.

1003
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:13,970
Because it sort of implies
a bond of trust and honesty.

1004
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:17,306
Neither of which you know anything about,
because you are a liar, Frank.

1005
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,558
You are selfish, you are arrogant,

1006
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,852
and I wouldn't trust you
as far as I could throw you,

1007
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:24,105
which clearly isn't very far,
because you are huge.

1008
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:25,982
So, there is no more "we," actually.

1009
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,733
In fact, here's the rest of your 12,000.

1010
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:31,028
Oh, and here's a tip
for such wonderful service.

1011
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:37,743
This one is a driver.

1012
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,537
Driver.

1013
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:42,957
Yes. Use that for anything over 200 yards.

1014
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:46,210
Under that, you'll need an iron.

1015
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:52,591
War paint? Righto, yes.

1016
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:55,344
For a warrior. Dilly!

1017
01:06:58,347 --> 01:06:59,724
Tickles.

1018
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:04,395
This doesn't appear to be coming off.

1019
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:07,314
That's 'cause it's tattoo ink.
It'll come off eventually.

1020
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:08,774
In a few decades.

1021
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:10,109
Oh, no.

1022
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:18,075
Francisco...

1023
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:44,477
- Lily!
- Oh... Frank, what?

1024
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,978
- We have to get out of here now.
- What?

1025
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,897
- Give me the Arrowhead.
- Do you think I'm a fool?

1026
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,106
I think you must think I'm a fool.

1027
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,693
Francisco...

1028
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:56,989
Francisco...

1029
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:02,244
- What's going on?
- That's what I was trying to tell you.

1030
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:14,256
No.

1031
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,803
You seem surprised.

1032
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:20,805
It's impossible.

1033
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,559
The myth is real.

1034
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:27,311
After 400 years...

1035
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:28,604
The Arrowhead...

1036
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:29,814
...belongs to me.

1037
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:34,360
- Save your family!
- Yes!

1038
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:38,155
Oh, God!

1039
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:41,742
Frank, Frank! Frank!

1040
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,329
Come on. I got you, Pants. Trust me.

1041
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:30,708
Hold on!

1042
01:09:36,213 --> 01:09:37,840
Frank? Frank, get it.

1043
01:09:39,383 --> 01:09:40,384
- Hold on.
- Come on.

1044
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:43,429
- Frank, please.
- I got it.

1045
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:44,597
- Frank.
- I don't got it.

1046
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:45,681
- Frank!
- Oh, my God!

1047
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:51,103
- Frank, get off me! What're you doing?
- I'm trying to get traction.

1048
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,688
- This is ridiculous!
- No, no, wait.

1049
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:54,607
Just leave me alone!
That was a disaster!

1050
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:55,774
You're too heavy.

1051
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:56,942
MacGregor!

1052
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:58,319
Lily?

1053
01:09:58,736 --> 01:09:59,737
Sorry.

1054
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:31,018
Get off her!

1055
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:38,901
- No!
- Aguirre!

1056
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:55,125
Driver.

1057
01:10:55,292 --> 01:10:56,543
- Lovely shot, sir.
- The Arrow.

1058
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:23,445
No!

1059
01:11:24,738 --> 01:11:25,906
Frank!

1060
01:11:40,337 --> 01:11:41,630
We gotta go! Come on!

1061
01:11:42,214 --> 01:11:44,174
Get in! Grab that knife!

1062
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:46,010
Now!

1063
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,141
Are you all right? What have you done?

1064
01:11:52,224 --> 01:11:53,392
My foot.

1065
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:54,810
It's all right. It's all right.

1066
01:11:54,893 --> 01:11:55,936
Ow, ow, ow.

1067
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:58,772
You must go.
Get out of sight of the river and run.

1068
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:00,399
Aguirre only wants the Arrowhead.

1069
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,443
- Just run as fast as you can.
- Go.

1070
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:05,154
They're coming! Go!
Get away from the river!

1071
01:12:15,622 --> 01:12:16,623
I have her!

1072
01:12:17,624 --> 01:12:18,625
No!

1073
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:20,044
Give me the Arrowhead!

1074
01:12:21,962 --> 01:12:23,714
Aguirre, we're too far from the river!

1075
01:12:44,651 --> 01:12:46,028
Oh, my God!

1076
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:48,655
- It's cool. It's me. It's me.
- Whoo!

1077
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:55,537
Did you see the Arrowhead?

1078
01:12:56,246 --> 01:12:57,289
Have you really seen it?

1079
01:12:57,456 --> 01:12:59,708
Not only have I seen it,
I held it in my hands.

1080
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,251
Finally we can break the curse...

1081
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:02,961
and Francisco shall pay.

1082
01:13:03,128 --> 01:13:05,547
Forget about Francisco!
The Arrowhead, Aguirre!

1083
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:09,218
Only the Tears of the Moon can help us get
out of this curse.

1084
01:13:09,593 --> 01:13:11,553
This jungle is devouring our souls.

1085
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:13,305
We are disgusting.

1086
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,141
Speak for yourself. I am delicious.

1087
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:20,604
Do you really believe we still have souls?

1088
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:25,192
That's why we need the Tears of the Moon,
they are our only hope.

1089
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,986
The woman in pants has the Arrowhead...

1090
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:29,863
and has taken it away from the river.

1091
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:31,865
Because she knows
we can't follow her there.

1092
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:33,200
The Prince.

1093
01:13:35,285 --> 01:13:37,413
He can follow the Arrowhead.

1094
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,415
Tell him where she went.

1095
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:40,833
You heard him.

1096
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:42,709
Tell the Prince.

1097
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:47,172
MacGregor!

1098
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,759
MacGregor!

1099
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,219
MacGregor!

1100
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:54,930
MacGregor!

1101
01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:09,653
Frank?

1102
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:11,822
Frank, you're alive.

1103
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:13,991
How? How are you alive, Frank?

1104
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:16,535
I saw you die.

1105
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:18,203
I saw you fall. How are you alive?

1106
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,872
Lily, I don't care
what you've done for me,

1107
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,957
- if we make it out of here alive...
- Oh, there you are.

1108
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,667
...I am never leaving Kensington again.

1109
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:26,044
- Frank's alive!
- Yeah. Frank's alive.

1110
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,213
Huh. Oh, um...

1111
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:32,384
You've got a little, um,
something in your back.

1112
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:36,805
Frank?

1113
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:40,058
The name's actually Francisco.

1114
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:43,896
Francisco Lopez de Heredia.

1115
01:14:44,062 --> 01:14:45,272
And...

1116
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,567
I'm roughly 400 years old.

1117
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:50,903
- What?
- I know it's a lot to take in.

1118
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:54,364
- I will explain to you the entire story...
- There's no blood in you.

1119
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:55,449
Are you a ghost?

1120
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,117
No, it's complicated.

1121
01:14:57,451 --> 01:15:00,370
But clearly you're... you're not a human.

1122
01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:03,707
Okay, but it's very hard to focus
when I have a sword impaled in my heart.

1123
01:15:04,082 --> 01:15:05,459
Trader Sam, I need you to come and pull.

1124
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:06,543
Vampire?

1125
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:09,087
I told you last time,
I'm done pulling weapons out of you.

1126
01:15:11,298 --> 01:15:12,341
Oh, no.

1127
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:16,845
It is, uh, Dr. Houghton, right?

1128
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:18,597
Of Botany.

1129
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,724
Look at it.
It's just hanging out like that.

1130
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:22,392
Well, it's how it's made.

1131
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:23,560
It's got a very strange shape.

1132
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:25,896
Have you seen it out the back?
It's like... Woo... Like that.

1133
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:28,440
Well, it's not...
It's kinda actually just straight.

1134
01:15:29,566 --> 01:15:31,318
One hand, two hand,
what do you want?

1135
01:15:31,401 --> 01:15:32,402
Let's try one.

1136
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:37,074
You're gonna need two hands.

1137
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:39,117
No, no, no!

1138
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:41,328
- What, what, what?
- Oh, my gosh! That hurts.

1139
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:42,704
- No, it doesn't.
- How do you know?

1140
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:45,290
Frank, would you like
to bite down on my stick?

1141
01:15:45,457 --> 01:15:47,209
- Nope. I'm good. Thank you.
- No, for the pain.

1142
01:15:47,292 --> 01:15:48,418
I understand what it...

1143
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:49,586
What he means. But no.

1144
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,129
There if you need it.

1145
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:52,923
I just feel like
you're very uptight right now.

1146
01:15:53,006 --> 01:15:54,675
And it's not helping me,
'cause I'm very nervous.

1147
01:15:54,758 --> 01:15:56,301
It's okay to be nervous.
It's your first time.

1148
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:57,928
- Ooh!
- It is your first time, right?

1149
01:15:58,011 --> 01:15:59,972
- Yes, you know it is, Frank.
- I know, I know. I can tell.

1150
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:01,807
I've done this hundreds of times.

1151
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,809
- I don't know how to take that, Frank.
- This is special.

1152
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:05,185
- Is it?
- It is.

1153
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:06,395
- Slow!
- What?

1154
01:16:06,478 --> 01:16:07,688
Oh, you can't do it like that.

1155
01:16:07,771 --> 01:16:08,855
- That's way too hard.
- Frank.

1156
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:10,065
Would you like me to give it a wiggle?

1157
01:16:10,148 --> 01:16:11,149
- Yes. Yes.
- Absolutely not.

1158
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,901
I could pop around the back
and give it a once over.

1159
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:15,028
- No, we're good.
- Okay.

1160
01:16:15,195 --> 01:16:18,198
You know what always helps?
If you put your foot on it.

1161
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:20,242
- I'm a little nervous.
- Don't be nervous.

1162
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,286
Frank, I'm gonna count to three.

1163
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:23,870
You're gonna... I'm counting or...

1164
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:25,038
No, I'm counting.

1165
01:16:25,122 --> 01:16:26,873
- One.
- 'Cause... Ahhh!

1166
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:38,427
I dreamt I was lunching at Boodle's.

1167
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:40,429
Hey, Doctor.

1168
01:16:41,638 --> 01:16:42,848
- We should go.
- Of course.

1169
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:44,433
No. You've done enough.

1170
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,101
I can't leave you alone out here.

1171
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:49,062
Look at the state of you.
And you can't even walk.

1172
01:16:49,229 --> 01:16:51,189
Will you at least consider turning back?

1173
01:16:52,482 --> 01:16:55,235
I will be fine. I promise.

1174
01:17:00,574 --> 01:17:01,700
Do I smell?

1175
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:03,410
Horrendously.

1176
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:19,926
We have visitors. Open the hatch.

1177
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:37,903
Good afternoon, my friends.

1178
01:17:46,244 --> 01:17:47,329
Something is there?

1179
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:52,167
What is there?
You have found their river boat?

1180
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:55,879
No?

1181
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:58,840
Not the river boat? The Arrowhead?

1182
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:04,346
The Arrowhead? Yes.
Show... Show me where.

1183
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,640
We're taking orders from a bee.

1184
01:18:06,723 --> 01:18:07,849
Show me on the map.

1185
01:18:10,477 --> 01:18:11,520
Here?

1186
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:13,605
Yes! You heard him. Change course!

1187
01:18:16,149 --> 01:18:18,193
Could you ask the bee for coordinates?

1188
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:22,364
Don't be ridiculous, Axel.

1189
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:25,992
Thank you. Thank you.

1190
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:33,834
395 years...

1191
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,712
...five months and 13 days.

1192
01:18:36,795 --> 01:18:38,672
I really thought you died.

1193
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:43,176
Were you sad when I died?

1194
01:18:43,343 --> 01:18:45,137
I was very concerned.

1195
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:46,263
For my soul.

1196
01:18:46,346 --> 01:18:47,514
For my expedition.

1197
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:50,642
And for you.

1198
01:18:55,188 --> 01:18:56,565
So, what are you?

1199
01:18:57,107 --> 01:18:59,651
You don't bleed, I think you breathe.

1200
01:19:00,944 --> 01:19:02,404
You're not possible.

1201
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:04,531
I don't know what I am anymore.

1202
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:07,659
But I can tell you what I was.

1203
01:19:10,662 --> 01:19:12,372
My father was a mercenary

1204
01:19:12,539 --> 01:19:17,127
and he was recruited
by Aguirre's father in Algiers.

1205
01:19:20,213 --> 01:19:22,883
When my father died protecting him,
he took me in.

1206
01:19:23,049 --> 01:19:25,969
Raised Aguirre and me together,
like brothers.

1207
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:28,555
Aguirre's daughter Anna had fallen ill.

1208
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:32,225
She was all he had.
He vowed he wouldn't lose her.

1209
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:34,436
I will travel far.

1210
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:37,731
But I will come back to you
with a Tear of the Moon.

1211
01:19:38,815 --> 01:19:41,234
And you will run again in the moonlight.

1212
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:42,486
Healed.

1213
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:58,168
We fought the ocean,
only to be beaten by the river.

1214
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,338
The jungle fought our every step.

1215
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,174
I would've done anything
to find the Tears of the Moon

1216
01:20:04,257 --> 01:20:05,717
and save Aguirre's daughter.

1217
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:07,469
Even chart the Amazon.

1218
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:14,518
You were Aguirre's cartographer?

1219
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:16,686
You drew my map?

1220
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:19,523
Frank...

1221
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:21,191
Really think my work is extraordinary?

1222
01:20:21,274 --> 01:20:23,652
I think you were
a minor master of your time.

1223
01:20:23,735 --> 01:20:24,736
Minor?

1224
01:20:29,741 --> 01:20:32,035
One by one, the jungle took us.

1225
01:20:33,745 --> 01:20:37,082
We were all but dead.
Still, Aguirre wouldn't turn back.

1226
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:41,878
There was no world for him
without his daughter in it.

1227
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:43,922
And then they came.

1228
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:49,886
We would've all died had they not saved us
with the Tears of the Moon.

1229
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:52,013
The petal's magic was real.

1230
01:20:52,889 --> 01:20:56,142
Its powers unlocked
by the Chief and his daughter.

1231
01:20:57,352 --> 01:21:00,063
All that was broken, the petals mended.

1232
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:03,191
And all at once, we were revived.

1233
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:05,944
And Aguirre was happy,

1234
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:09,406
because he was closer than ever
to finding a cure for his daughter.

1235
01:21:13,326 --> 01:21:14,744
But he grew impatient.

1236
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:21,042
Aguirre demanded
they give him the Arrowhead

1237
01:21:21,459 --> 01:21:22,502
and take him to the Tree.

1238
01:21:22,752 --> 01:21:24,337
You are not worthy.

1239
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:26,298
The Chief refused.

1240
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:34,723
Despite all the kindness they'd shown us,

1241
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:37,058
he would've killed every last one of them.

1242
01:21:40,478 --> 01:21:41,771
She has the Arrowhead!

1243
01:21:43,523 --> 01:21:45,901
I loved Aguirre,
but I couldn't be part of the madness.

1244
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,402
I'm not going to hurt you.

1245
01:21:47,485 --> 01:21:48,737
I only want the Arrowhead.

1246
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:50,822
And I couldn't just stand by.

1247
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,073
Give it to me!

1248
01:21:55,035 --> 01:21:56,077
Run!

1249
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,121
No!

1250
01:21:58,413 --> 01:22:00,707
A brother's blade cuts deepest.

1251
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:02,250
Traitor.

1252
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,186
The Chief knew
he was breathing his last breath.

1253
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,647
And he used that breath
to protect the Arrowhead

1254
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:25,231
and their sacred Tree.

1255
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:26,900
He cursed Aguirre.

1256
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:31,071
He cursed all of us, so that we could
never leave sight of the river again.

1257
01:22:31,237 --> 01:22:33,031
- Where did she go?
- She can't be far!

1258
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:36,743
Or the jungle would
take us back to it, for all eternity.

1259
01:22:49,005 --> 01:22:51,091
Aguirre hated me for betraying him.

1260
01:22:51,257 --> 01:22:54,135
He found me over the years, and we fought.

1261
01:22:56,179 --> 01:22:57,180
And fought again.

1262
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:02,477
I got tired of being stabbed.

1263
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:05,480
So I made sure he would never hurt me
or anyone else again.

1264
01:23:08,608 --> 01:23:10,151
I trapped them in a cave.

1265
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:11,361
The river!

1266
01:23:11,444 --> 01:23:12,445
Where is it?

1267
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:15,115
Where the jungle
couldn't take them back to the river.

1268
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:16,449
We have to get out of here!

1269
01:23:29,045 --> 01:23:31,172
Francisco, you will pay for this!

1270
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:37,053
And for 300 years,
the jungle ravaged their bodies.

1271
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:39,305
Turning them into
the monsters they are today.

1272
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:42,851
I don't know how they got free,

1273
01:23:43,643 --> 01:23:45,228
but I was safe for a long time.

1274
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:47,105
What did you do?

1275
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:49,941
Well, I made the best of it.
I built a town.

1276
01:23:50,567 --> 01:23:51,735
And that was fun.

1277
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:54,571
Made some friends.

1278
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:58,158
Lost some friends.

1279
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:02,704
That's when I decided
to search for the Tears of the Moon.

1280
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:05,874
I built a boat.

1281
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:11,796
And I named her
after the goddess of the moon, Quila.

1282
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:15,675
I charted every inch of this river,
searching.

1283
01:24:17,093 --> 01:24:18,136
Till I finally gave up.

1284
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:20,472
And since I could never
leave sight of the river,

1285
01:24:20,638 --> 01:24:22,974
I started giving
jungle cruises to tourists.

1286
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:25,310
All that time, all alone...

1287
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:28,104
Well, not entirely alone, of course.

1288
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:29,189
That's right.

1289
01:24:29,272 --> 01:24:32,317
Over the years, I would find strays
that needed someone.

1290
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:34,944
The next, after the next, after the next.

1291
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:37,238
And la próxima, la próxima...

1292
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:38,656
- La próxima?
- Proxima, yes,

1293
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,408
- I name 'em all Proxima.
- Oh, la próxima.

1294
01:24:41,534 --> 01:24:43,453
Oh, but don't worry,
you're my favorite girl.

1295
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:47,624
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

1296
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:49,793
Life is but a dream

1297
01:24:50,668 --> 01:24:52,670
You're meant to join in
on the second verse.

1298
01:24:52,837 --> 01:24:54,672
I'll do it again, shall I?

1299
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:57,092
Row, row, row...

1300
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:59,135
I'm begging you, stop!

1301
01:25:03,139 --> 01:25:04,390
Are we there yet?

1302
01:25:04,474 --> 01:25:05,475
No!

1303
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:10,396
Got one.

1304
01:25:10,563 --> 01:25:12,982
I spy with my little eye

1305
01:25:13,149 --> 01:25:15,485
something beginning with...

1306
01:25:18,988 --> 01:25:20,406
"S."

1307
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,284
Thought you might want a lift.

1308
01:25:24,577 --> 01:25:25,578
Hey!

1309
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:28,498
I don't take lifts
from strangers.

1310
01:25:28,748 --> 01:25:29,874
Cup of tea?

1311
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:36,965
So, how do you enjoy this
jungle?

1312
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:38,633
I beg your pardon?

1313
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:39,926
This jungle.

1314
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:42,178
- Yeah, sorry?
- The jungle.

1315
01:25:42,262 --> 01:25:43,263
Try it slower.

1316
01:25:43,346 --> 01:25:44,347
The jungle.

1317
01:25:44,430 --> 01:25:45,515
Could you pop it in a sentence?

1318
01:25:45,598 --> 01:25:48,935
The trees, the bugs... The... The jungle.

1319
01:25:49,018 --> 01:25:50,645
- The jungle?
- Yes. That is what I said.

1320
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:52,397
- Right.
- How do you enjoy it?

1321
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:53,690
It's actually rather grown on me.

1322
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:55,525
I don't care anymore.

1323
01:25:56,693 --> 01:25:58,736
Sir, we have arrived at the target.

1324
01:25:59,195 --> 01:26:01,906
Ah. Time to make a deal.

1325
01:26:04,367 --> 01:26:06,369
Look, right through here.

1326
01:26:07,787 --> 01:26:10,748
You see the peaceful Puka Michuna tribe?

1327
01:26:10,915 --> 01:26:14,377
With the touch of this button here,

1328
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:17,672
I could end 400 innocent lives.

1329
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:21,968
Their only crime being
that they are still living.

1330
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:26,222
Your sister and the Arrowhead were here.
Now, I need to know where she is going.

1331
01:26:26,389 --> 01:26:27,557
The choice is yours.

1332
01:26:27,724 --> 01:26:31,019
Do they live or do they die?

1333
01:26:34,564 --> 01:26:36,024
- Let me help you.
- No, it's my turn.

1334
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:38,526
Okay. You gotta listen to her.

1335
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:40,612
- It's perfect.
- Pretty good.

1336
01:26:40,778 --> 01:26:42,906
Yeah. Now we can just cruise.

1337
01:26:49,662 --> 01:26:51,873
Do you know how many years
people have been looking for that?

1338
01:26:51,956 --> 01:26:53,583
- This old thing?
- Yeah. That old thing.

1339
01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:55,126
How is it that you turn up with it?

1340
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:56,961
Stole it.

1341
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:58,087
You stole it?

1342
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:01,216
Liberated it. How about that?

1343
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:02,300
Okay.

1344
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:08,640
I've searched for this thing for so long,
but I'm pretty sure it belongs to you.

1345
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:16,731
What are you gonna do
when you find the Tree?

1346
01:27:18,524 --> 01:27:19,984
Lift the curse.

1347
01:27:20,568 --> 01:27:22,445
And what will happen to you?

1348
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:23,738
Well...

1349
01:27:25,907 --> 01:27:28,159
I get to make a choice.

1350
01:27:29,827 --> 01:27:31,829
And I choose to rest.

1351
01:27:34,332 --> 01:27:35,375
Hey, Lily, look.

1352
01:27:35,833 --> 01:27:39,045
Everything that you see
that's new in this world,

1353
01:27:39,462 --> 01:27:42,382
I've seen hundreds of thousands of times.

1354
01:27:43,883 --> 01:27:47,011
Yes, but none of it has been meaningful.

1355
01:27:53,559 --> 01:27:56,437
All right. Where are they?

1356
01:27:58,731 --> 01:28:01,067
I don't actually recognize the specific...

1357
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:02,277
- Where?
- There.

1358
01:28:08,491 --> 01:28:09,492
I think you got it.

1359
01:28:10,576 --> 01:28:12,787
The Tree is here
and will be ours.

1360
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:18,209
I cannot share my discoveries
with their masters.

1361
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,837
You've been down here a while?

1362
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,316
This has got to be "water to stone."

1363
01:28:46,946 --> 01:28:48,656
Do you think that we climb?

1364
01:28:54,912 --> 01:28:56,664
I don't think we're meant to go up.

1365
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:02,378
We're in luck.

1366
01:29:02,462 --> 01:29:04,255
There's a chamber down there
with a lever in it.

1367
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:05,798
I think pulling it is the key.

1368
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:06,883
That's wonderful!

1369
01:29:06,966 --> 01:29:08,301
It's wonderful. It's fantastic.

1370
01:29:08,384 --> 01:29:11,888
Only problem is that
the ancients who built all of this

1371
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:14,515
were on average narrower.

1372
01:29:16,059 --> 01:29:18,644
- Mm-hmm.
- So, it's a great time for you

1373
01:29:18,728 --> 01:29:20,521
to take the finest bath in all Brazil.

1374
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:22,690
- No, no, no. Frank, Frank, please!
- Yes. Pants, listen...

1375
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:24,734
I cannot swim, Frank.
That is not something I can do.

1376
01:29:24,817 --> 01:29:25,818
You've never tried.

1377
01:29:25,902 --> 01:29:27,487
It's not about trying.
I have this very deep fear.

1378
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:28,738
I'll do all the swimming.

1379
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:29,989
- Frank, please.
- Listen... Look,

1380
01:29:30,073 --> 01:29:31,366
I can't do this without you.

1381
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:32,992
I need you.

1382
01:29:34,285 --> 01:29:35,787
You have to trust me.

1383
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:39,374
No, no. Frank, Frank, Frank, please.

1384
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:40,792
I thought you might, uh...

1385
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:42,627
Just turn around
and look at the waterfall, Skippy.

1386
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:45,088
- All right? Please.
- Fine. Whew.

1387
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:48,800
Don't look.

1388
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:51,844
Are you wearing pants under your pants?

1389
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:53,888
- Yes.
- Oh, my God! Frank!

1390
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:55,014
It's okay. It's okay.

1391
01:29:55,098 --> 01:29:56,182
- Here we go.
- I'm not... No, no!

1392
01:29:56,265 --> 01:29:58,267
Wait a minute!
Something just touched my foot, Frank!

1393
01:29:58,351 --> 01:30:00,645
It's okay, it's okay. It was my foot.

1394
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:01,854
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1395
01:30:01,938 --> 01:30:03,314
- I'm very scared.
- Okay. I got you.

1396
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:04,899
It's okay. Breathe.

1397
01:30:05,608 --> 01:30:07,110
- Ready? Okay.
- Yes.

1398
01:32:35,007 --> 01:32:36,008
Lily!

1399
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:38,302
Lily, come on, come on.

1400
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:39,762
Come on. Lily, come on.

1401
01:32:39,845 --> 01:32:41,764
Come on. Come on, Lily.

1402
01:32:43,432 --> 01:32:45,518
What is the matter with you, Frank?

1403
01:32:45,601 --> 01:32:46,852
- You're alive!
- How could you leave me?

1404
01:32:46,936 --> 01:32:49,063
I didn't leave you.
There was a lot of fish down there that...

1405
01:32:49,146 --> 01:32:50,731
What? Fish? Frank...

1406
01:32:50,898 --> 01:32:52,191
There were lot of piranha,
they were coming after...

1407
01:32:52,275 --> 01:32:54,527
- I saved you. Look.
- Don't even look at me.

1408
01:32:54,694 --> 01:32:55,778
Fine.

1409
01:33:13,754 --> 01:33:15,881
"Turn water to stone..."

1410
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:21,387
After 400 years...

1411
01:33:21,929 --> 01:33:23,431
I found it.

1412
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:25,641
We found it.

1413
01:33:31,355 --> 01:33:32,648
Now you can be the Darwin of flowers.

1414
01:33:32,815 --> 01:33:35,735
The petal's right there,
you can be free. You can...

1415
01:33:35,818 --> 01:33:37,445
I mean, it's not like
the river's not beautiful,

1416
01:33:37,528 --> 01:33:38,779
but you can go anywhere

1417
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:41,365
and you can see the world.
You can come to London.

1418
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:43,284
I'm from London. I could show it to you.

1419
01:33:43,367 --> 01:33:45,620
I even have a motor car.
I could be like your skipper,

1420
01:33:45,703 --> 01:33:47,955
Skippy... If you want.

1421
01:33:48,372 --> 01:33:50,791
Lily, I would love
to do all that with you.

1422
01:33:51,334 --> 01:33:52,960
But I've made up my mind.

1423
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:56,213
There is no London for me after this.

1424
01:33:58,174 --> 01:33:59,717
There's no motor car.

1425
01:34:06,515 --> 01:34:07,683
I'm ready.

1426
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:09,060
No.

1427
01:34:09,143 --> 01:34:12,730
It's my time. It was my time long ago.

1428
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:22,865
No. No, I don't accept it.
You could have one more life.

1429
01:34:22,948 --> 01:34:24,116
Luckily for me, it's my choice.

1430
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:27,912
Well, it shouldn't be,
because you have very poor judgement.

1431
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:30,956
But you have your world to go back to.
It's your world.

1432
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,459
But it could be yours, too.

1433
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:40,257
It could be that
one person's world enough.

1434
01:34:53,979 --> 01:34:55,272
Could be.

1435
01:34:59,276 --> 01:35:01,195
Lily...

1436
01:35:04,407 --> 01:35:05,408
Lily.

1437
01:35:15,209 --> 01:35:16,210
Hello.

1438
01:35:16,752 --> 01:35:20,131
Small chance I told a madman with a cannon
where to find you.

1439
01:35:30,641 --> 01:35:32,601
Oh, so, we finally meet.

1440
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:38,065
Wow. Big, strong boy, huh?

1441
01:35:40,276 --> 01:35:43,571
Go to the bridge. Go.

1442
01:35:48,868 --> 01:35:52,872
I believe this belongs to you.

1443
01:35:55,541 --> 01:35:58,711
Now, the Arrowhead, please?

1444
01:36:01,046 --> 01:36:02,047
No, no, no.

1445
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:12,183
Such an imaginative woman

1446
01:36:12,349 --> 01:36:15,770
seeking the Tears of the Moon
to share with the scientific community

1447
01:36:15,853 --> 01:36:20,191
that won't even permit you, Fräulein,
to sit among them.

1448
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:23,944
To put that tremendous power

1449
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:27,490
into the hands of the masses
would be pure madness.

1450
01:36:27,656 --> 01:36:31,494
When I could use the Tears,
not only to win the war,

1451
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:35,790
but to reign for all generations to come.

1452
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:37,625
Take them away.

1453
01:36:42,546 --> 01:36:46,425
Eyes ahead.
Navigate to the Tree.

1454
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:47,570
This Tree is long dead.

1455
01:37:47,736 --> 01:37:51,365
You know more about the Tears of the Moon
than anyone, so...

1456
01:37:52,032 --> 01:37:55,244
you know how to make it bloom.
You will do this for me.

1457
01:37:55,411 --> 01:37:56,829
And when you have what you want,

1458
01:37:57,162 --> 01:37:59,248
what's to stop you from killing us then?

1459
01:37:59,623 --> 01:38:01,417
I could kill you now.

1460
01:38:02,918 --> 01:38:03,961
I'll do it.

1461
01:38:04,128 --> 01:38:07,590
If you promise to let them go
and give me one single petal in return.

1462
01:38:07,756 --> 01:38:11,051
I know the myths and the ancient ways
as if I've lived them myself.

1463
01:38:11,218 --> 01:38:12,219
Frank, do not...

1464
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:15,222
If anyone here is going to bring
the Tears of the Moon, it's me.

1465
01:38:17,558 --> 01:38:21,604
If you can make
the Tree bloom, you may have your petal.

1466
01:38:21,687 --> 01:38:22,938
You have my word.

1467
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:26,901
There's no other way.

1468
01:38:27,067 --> 01:38:29,069
But the little brother stays on the boat.

1469
01:38:29,236 --> 01:38:31,155
Little brother? I have a name.

1470
01:38:52,676 --> 01:38:54,637
Wow, it is wonderful.

1471
01:38:56,013 --> 01:38:57,556
Go ahead.

1472
01:39:12,363 --> 01:39:14,073
The Arrowhead should fit here.

1473
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:17,660
- You better go help him. Go.
- No.

1474
01:39:18,285 --> 01:39:19,703
No?

1475
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:25,250
I'll do it if you give me a petal as well.

1476
01:39:26,418 --> 01:39:29,588
If I give you a petal as well...

1477
01:39:29,755 --> 01:39:32,466
One petal. Not two. You must choose.

1478
01:39:32,633 --> 01:39:35,094
What do you think, Muscles?

1479
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:39,682
Will you sacrifice your petal for her?

1480
01:39:41,767 --> 01:39:43,227
She'd have to kill me first.

1481
01:39:45,104 --> 01:39:46,438
Ja?

1482
01:39:51,276 --> 01:39:52,903
- Done.
- Done.

1483
01:40:00,869 --> 01:40:02,496
"Broken-hearted warrior

1484
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:05,207
"climbed to the highest peak

1485
01:40:05,374 --> 01:40:07,793
"and shot his arrow into the Moon.

1486
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:11,338
"From there, the Moon learned real pain
and began to weep.

1487
01:40:11,505 --> 01:40:14,466
"Where the Tears fell
grew a sacred Tree..."

1488
01:40:19,054 --> 01:40:21,557
Rum-pum-pum-pum...

1489
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:26,729
Give me the Arrow.

1490
01:40:32,985 --> 01:40:33,986
Hurry up!

1491
01:40:42,494 --> 01:40:45,497
Trader Sam said we would need
to fix a broken heart.

1492
01:40:45,664 --> 01:40:48,542
It's not an Arrowhead, it's a heart.

1493
01:40:49,084 --> 01:40:50,836
You can't mend a heart that isn't...

1494
01:40:50,919 --> 01:40:52,337
...broken.

1495
01:42:37,818 --> 01:42:39,278
I'll take that petal now.

1496
01:43:00,215 --> 01:43:01,884
"Under the crying Moon..."

1497
01:43:02,593 --> 01:43:06,013
We must pluck the petals before it sets.
Go! Hurry!

1498
01:43:31,079 --> 01:43:32,080
Every time.

1499
01:43:32,206 --> 01:43:33,207
Sorry.

1500
01:43:47,304 --> 01:43:48,847
Shoot!

1501
01:43:54,144 --> 01:43:55,854
Good murder cat.

1502
01:43:59,107 --> 01:44:00,234
Where's Lily?

1503
01:44:00,943 --> 01:44:01,944
Up there.

1504
01:44:02,861 --> 01:44:04,780
Here we go again.

1505
01:44:10,786 --> 01:44:11,995
The Moon's setting.

1506
01:44:12,162 --> 01:44:13,205
The Tree is dying.

1507
01:44:23,674 --> 01:44:24,716
Whoa.

1508
01:44:34,393 --> 01:44:35,394
Come on.

1509
01:44:40,315 --> 01:44:41,316
Yes!

1510
01:44:47,322 --> 01:44:49,032
Lily!

1511
01:44:59,501 --> 01:45:04,756
This is a amusingly familiar
situation, no?

1512
01:45:06,216 --> 01:45:07,801
Give me that petal.

1513
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:10,387
- No.
- You are about to die

1514
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:14,474
one way or another,
but if you do not give me that petal,

1515
01:45:14,641 --> 01:45:16,184
so, too, will your brother.

1516
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:20,897
His will be much more slower.

1517
01:45:22,316 --> 01:45:23,817
Give me that petal.

1518
01:45:33,493 --> 01:45:36,330
Just one is enough. Give it to me.

1519
01:45:40,792 --> 01:45:42,669
Never.
Frank!

1520
01:45:42,919 --> 01:45:43,920
Let go of me!

1521
01:45:48,925 --> 01:45:50,344
Take the wheel. Hold her steady.

1522
01:46:13,075 --> 01:46:14,743
You're the best cat I've ever had.

1523
01:46:19,581 --> 01:46:20,749
Get off!

1524
01:46:23,543 --> 01:46:25,754
It looks like
you haven't been very nice...

1525
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:27,881
to my little friends.

1526
01:46:28,048 --> 01:46:30,008
Aguirre,
help me to get the petal!

1527
01:46:30,092 --> 01:46:33,470
I'll give you anything you want!
Money, ships...

1528
01:46:33,845 --> 01:46:34,971
Spain!

1529
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:37,265
Royalty is not to be trusted.

1530
01:46:43,313 --> 01:46:45,023
Aguirre, the woman in pants...

1531
01:46:47,651 --> 01:46:48,902
Get her!

1532
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:56,910
Aguirre!

1533
01:46:59,246 --> 01:47:00,414
Francisco has the petal!

1534
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:04,292
Stop him!

1535
01:47:10,882 --> 01:47:12,592
- This is where you get off.
- What?

1536
01:47:13,677 --> 01:47:15,720
Tell Lily she would've been
world enough for me.

1537
01:47:15,804 --> 01:47:16,805
Where are you going?

1538
01:47:16,888 --> 01:47:20,684
Proxima. You protect him,
you're in charge. Go.

1539
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:23,937
Goodbye, girl.

1540
01:47:37,451 --> 01:47:40,454
Let's give 'em one last cruise,
mi buena niña.

1541
01:47:41,121 --> 01:47:42,497
There's only one way to end this.

1542
01:47:42,664 --> 01:47:43,874
Come and get me.

1543
01:47:48,503 --> 01:47:50,297
Lily.

1544
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:13,612
He's going to crash.

1545
01:48:15,655 --> 01:48:17,491
No, he's gonna block the river.

1546
01:48:43,058 --> 01:48:44,059
Francisco!

1547
01:48:44,726 --> 01:48:45,977
Give me the petal!

1548
01:48:46,061 --> 01:48:47,729
He has the petal in his pocket!

1549
01:48:49,105 --> 01:48:50,607
Enough is enough!

1550
01:48:50,982 --> 01:48:53,276
It's now time for you to die!

1551
01:48:53,735 --> 01:48:54,778
Right.

1552
01:48:54,861 --> 01:48:56,780
I think we've had quite enough of you.

1553
01:49:01,910 --> 01:49:03,495
Good night.

1554
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:15,507
Not exactly what I intended.

1555
01:49:27,852 --> 01:49:30,730
A brother's blade cuts deepest.

1556
01:49:38,613 --> 01:49:40,782
Give me the petal.

1557
01:49:40,949 --> 01:49:42,325
He told me to tell you,

1558
01:49:42,409 --> 01:49:44,369
you would have been world enough for him.

1559
01:49:45,495 --> 01:49:46,955
Where's the petal?

1560
01:49:54,212 --> 01:49:55,547
I'm sorry, old friend.

1561
01:49:56,089 --> 01:49:57,674
He wanted you to have it.

1562
01:49:59,718 --> 01:50:01,636
Stop the boat! Stop it!

1563
01:50:01,803 --> 01:50:03,305
- Frank.
- Wait.

1564
01:50:04,848 --> 01:50:06,308
Frank, no!

1565
01:50:06,474 --> 01:50:08,602
No!

1566
01:50:43,762 --> 01:50:45,055
Francisco, what have you done?

1567
01:50:45,555 --> 01:50:47,724
This is worse than death! This is torture!

1568
01:51:30,475 --> 01:51:35,063
Oh, you are the most infuriating man
I've ever met.

1569
01:51:45,615 --> 01:51:46,991
Lily...

1570
01:53:13,453 --> 01:53:14,454
Frank.

1571
01:53:32,514 --> 01:53:33,515
Frank!

1572
01:53:43,274 --> 01:53:44,359
Oh, you're bleeding.

1573
01:53:44,442 --> 01:53:45,735
That hurts.

1574
01:53:45,819 --> 01:53:46,903
- It does?
- Yeah.

1575
01:53:46,986 --> 01:53:47,987
Well, that's good.

1576
01:53:48,655 --> 01:53:49,823
I can't believe you shot me.

1577
01:53:49,906 --> 01:53:51,407
- I know.
- Twice.

1578
01:53:51,574 --> 01:53:52,951
I know, but you didn't go down
the first time.

1579
01:53:53,034 --> 01:53:54,661
You should've just gone down.

1580
01:54:03,002 --> 01:54:04,921
You're both my world.

1581
01:54:38,830 --> 01:54:40,123
Well, well, well...

1582
01:54:40,206 --> 01:54:41,541
Nilo. Now you have all the boats.

1583
01:54:41,624 --> 01:54:43,751
Take care of her.

1584
01:54:48,756 --> 01:54:51,968
I stand before you today
to tell you about the Tears of the Moon.

1585
01:54:52,176 --> 01:54:53,469
The legend is true.

1586
01:54:55,096 --> 01:54:59,809
Our party traveled further into the Amazon
than any expedition had previously dared.

1587
01:55:01,603 --> 01:55:04,731
On our trip,
the lines between life and death,

1588
01:55:04,814 --> 01:55:06,691
past and present, vanished.

1589
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:10,236
I witnessed things not to be believed.

1590
01:55:10,653 --> 01:55:13,948
Enchanted dolphins
that could haunt one's dreams.

1591
01:55:14,282 --> 01:55:15,867
Undead conquistadors,

1592
01:55:15,950 --> 01:55:19,370
cursed as prisoners of the jungle
for nearly 400 years.

1593
01:55:20,038 --> 01:55:22,081
A tribe whose chief, a lady...

1594
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,836
No! It actually worked rather well.

1595
01:55:27,462 --> 01:55:29,839
My point is, this was a journey

1596
01:55:29,923 --> 01:55:32,467
the likes of which
this society has never seen.

1597
01:55:32,884 --> 01:55:35,929
An adventure truly worthy
of this association.

1598
01:55:36,846 --> 01:55:41,017
But is this association
worthy of our great adventure?

1599
01:55:41,559 --> 01:55:44,270
You see, we didn't seek
the Tears of the Moon

1600
01:55:44,354 --> 01:55:46,481
so that we could be written up
in some journal

1601
01:55:46,564 --> 01:55:48,232
for a load of crusty old farts.

1602
01:55:49,943 --> 01:55:53,237
My sister, who just made
full professor at Cambridge,

1603
01:55:53,404 --> 01:55:55,657
has asked me to respectfully reject

1604
01:55:55,740 --> 01:55:58,201
your invitation of membership
on her behalf.

1605
01:55:58,368 --> 01:56:01,037
Which I will do. Just not respectfully.

1606
01:56:01,204 --> 01:56:03,957
Gentlemen, you can take your invitation

1607
01:56:04,499 --> 01:56:07,335
and you can shove it up your association.

1608
01:56:09,796 --> 01:56:11,506
How dare you!

1609
01:56:17,512 --> 01:56:19,639
Ready for your first driving lesson?

1610
01:56:20,181 --> 01:56:21,766
I think so, Pants.

1611
01:56:23,184 --> 01:56:26,562
I hope you know what you're
getting yourself into here, Frank.

1612
01:56:26,729 --> 01:56:27,730
A car.

1613
01:56:27,814 --> 01:56:29,107
Oh, your jokes.

1614
01:56:29,190 --> 01:56:31,150
They will be the death of me.

1615
01:56:31,234 --> 01:56:33,778
They are absolutely exhausting.

1616
01:56:36,114 --> 01:56:37,323
Wow, Lily.

1617
01:56:37,490 --> 01:56:39,534
- Did you like it?
- It was good.

1618
01:56:39,617 --> 01:56:40,702
- Yeah.
- Are you proud?

1619
01:56:40,785 --> 01:56:42,203
Oh! Frank, Frank, Frank!

1620
01:56:42,286 --> 01:56:43,746
- Oh, my goodness!
- Okay, I got it.

1621
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:45,081
Frank, for goodness' sake!

1622
01:56:45,164 --> 01:56:47,083
- I got it, I got it.
- Turn now! Turn now! Turn now!

1623
01:56:47,166 --> 01:56:49,502
I got it all under control, Pants.

1623
01:56:50,305 --> 01:57:50,479
